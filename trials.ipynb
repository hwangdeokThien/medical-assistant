The hallmark features of thissyndrome are poorly developed fingernails, toenails, andpatellae (kneecaps). Other common abnormalitiesinclude elbow deformities, abnormally shaped pelvisbone (hip bone), and kidney (renal) disease.\\nLess common medical findings include defects of\\nthe upper lip, the roof of the mouth, and unusual skeletalabnormalities. Skeletal abnormalities may include poor-ly developed scapulae (shoulder blades), sideways bentfingers (clinodactyly), clubfoot ,scoliosis , and unusual\\nneck bones. There are also other effects, such as thick-ening of the basement membrane in the skin and of thetiny clusters of capillaries (glomeruli) in the kidney. Sci-entists have recognized an association between nail-patella syndrome and colon cancer . Nail-patella syn-\\ndrome is associated with open-angle glaucoma , which,\\nif untreated, may lead to blindness. Patients may alsohave cataracts , drooping eyelids ( ptosis ), or corneal\\nproblems such as glaucoma.\\nPeople with nail-patella syndrome may display only a\\nfew or many of the recognized signs of this disease. Symp-toms vary widely from person to person. Signs even varywithin a single family with multiple affected members.\\nThe incidence of nail-patella syndrome is approxi-\\nmately one in 50,000 births. This disorder affects malesand females equally. It is found throughout the world andoccurs in all ethnic groups. The strongest risk factor fornail-patella syndrome is a family history of the disease.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nNail-patella syndrome has been recognized as an\\ninherited disorder for over 100 years. It is caused bymutations in a gene known as LIM Homeobox Transcrip-tion Factor 1-Beta (LMX1B), located on the long arm ofchromosome 9.\\nThe LMX1B gene codes for a protein that is impor-\\ntant in organizing embryonic limb development. Muta-tions in this gene have been detected in many unrelatedpeople with nail-patella syndrome. Scientists have alsobeen able to interrupt this gene in mice to produce defectssimilar to those seen in human nail-patella syndrome.\\nNail-patella syndrome is inherited in an autosomal\\ndominant manner. This means that possession of only onecopy of the defective gene is enough to cause disease. Whena parent has nail-patella syndrome each of their children hasa 50% chance to inherit the disease-causing mutation.\\nA new mutation causing nail-patella syndrome can\\nalso occur, causing disease in a person with no family his-tory. This is called a sporadic occurrence and accounts forapproximately 20% of cases of nail-patella syndrome. Thechildren of a person with sporadic nail-patella syndromeare also at a 50% risk of developing signs of the disorder.\\nMedical signs of nail-patella syndrome vary widely\\nbetween patients. Some patients with this disorder do notdisplay symptoms. These patients are discovered to havethe nail-patella syndrome only when genetic studies tracetheir family history. Scientists are now working to learnwhat causes different people to display such differentsymptoms of nail-patella syndrome.N\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2307'),\n",

Fingernail abnormalities are found in over 80% ofpatients with this disorder. Abnormalities may be foundin one or more fingernails. Only rarely are all fingernailsaffected. This disease most commonly affects the finger-nails of the thumbs and index fingers. The pinky finger-nail is least likely to be affected. Fingernails may besmall and concave with pitting, ridges, splits, and/or dis-coloration. Toenails are less often affected. The lunulae,or light-colored crescent moons, at the base of the finger-nail bed next to the cuticle are sometimes triangularly-shaped in people with nail-patella syndrome.\\nKneecap abnormalities are the second most common\\nsign associated with this disorder. Either or bothkneecaps may be missing or poorly formed. If present,kneecaps are likely to be dislocated. The knees of peoplewith nail-patella syndrome may have a square appear-ance. Besides the kneecap, other support structuresincluding bones, ligaments, and tendons may also bemalformed. These support structures stabilize the knee,therefore patients with some leg malformations may havedifficulty in walking.\\nThe hip bones of approximately 80% of patients\\nwith nail-patella syndrome have unusual bony projec-tions called posterior iliac horns. These bony projections,or spurs, are internal and not obvious unless they aredetected on x ray. This unusual pelvic anatomy is notassociated with any other disease.\\nKidney disease is present in at least 30% of people\\nwith nail-patella syndrome. Biopsy shows lesions thatresemble those of inflammation of the clusters of capil-laries in the kidneys ( glomerulonephritis ), but without\\nany infection present. Kidney failure is the most danger-ous consequence of nail-patella syndrome. It occurs inabout 30% of patients who have kidney involvement. Anearly sign of kidney involvement is the presence of pro-tein or blood in the urine (chronic, benign proteinuriaand hematuria.) Kidney involvement is progressive, soearly diagnosis and treatment of renal disease is impor-tant. Kidney disease has been reported in children withnail-patella syndrome, but renal involvement more com-monly develops during adulthood.\\nVarious skeletal symptoms may occur. Patients with\\nnail-patella syndrome may not be able to fully straightentheir arms at the elbow. This may create a webbed appear-ance at the elbow joint. Patients may have sideways bentfingers, poorly developed shoulder blades, clubfoot, hipdislocation, unusual neck bones, or scoliosis.\\nEye problems may be present and vary from person\\nto person. Nail-patella syndrome is associated with openangle glaucoma. Open angle glaucoma is caused by fluidblocked into the front chamber of the eye. This blocked\\nfluid builds increasing pressure into the eye. If untreated,this increased pressure may lead to permanent damage ofthe optic nerve and irreversible blindness. Some patientswith nail-patella syndrome have ptosis, or drooping eye-lids. Nail-patella syndrome has also been associated withabnormalities of the cornea, cataracts, and astigmatism .\\nAdditionally, the irises of the eye may be multicolored,possibly displaying a clover-shaped pattern of color.\\nDiagnosis\\nAs of early 2001, genetic testing for nail-patella\\nsyndrome is available only through research institutionsthat are working to further characterize this disorder.Genetic testing cannot predict which signs of the diseasewill develop. Nor can genetic testing predict the severityof disease symptoms. Improved genetic testing for nail-patella syndrome is anticipated in the future.\\nDiagnosis of this disease is most often made on\\nvisual medical clues such as the characteristic abnormali-ties of the fingernails and kneecaps. Diagnosis is con-firmed by x-ray images of the affected bones and, whenindicated, kidney biopsy . The bony pelvic spurs found\\nin 80% of patients with nail-patella syndrome are notassociated with any other disease.\\nPrenatal diagnosis for nail-patella syndrome by\\nthird-trimester ultrasound was documented in 1998. Pre-natal diagnosis via genetic testing of cells obtained bychorionic villus sampling was reported the same year.\\nAs of 2001, prenatal genetic testing for nail-patella syn-drome is not yet widely available. There is controversysurrounding the use of prenatal testing for such a variabledisorder. Prenatal testing cannot predict the extent of anindividual’s disease.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment is usually not necessary. Treatment, when\\nrequired, depends on each patient’s specific symptoms.Severe kidney disease is treated with dialysis or a kidneytransplant. Patients receiving kidney transplant do not devel-op nail-patella type renal complications in their new kidney.\\nA wheelchair may be required if walking becomes\\npainful due to bone, tendon, ligament, or muscle defects.Orthopedic surgery may be necessary for congenital\\nclubfoot deformity. Manipulation or surgery may berequired to correct hip dislocation. Cataracts are also sur-gically treated. Medical treatment at early signs of glau-coma prevents progression of the disease to blindness.\\nGenetic counseling is offered to persons who have\\nthe disease.

There are nonsurgical as\\nwell as surgical methods of nail removal.\\nPurpose\\nNails are removed only when necessary to allow the\\nskin beneath the nail (the nail bed) to heal or in somecases, to remove a nail that has been partially pulled outin an accident. In the case of toenails, it is occasionallynecessary to remove the nail of the large toe due to achronic condition caused by badly fitted shoes. In gener-al, however, doctors prefer to try other forms of treatmentbefore removing the nail. Depending on the cause, naildisorders are usually treated with oral medications;applying medicated gels or creams directly to the skinaround the nail; avoiding substances that irritate the nailfolds; surgical lancing of abscesses around the nail; orinjecting corticosteroids under the nail fold.\\nThe most common causes of nail disorders include:\\n• Trauma. The nails can be damaged by nail biting, using\\nthe fingernails as tools, and incorrect use of nail filesand manicure scissors as well as by accidents andsports injuries .\\n• Infections. These include fungal infections under the\\nnails, bacterial infections of cuts or breaks in the nailfolds, or infections of the nails themselves caused byCandida albicans . Inflammation of the nail folds is\\ncalled paronychia.\\n• Exposure to harsh detergents, industrial chemicals, hot\\nwater, and other irritants. People who work as dish-washers are especially vulnerable to separation of thenail itself from the nail bed (onycholysis).\\n• Systemic diseases and disorders. These include psoria-\\nsis, anemia, and certain congenital disorders.\\n• Allergic reactions to nail polish, polish remover, or the\\nglue used to attach false nails.\\nPrecautions\\nIn the case of infections, it is necessary to distin-\\nguish between fungal, bacterial, and candidal infectionsbefore removing the nail. Cultures can usually beobtained from pus or tissue fluid from the affected nail.\\nDescription\\nSurgical nail removal\\nIf necessary, the surgeon can remove the nail at its\\nbase with an instrument called a needlepoint scalpel. In afew cases, the nail may need to be pulled out (avulsed)from its matrix.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2309Nail removal'),\n",

The sleepiness has been compared to thefeeling of trying to stay awake after not sleeping for twoor three days.\\nPeople with narcolepsy fall asleep suddenly—any-\\nwhere, at any time, maybe even in the middle of a con-versation. These sleep attacks can last from a few sec-onds to more than an hour. Depending on where theyoccur, they may be mildly inconvenient or even danger-ous to the individual. Some people continue to functionoutwardly during the sleep episodes, such as talking orputting things away. But when they wake up, they haveno memory of the event.\\nNarcolepsy is related to the deep, dreaming part of\\nsleep known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Nor-mally when people fall asleep, they experience 90 min-utes of non-REM sleep, which is then followed by REMsleep. People with narcolepsy, however, enter REM sleepimmediately. In addition, REM sleep occurs inappropri-ately throughout the day.\\nThere has been debate over the incidence of nar-\\ncolepsy. It is thought to affect between one in every1,000 to 2,000 Americans. The known prevalence inother countries varies, from one in 600 in Japan to onein 500,000 in Israel. Reasons for these differences arenot clear.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn 1999 researchers identified the gene that causes\\nnarcolepsy. The gene allows cells in the hypothalamus(the part of the brain that regulates sleep behavior) toreceive messages from other cells. When this gene isabnormal, cells cannot communicate properly, andabnormal sleeping patterns develop.\\nThe disorder sometimes runs in families, but most\\npeople with narcolepsy have no relatives with the disor-der. Researchers believe that the inheritance of narcolep-sy is similar to that of heart disease. In heart disease, sev-eral genes play a role in being susceptible to the disorder,but it usually does not develop without an environmentaltrigger of some sort.\\nWhile the symptoms of narcolepsy usually appear\\nduring the teens or 20s, the disease may not be diagnosedfor many years. Most often, the first symptom is an over-whelming feeling of fatigue . After several months or\\nyears, cataplexy and other symptoms appear.\\nCataplexy is the most dramatic symptom of nar-\\ncolepsy. It affects 75% of people with the disorder. Dur-ing attacks, the knees buckle and the neck muscles goslack. In extreme cases, the person may become para-lyzed and fall to the floor. This loss of muscle tone istemporary, lasting from a few seconds to half an hour,\\nbut frightening. The attacks can occur at any time butare often triggered by strong emotions, such as anger,joy, or surprise.\\nOther symptoms of narcolepsy include:\\n• sleep attacks: short, uncontrollable sleep episodes\\nthroughout the day\\n• sleep paralysis : a frightening inability to move shortly\\nafter awakening or dozing off\\n• auditory or visual hallucinations : intense, sometimes\\nterrifying experiences at the beginning or end of a sleepperiod\\n• disturbed nighttime sleep: tossing and turning, night-\\nmares, and frequent awakenings during the night\\nDiagnosis\\nIf a person experiences both excessive daytime\\nsleepiness and cataplexy, a diagnosis may be made on thepatient history alone. Laboratory tests, however, can con-firm a diagnosis. These may include an overnightpolysomnogram—a test in which sleep is monitored withelectrocardiography , video, and respiratory parameters.\\nA Multiple Sleep Latency Test, which measures sleeplatency (onset) and how quickly REM sleep occurs, maybe used. People who have narcolepsy usually fall asleepin less than five minutes.\\nIf a diagnosis is in question, a genetic blood test can\\nreveal the existence of certain substances in people whohave a tendency to develop narcolepsy. Positive testresults suggest, but do not prove, the existence of nar-colepsy.\\nNarcolepsy is a complex disorder, and it is often\\nmisdiagnosed. It takes 14 years, on average, for an indi-vidual to be correctly diagnosed.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no cure for narcolepsy. It is not progressive,\\nand it is not fatal, but it is chronic. The symptoms can bemanaged with medication or lifestyle adjustment.Amphetamine-like stimulant drugs are often prescribedto control drowsiness and sleep attacks. Patients who donot like taking high doses of stimulants may choose totake smaller doses and “manage” their lifestyles, such asby napping every couple of hours, to relieve daytimesleepiness. Antidepressants are often effective in treatingsymptoms of abnormal REM sleep.\\nWith the recent discovery of the gene that causes\\nnarcolepsy, researchers are hopeful that therapies can bedesigned to relieve the symptoms of the disorder.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2311Narcolepsy'),\n",

It maybe performed by adding antibiotics to the solution to treatnasal polyps , nasal septal deviation, allergic nasal inflam-\\nmation, chronic sinus infection, and swollen mucousmembranes.

In the case of nosebleeds,\\npacking is left in for extended periods of time to promotehealing and to prevent the patient from removing scar tis-sue which might reopen the wound. If both sides of thenose are packed, the patient must breathe through his orher mouth while the packs are in place.\\nIn patients who are chronic nose pickers, frequent\\nbleeding is common and ulceration of nasal tissue is pos-sible. To promote healing and to prevent nose picking,both sides of the nose are packed with cotton that con-tains antibiotics. The nose is taped shut with surgical tapeto prevent the packing from being removed. The packingis left in the nose for seven to 10 days. If the wound ishigh up in the nasal cavity, gauze strips treated withpetrolatum and antibiotics are used. The strips are placedinto the nose one layer at a time, folding one layer on topof the other until the area is completely packed.\\nLocal packing is a procedure used when only a small\\npart of the nose must be packed. Typically, this occurswhen one blood vessel is prone to bleeding, and there isno need to block breathing through the nose. Local pack-ing is used when the pack can remain in place by itself.This situation can be found at the turbinates. Turbinatesare folds of tissue on the insides of the nose. The foldsare sufficiently firm to support packing. A small piece ofgauze or cotton is wedged in between the turbinateswhere the blood vessel being treated is located. Localpacking is left in place for up to 48 hours and thenremoved. The main advantage to this type of packing isthat it enables the patient to breathe through his or hernose. Local packing is also more comfortable than com-plete packing, although the patient will still experience asensation that something is in the nasal cavity. Thepatient must be instructed not to interfere with or probethe packing while it is in place.\\nA postnasal pack is used to treat bleeding in the\\npostnasal area. This is difficult area to pack. Packs usedin this area are made from cotton balls or gauze that havebeen tied into a tubular shape with heavy gauge suture orumbilical tape. Long lengths of suture or tape are leftfree. The lengths of suture or tape are used to help posi-tion the pack during installation and to remove it. Analternative is to cut a vaginal tampon and reposition thestrings. Balloons have been tried as a method to replacepostnasal packing, but have not proved effective. Afterbeing tied, the pack is soaked with an antibiotic oint-ment. Generally, packs are formed larger than needed, sothat they completely block the nasal passage. A catheteris passed through the nose and pulled out through themouth. Strings from one end of the pack are tied to thecatheter and the pack pulled into place by passingthrough the mouth and up the back of the nasal cavity.The pack is removed in a similar manner. Complicationsmay occur if a pack compresses the Eustachian tube,\\ncausing ear problems. The ear should be examined toensure that infection is not developing.\\nPacking of the anterior (front) part of the nose is also\\nperformed following surgery such as septoplasty and\\nrhinoplasty . In these operations, the surgeon cuts\\nthrough the skin flap covering cartilage and bone in thecenter, top, and bottom of the nose to correct the shape ofthe nose. At the conclusion of the surgery, the skin flap issutured back into place. The purposes of packing is toabsorb any drainage from the incision and mucus pro-duced by nasal tissue, and to support the skin flap andcartilage. The packing used is either gauze or preformedadsorbent wedges of cotton. Both are usually treatedwith antibiotic to reduce the chance of infections at theincision site. Generally, there is little bleeding followingseptoplasty and rhinoplasty, and the incisions heal nor-mally. These packs are left in place for 24 to 48 hoursand then removed.\\nAftercare\\nIce chips or mouthwash can be used to moisten the\\nmouth while packing is in place, as the mouth may bedry from breathing through it. Humidifiers may also helpwith breathing. After nasal packing, the nose should notbe blown for two to three days.\\nSince one of the major reasons that packing is per-\\nformed is to heal damage to nasal blood vessels fromnose-picking, follow-up examination should be done toensure that the patient is no longer practicing this habit.If the patient has restarted nose-picking, therapy to alterthis behavior should be pursued. When the packing com-pletely blocks the nasal cavity and prevents breathingthrough the nose, the patient should adjust to breathingthrough the mouth. In elderly patients, adjustment maybe more difficult. This leads to a drop in the blood oxy-gen content and an increase in blood carbon dioxide lev-els (CO\\n2). This, in turn, can cause respiratory and cardiac\\ncomplications, including a racing pulse.\\nRisks\\nNasal packing could cause a lack of oxygen in those\\nwho have difficulty breathing through their mouths.Rarely, sinus infection or middle ear infection may occur.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBluestone, C.

By far the most common arepolyps, which have smooth surfaces. On the contrary,papillomas have irregular surfaces and are, in fact, warts.Papillomas may be caused by the same viruses that causewarts elsewhere on the body. They are inside the nose,more often on the side near the cheek, and, because oftheir internal structure, they are much more likely tobleed than polyps.\\nThere is a special type of nasal papilloma called an\\ninverting papilloma because of its unique appearance.About 10 or 15% of these are or can become cancers.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nLike polyps, papillomas can plug up the nose and\\ndisable the sense of smell. Unlike polyps, papillomasoften bleed.\\nDiagnosis\\nA physical examination with special instruments\\nwill detect these tumors.\\nTreatment\\nBecause of the possibility of cancer , all nasal papil-\\nlomas must be removed surgically and sent to the labora-KEY TERMS\\nTurbinate —Ridge-shaped cartilage or soft bony\\ntissue inside the nose.\\nUlcer —A sore on the skin or mucous tissue that\\nproduces pus and in which tissue is destroyed.KEY TERMS\\nPolyp —A tumor commonly found in the nasal\\ncavity or intestine.\\ntory for analysis. If a cancer is present, further surgery\\nmay be necessary to guarantee that all of the cancer hasbeen removed. The initial surgery can be done in anoffice setting by a specialist in head and neck surgery,also known as otorhinolaryngology and popularly abbre-viated ENT (ear, nose, and throat). Cancer surgery ismore extensive and often requires hospitalization.\\nPrognosis\\nFor benign (non-cancerous) lesions, removal is cura-\\ntive, although they tend to recur, just like warts elsewhere.The cancerous papillomas may occasionally escape com-plete surgical removal and spread to adjacent or distantsites. The prognosis is then much more complex.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBallenger, John Jacob. Disorders of the Nose, Throat, Ear,\\nHead, and Neck.

Pseu-doephedrine, phenylephrine, and phenylpropano-lamine are the most common.\\nSinus —Air-filled cavities surrounding the eyes and\\nnose are lined with mucus-producing membranes.They cleanse the nose, add resonance to the voice,and partially determine the structure of the face.\\nSinuses are lined with mucus membranes, just like the\\nnose. Polyps can easily obstruct the drainage of mucusfrom the sinuses. When any fluid in the body is trappedso it cannot flow freely, it becomes infected. The result,sinusitis , is a common complication of allergic rhinitis .\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSome people who are allergic to aspirin develop\\nboth asthma and nasal polyps.\\nNasal polyps often plug the nose, usually one side at\\na time. People with allergic rhinitis are so used to havinga stopped up nose they may not notice the differencewhen a polyp develops. Other polyps may be closer to asinus opening, so airflow is not obstructed, but mucusbecomes trapped in the sinus. In this case, there is a feel-ing of fullness in the head, no sense of smell, and per-haps a headache . The trapped mucus will eventually get\\ninfected, adding pain , fever, and perhaps bloody dis-\\ncharge from the nose.\\nDiagnosis\\nA physical examination will identify most polyps.\\nSmall polyps located higher up or further back may behidden from view, but they will be detected with moresophisticated medical instruments. The otorhinolaryngol-ogist is equipped to diagnose nasal polyps. In order toperform the exam, medicine must be applied to decon-gest the membranes. Cotton balls soaked with one ofthese agents and left in the nostrils for a few minutes pro-vide adequate shrinkage.\\nTreatment\\nMost polyps can be removed by the head and neck\\nsurgeon as an office procedure called a nasal polypecto-my. Bleeding, the only complication, is usually easy to\\ncontrol. Nose and sinus infections can be treated withantibiotics and decongestants , but if airflow is restrict-\\ned, the infection will reoccur.\\nPrognosis\\nPolyps reappear as long as the allergic irritation con-\\ntinues.\\nPrevention\\nIf aspirin is the cause, all aspirin containing medica-\\ntions must be avoided.\\nSince most nasal polyps are the result of allergic\\nrhinitis, they can be prevented by treating this condition.New treatments have greatly improved control of hayfever. There are now several spray medicines that arequite effective. Spray cortisone-like drugs are the mostpopular. Over-the-counter nasal decongestants have anirritating effect similar to the allergy they are supposed tobe treating. Continued use can bring more trouble thanrelief and result in an addiction to nose sprays. The\\nresulting disease, rhinitis medicamentosa, is more diffi-cult to treat than allergic rhinitis.\\nAllergists and ENT surgeons both treat allergic\\nrhinitis with a procedure called desensitization. Afteridentifying suspect allergens using one of several meth-ods, they will give the patient increasing doses of thoseallergens in order to produce blocking antibodies thatwill impede the allergic reaction. This is effective in anumber of patients, but the treatment may take a periodof months to years.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2316Nasal polyps\\nA nasal polyp inside patient’s right nostril.

Stamford: Appleton & Lange, 1995.\\nJ. Ricker Polsdorfer, MD\\nNasal trauma\\nDefinition\\nNasal trauma is defined as any injury to the nose or\\nrelated structure that may result in deformity, decreasedinhalation due to obstruction, or an impaired sense ofsmell (olfaction).\\nDescription\\nThe nose is composed of bone, soft tissue, and carti-\\nlage. It functions to serve as a passageway for air fromthe environment to flow into the lower respiratory tractand lungs, at the same time warming and humidify air.\\nThe nasal bones are the most frequently fractured\\nfacial bones due to their foremost position on the face.Although not life threatening, fractures may lead to aes-\\nthetic and functional deformities. Children have a morecartilaginous nose than adults and are more resilient totrauma due to force.\\nFractures of the nose vary with the type and direc-\\ntion of force that has been inflicted. Fractures resultingfrom trauma to the nose may involve the bones of theseptum as well as bones surrounding the orbit includingthe nasal, maxilla, lacrimal, and frontal bones. Fracturesand other trauma may also damage the membranes thatline the nasal passages. Damage to these membranes isserious since it can lead to obstruction, increased secre-tion, or an impaired sense of olfaction.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nNasal trauma results from fractures, dislocations,\\nforeign bodies such as digits, chemical irritants, burns ;\\nor may be iatrogenic in which complications of aphysician’s exam or surgical treatment result in injury.Most injuries are caused by auto accidents, sports\\ninjuries , fights, work related accidents, or leisure\\nactivities. Falls are a more common cause of nasalinjury in children. Trauma can also occur to neonatesas a result of birth. There is also an increased incidenceof fractures following rhinoplasty , or plastic surgery,\\nperformed on the nose.\\nAll severe blows to the nose may result in a nasal\\nfracture. After such a blow, the nose may appear slightlydeformed as well as shifted laterally or depressed. Othersymptoms include:\\n•pain\\n• swelling• airway obstruction• epistaxis (profuse bleeding from the nose)\\n• crepitance (the crackling heard and the sensation felt\\nwhen broken bones are moved over each other)\\n• ecchymosis (a purplish area of the nose resulting from\\nfracture and caused by extravasation of blood into theskin)\\n• septal hematoma (a mass of extravasated blood that\\nconfined within the nasal septum)\\n•rhinitis (an inflammation of the mucous membranes\\nthat line the nasal passages)\\n• nasal vestibular stenosis (a narrowing of the nasal pas-\\nsages)\\nIn addition to fracture, trauma may be caused by\\nchemical inhalation. This is normally due to repetitiveinhalation of toxic materials that may, in addition to irri-tating the nasal passages, cause damage to the lower res-piratory tract and lungs. Irritant gases may cause damageby direct contact with membranes and a proceedingchemical reaction can result in a release of free radicalscausing membrane damage.\\nInitial symptoms of chemical irritation may include\\nrhinorrhea or runny nose, pain, and/or nasal congestion.Certain chemical irritants may also cause burning of themucous membranes of the nose. Irritation may also causeredness of the eyes, coughing, sneezing, itching , and a\\ndeficit in olfaction and taste.\\nSome common irritants that may be encountered in\\nthe home and workplace include:\\n• cleaning solutions and powders\\n• ammonia• environmental tobacco smoke• bleach\\n• metalworking fluids\\n• ozone• sulfur dioxide\\n• paint thinners\\n• arsenic\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2317Nasal trauma'),\n",

Reactions varyamong persons, even with similar exposures.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of a fracture is normally based on a histo-\\nry of nasal trauma and clinical presentation. Epistaxismay or may not be present. An intranasal examination isperformed in order to look for a septal hematoma thatmay result in serious consequences such as death of the\\nseptal cartilaginous tissue. The nose is also checked fortenderness, mobility, stability, and crepitance.\\nX rays are normally not indicated, however, in more\\nsevere fractures involving multiple bones a computedtomography (CT) scan may be required. The physicianshould look for associated injuries such as periorbital (sur-rounding the eye) ecchymosis, watery eyes, or diplopia(double vision) that may indicate orbital injuries. In addi-tion, dental fractures and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakshould be looked for. CSF leaks indicate a more severeinjury possibly involving an ethmoid bone fracture.\\nThe physician may also ask for photographs taken\\nprior to the injury in order to determine the extent ofdeformity. Photographs may also be taken to documentthe injury in regards to possible legal actions.\\nIn order to diagnose trauma sustained by a chemical\\ninjury, a history of exposure to potentially toxic chemicalsshould be ascertained. In addition, the patient should alsobring information related to the types of chemicals that heor she has been exposed to. If injury occurs in the work-place, Material Safety Data Sheets should be available inthe employer’s poison control center that list the chemicalcomponents of commercial materials. Measurements of air\\nfrom the patient’s work area may also be obtained. Symp-tomatic improvement on off-days followed by a subsequentreturn of symptoms when returning to work confirms thatthe illness is work related. The physician should perform anintranasal examination to determine the extent of the chem-ical injury. A chest x ray as well as a pulmonary function\\ntestmay be ordered to determine if there is any subsequent\\nlower respiratory tract involvement.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of nasal fractures is aimed at restoring\\nnasal function and reestablishing the aesthetic appearanceof the nose. Treatment is best performed during the firstthree hours after the injury. If this is impossible, manage-ment of a nasal fracture should be done within three toseven days. Timing is of utmost importance when treatingnasal fractures since delays longer than seven to 10 daysmay result in significant bone healing and possiblyrequire surgical intervention including rhinoplasty.\\nThe treatment options depend upon the extent of the\\ninjury. Reductions, or restorations, can be performed underlocal or general anesthesia. A closed reduction involvesmanipulation without a skin incision. This type of reduc-tion will be performed for unilateral or bilateral fractures ofthe nasal bones, or if the fracture of the nasal-septal com-plex is insignificant. If there is a persistent deformity fol-lowing treatment an open reduction may be needed.\\nOpen reductions are performed for more complex\\nnasal fractures. This involves manipulating the bonesback to their original location after an incision in the skinhas been made. This procedure is done for fracturesinvolving dislocation of the nasal bones and the septum.In addition, an open reduction is indicated for a septalhematoma or for open fractures in which the skin hasbeen perforated. If a septal hematoma is present, itshould be drained and packed to prevent subsequentaccumulation of blood. The patient should be givenantibiotics and may be referred to an otolaryngologist or\\na plastic surgeon for further evaluation.\\nComplications can arise following treatment and\\ntherefore follow-up is necessary. Problems that mayoccur resemble symptoms of nasal fractures. Othersinclude infection, CSF leakage, scar tissue build-up, anda saddle nose deformity where the bridge of the nose ismarkedly depressed.\\nTreatment for trauma caused by irritant inhalation\\ninvolves removing the patient from the contaminated areaor decreasing exposure time. Other measures includeusing a saline nasal spray or topical steroids. For acuteinjuries oxygen or supportive treatment for any subsequentlower respiratory tract involvement may be administered.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2318Nasal trauma\\nFractured nose of an elderly patient.

Jones, PhD\\nNative American health seeMinority health\\nNaturopathic medicine\\nDefinition\\nNaturopathic medicine is a branch of medicine in\\nwhich a variety of natural medicines and treatments areused to heal illness. It uses a system of medical diagnosisand therapeutics based on the patterns of chaos and orga-nization in nature. It is founded on the premise that peopleare naturally healthy, and that healing can occur throughremoving obstacles to a cure and by stimulating the body’snatural healing abilities. The foundations of health in nat-ural medicine are diet, nutrition ,homeopathy , physical\\nmanipulation, stress management, and exercise .\\nNaturopaths are general practitioners who treat a\\nwide variety of illnesses. They believe in treating the“whole person”—the spirit as well as the physicalbody—and emphasize preventive care. They often rec-ommend changes in diet and lifestyle to enhance thehealth of their patients.\\nPurpose\\nNaturopathic medicine is useful for treating chronic\\nas well as acute diseases. It is sometimes used in con-junction with allopathic care to enhance wellness andrelieve chronic symptoms, such as fatigue and pain . A\\nnaturopath treats a wide range of health problems, rang-ing from back pain to depression.\\nA naturopathic physician will spend extra time inter-\\nviewing and examining the patient to find the underlyingcause for a medical problem. Emotional and spiritualsymptoms and patterns are included in the assessment. Thenaturopath often spends more time educating patients inpreventive health, lifestyle, and nutrition than most M.D.s.\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nPeople have always seen a connection to diet and\\ndisease, and many therapies are built around specialdiets . Naturopathy began in the eighteenth and nine-\\nteenth centuries, as the industrial revolution broughtabout unhealthy lifestyles, and the European custom of“taking the cure” at natural spas became popular. Bene-dict Lust, who believed deeply in natural medicine, orga-nized naturopathy as a formal system of healthcare in the1890s. By the early 1900s, it was flourishing.\\nThe first naturopaths in the United States emphasized\\nthe healing properties of a nutritious diet, as did a numberof their contemporaries. In the early twentieth century, forinstance, John Kellogg, a physician and vegetarian,opened a sanitarium which used healing methods such ashydrotherapy , often prescribed by today’s naturopaths.\\nHis brother Will produced health foods, such as cornflakes and shredded wheat. The Post brothers helped makenaturopathic ideas popular and emphasized the value ofwhole grains over highly refined ones. Together with oneof their employees, C.W. Post, they eventually went on tostart the cereal companies that bear their names.\\nIn the early 1900s, most states licensed naturopaths as\\nphysicians. There were 20 medical schools of naturopathicmedicine. From early on, naturopathic physicians wereconsidered “eclectic,” since they drew on a variety of nat-ural therapies and traditions for treating their patients.\\nIn the 1930s, naturopathy dramatically declined for\\nseveral reasons. Allopathic medicine finally stoppedusing therapies such as bloodletting and heavy metal\\npoisoning as curatives. New therapies were more effec-\\ntive and less toxic. Allopathic medical schools becameincreasingly well-funded by foundations with links to theemerging drug industry. Also, allopathic physiciansbecame much more organized and wielded politicalclout. Naturopathy has experienced a resurgence over thelast 20 years, however. The lay public is aware of theconnection between a healthy diet and lifestyle andavoiding chronic disease. In addition, conventional medi-cine is often unable to treat these chronic diseases.Patients are now health care consumers, and will seektheir own resolution to health problems that cannot beresolved by conventional physicians. As a result, evenmedical groups which once considered naturopathy inef-fective are now beginning to accept it.\\nNaturopathic medicine modalities include a variety\\nof healing treatments, such as diet and clinical nutrition,homeopathy, botanical medicine, soft tissue and spinalmanipulation, ultrasound, and therapeutic exercise. Anaturopath provides complete diagnostic and treatmentservices in sciences such as obstetrics, pediatrics andobstetrics. Some are also licensed midwives.\\nNaturopaths consider health to be not just the\\nabsence of disease, but complete physical, mental andsocial well being. Naturopathic physicians often say that\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2322Naturopathic medicine'),\n",

Symptoms areactually viewed as the body’s natural efforts to heal itselfand restore balance.\\nA typical office visit to a naturopath takes an hour.\\nDuring the first visit, the doctor will ask detailed ques-tions about the patient’s symptoms, lifestyle, history ofillness, and state of his or her emotions. The naturopathwill take a complete medical history, and may order labtests such as urine and blood tests. A naturopath may talkwith the patient about the possible causes for an illness—poor diet, life stresses, occupational dangers, and mental,emotional, and spiritual problems. Naturopaths believethat even widely varying symptoms can sometimes betraced to one underlying cause. Often environmental ormetabolic toxins or serious stress bring on an illness.\\nIn some states, naturopaths prescribe pharmaceuti-\\ncals. In these cases, naturopaths might prescribe naturalmedicines, such as natural hormones, glandular thyroid\\nhormones , herbal extracts, vitamins , etc.\\nAs with most doctors, treatment by a naturopath can\\nrange from one office visit to many. Some acute illnessescan be alleviated with one or two visits. Other chronicdiseases need regular weekly or monthly attention. Clini-cal care provided by naturopathic physicians are coveredby insurance in a number of states in the United States.\\nPreparations\\nThere are about 3,000 naturopathic physicians in the\\nUnited States. Consumers can find naturopaths by contact-ing the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians(AANP) or logging on to their Web site. Naturopaths rec-ommended by the AANP have met requirements for statelicensure and have taken a national exam that qualifiesthem to practice. Qualified naturopaths can also be foundthrough the local branch of the national or state associa-tion of naturopathic physicians. It is sometimes useful torequest names from another health care provider whoknows naturopathic practitioners in the community.\\nPrecautions\\nA good naturopath is always willing to work with\\nthe patient’s other physicians or health care providers. Toavoid drug interactions and to coordinate care, it isimportant for a patient to inform his or her allopathicdoctor about supplements prescribed by a naturopath.\\nMany naturopaths give childhood vaccinations, but\\nsome do not. If a parent is concerned about this, it is bestto go to an allopathic doctor for vaccinations.\\nNaturopaths are not licensed to perform major\\nsurgery, or prescribe narcotics and antidepressantdrugs . They must involve an oncologist when treating a\\ncancer patient.\\nSide effects\\nAlthough naturopathic remedies are from natural\\nsources and pose much less risk than traditional drugsdo, there are some side effects with the use of some. Oneproblem they can pose is the interaction with prescriptionmedicines. It is important for a patient to inform his orher allopathic physician about any natural remedies orherbs prescribed by a naturopath.\\nIt is also important to note that the U.S. Food and\\nDrug Administration considers medicinal herbs asdietary supplements, not drugs, and so are not subject tothe same regulations as drugs are. Because they comefrom natural sources, the active ingredients may notalways be in the same concentration from bottle to bottle,since plants naturally vary. To guard against using too lit-tle or too much of a natural remedy, use herbs and sup-plements recommended by a naturopath or those pro-duced by well-respected companies.\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nMedical research in naturopathy has increased dra-\\nmatically in the United States within the last 10 years.Naturopathic research often employs case histories, sum-maries of practitioners’ clinical observations, and med-ical records. Some U.S. studies have also met today’s sci-entific gold standard; they were double-blind and place-bo-controlled. Much naturopathic research has also beendone in Germany, France, England, India, and China.\\nResearch in naturopathy tends to focus on single\\ntreatments used by naturopaths, rather than naturopathyas a whole. In 1998, an extensive review of such singletreatment studies found that naturopathic healing meth-ods were effective for 15 different medical conditions,including osteoarthritis ,asthma , and middle ear infec-\\ntions. A study of 8,341 men in with damaged heart mus-cles in 1996 revealed that supplementation with niacin, aB vitamin, was associated with an 11% reduced risk ofmortality over 15 years. In 1996, a study showed St.\\nJohn’s wort was as effective as prescription antidepres-\\nsants in relieving depression, and had fewer side effects.\\nStudies have also demonstrated benefits in the arena\\nof women’s health issues. In one classic 1993 study,\\nwomen with cervical dysplasia or abnormal Pap smearswere treated by naturopaths with topical applications ofherbs and dietary supplements. These medicationsincluded Bromelian, an enzyme from the pineapple;bloodroot; marigold; and zinc chloride; and suppositoriesmade from herbal and nutritional ingredients, such as\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2323Naturopathic medicine'),\n",

Thirty eight of the\\n43 women in the study had normal Pap smears and nor-mal tissue biopsies after treatment. The study concludedthat these protocols might benefit the health of patientsundergoing more traditional treatments for cervical dys-plasia, such as cryosurgery.\\nOther more recent research has documented the ben-\\nefits of nutritional foods such as soy in relieving hotflashes and vaginal dryness. Nutritional supplements pre-scribed by naturopaths to enhance women’s health dur-ing menopause have also proven effective. Research\\nshows vitamin E supplements are helpful for 50% ofpostmenopausal women with thinning vaginal tissue.Studies also reveal that bioflavonoids with vitamin C andgamma-oryzanol, a substance taken from rice bran oil,can relieve hot flashes.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBetter Homes and Gardens.

The typical victim is young and male.Nearly half of all drownings and near-drownings involvechildren less than four years old. Home swimming poolspose the greatest risk for children, being the site of60–90% of drownings in the 0–4 age group. Teenage boysalso face a heightened risk of drowning and near-drown-ing, largely because of their tendency to behave recklesslyand use drugs and alcohol (drugs and alcohol are implicat-ed in 40–50% of teenage drownings). Males, however,predominate even in the earliest age-groups, possiblybecause young boys are often granted more freedom fromsupervision than young girls enjoy, making it more likelythat they will stumble into danger and less likely that they\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2326Near-drowning'),\n",

Near-drownings, moreover, can occur in shallow aswell as deep water. Small children have drowned or almostdrowned in bathtubs, toilets, industrial-size cleaning buck-ets, and washing machines. Bathtubs are especially dan-gerous for infants six months to one year old, who can situp straight in a bathtub but may lack the ability to pullthemselves out of the water if they slip under the surface.\\nA reduced concentration of oxygen in the blood\\n(hypoxemia) is common to all near-drownings. Humanlife, of course, depends on a constant supply of oxygen-laden air reaching the blood by way of the lungs. Whendrowning begins, the larynx (an air passage) closes invol-untarily, preventing both air and water from entering thelungs. In 10–15% of cases, hypoxemia results because thelarynx stays closed. This is called “dry drowning.” Hypox-emia also occurs in “wet drowning,” the 85–90% of caseswhere the larynx relaxes and water enters the lungs. Thephysiological mechanisms that produce hypoxemia in wetdrowning are different for freshwater and saltwater, butonly a small amount of either kind of water is needed todamage the lungs and interfere with the body’s oxygenintake. All of this happens very quickly: within three min-utes of submersion most people are unconscious, andwithin five minutes the brain begins to suffer from lack ofoxygen. Abnormal heart rhythms (cardiac dysrhythmias)often occur in near-drowning cases, and the heart may stoppumping (cardiac arrest). An increase in blood acidity(acidosis) is another consequence of near-drowning, andunder some circumstances near-drowning can cause a sub-stantial increase or decrease in the volume of circulatingblood. Many victims experience a severe drop in bodytemperature ( hypothermia ).\\nThe signs and symptoms of near-drowning can differ\\nwidely from person to person. Some victims are alert butagitated, while others are comatose. Breathing may havestopped, or the victim may be gasping for breath. Bluishskin ( cyanosis ), coughing, and frothy pink sputum (mate-\\nrial expelled from the respiratory tract by coughing) areoften observed. Rapid breathing (tachypnea), a rapidheart rate (tachycardia), and a low-grade fever are com-\\nmon during the first few hours after rescue. Consciousvictims may appear confused, lethargic, or irritable.Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis relies on a physical examination of the\\nvictim and on a wide range of tests and other procedures.Blood is taken to measure oxygen levels and for manyother purposes. Pulse oximetry, another way of assessingoxygen levels, involves attaching a device called a pulseoximeter to the patient’s finger. An electrocardiograph isused to monitor heart activity. X rays can detect head andneck injuries and excess tissue fluid ( edema ) in the lungs.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment begins with removing the victim from the\\nwater and performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation\\n(CPR ). One purpose of CPR—which, of course, should\\nbe attempted only by people trained in its use—is to bringoxygen to the lungs, heart, brain, and other organs bybreathing into the victim’s mouth. When the victim’s hearthas stopped, CPR also attempts to get the heart pumpingagain by pressing down on the victim’s chest. After CPRhas been performed and emergency medical help hasarrived on the scene, oxygen is administered to the victim.If the victim’s breathing has stopped or is otherwiseimpaired, a tube is inserted into the windpipe (trachea) tomaintain the airway (this is called endotracheal intuba-tion). The victim is also checked for head, neck, and otherinjuries, and fluids are given intravenously. Hypothermiacases require careful handling to protect the heart.\\nIn the emergency department, victims continue\\nreceiving oxygen until blood tests show a return to nor-mal. About one-third are intubated and initially needmechanical support to breathe. Rewarming is undertakenwhen hypothermia is present. Victims may arrive need-ing treatment for cardiac arrest or cardiac dysrhythmias.Comatose patients present a special problem: althoughvarious treatment approaches have been tried, none haveproved beneficial. Patients can be discharged from theemergency department after four to six hours if theirblood oxygen level is normal and no signs or symptomsof near-drowning are present. But because lung problemscan arise 12 or more hours after submersion, the medicalstaff must first be satisfied that the patients are willingand able to seek further medical help if necessary.Admission to a hospital for at least 24 hours for furtherobservation and treatment is a must for patients who donot appear to recover fully in the emergency department.\\nPrognosis\\nNeurological damage is the major long-term concern\\nin the treatment of near-drowning victims. Patients whoarrive at an emergency department awake and alert usual-ly survive with brain function intact, as do about 90% ofthose who arrive mentally impaired (lethargic, confused,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2327Near-drowning'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 34}, page_content='and so forth) but not comatose. Death or permanent neu-\\nrological damage is very likely when patients arrivecomatose. Early rescue of near-drowning victims (withinfive minutes of submersion) and prompt CPR (within lessthan 10 minutes of submersion) seem to be the best guar-antees of a complete recovery. An analysis of 715 patientsadmitted to emergency departments in 1971–81 revealedthat 69% recovered completely, 25% died, and 6% sur-vived but suffered permanent neurological damage.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention depends on educating parents, other\\nadults, and teenagers about water safety.\\nParents must realize that young children who are left\\nin or near water without adult supervision even for ashort time can easily get into trouble, not just at thebeach or next to a swimming pool, but in bathtubs andaround toilets, buckets, washing machines, and otherhousehold articles where water can collect. Research onswimming pool drownings involving young childrenshows that the victims have usually been left unattendedless than five minutes before the accident. Experts con-sider putting up a fence around a home swimming poolan essential precaution, and estimate that 50-90% ofchild drownings and near-drownings could be preventedif fences were widely adopted. The fence should be atleast five feet high and unclimbable, have a self-closingand self-locking gate, and completely surround the pool.\\nPool owners—and, indeed, all other adults—should\\nconsider learning CPR. Everyone, of course, should fol-low the rules for safe swimming and boating. Those whohave a medical condition that can cause a seizure or oth-erwise threaten safety in the water are advised always toswim with a partner. And of course, people need to beaware that alcohol and drug use substantially increase thechances of an accident.\\nThe danger of alcohol and drug use around water is\\na point that requires special emphasis where teenagersare concerned. Teenagers can also benefit from CPRtraining and safe swimming and boating classes.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nModell, Jerome H. “Drowning and Near-Drowning.” In Harri-\\nson’s Principles of Internal Medicine , ed.

It can cause the death (necrosis) of intesti-\\nnal tissue and progress to blood poisoning (septicemia).\\nDescription\\nNecrotizing enterocolitis develops in approximately\\n10% of newborns weighing less than 800 g (under 2 lb).It is a serious infection that can produce complications inthe intestine itself—such as ulcers, perforations (holes)in the intestinal wall, and tissue necrosis—as well asprogress to life-threatening septicemia. Necrotizing ente-rocolitis most commonly affects the lower portion of thesmall intestine (ileum). It is less common in the colonand upper small bowel.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of necrotizing enterocolitis is not clear. It\\nis believed that the infection usually develops after thebowel wall has already been weakened or damaged by alack of oxygen, predisposing it to bacterial invasion. Bac-teria proliferate in the bowel and cause a deep infectionthat can kill bowel tissue and spread to the bloodstream.\\nNecrotizing enterocolitis almost always occurs in\\nthe first month of life. Infants who require tube feedings\\nmay have an increased risk for the disorder. A number ofother conditions also make newborns susceptible, includ-ing respiratory distress syndrome , congenital heart\\nproblems, and episodes of apnea (cessation of breathing).The primary risk factor, however, is prematurity . Not\\nonly is the immature digestive tract less able to protectitself, but premature infants are subjected to many stress-es on the body in their attempt to survive.\\nEarly symptoms of necrotizing enterocolitis include\\nan intolerance to formula, distended and tenderabdomen, vomiting, and blood (visible or not) in the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2328Necrotizing enterocolitis'),\n",

One of the earliest signs may also be the need for\\nmechanical support of the infant’s breathing. If the infec-tion spreads to the bloodstream, infants may developlethargy, fluctuations in body temperature, and periodi-cally stop breathing.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe key to reducing the complications of this dis-\\nease is early suspicion by the physician. A series of xrays of the bowel often reveals the progressive condition,and blood tests confirm infection.\\nTreatment\\nOver two-thirds of infants can be treated without\\nsurgery. Aggressive medical therapy is begun as soon asthe condition is diagnosed or even suspected. Tube feed-ings into the gastrointestinal tract (enteral nutrition ) are\\ndiscontinued, and tube feedings into the veins (parenteralnutrition) are used instead until the condition hasresolved. Intravenous fluids are given for several weekswhile the bowel heals.\\nSome infants are placed on a ventilator to help them\\nbreathe, and some receive transfusions of platelets, whichhelp the blood clot when there is internal bleeding.Antibiotics are usually given intravenously for at least 10\\ndays. These infants require frequent evaluations by thephysician, who may order multiple abdominal x rays andblood tests to monitor their condition during the illness.\\nSometimes, necrotizing enterocolitis must be treated\\nwith surgery. This is often the case when an infant’s con-dition does not improve with medical therapy or there aresigns of worsening infection.\\nThe surgical treatment depends on the individual\\npatient’s condition. Patients with infection that hascaused serious damage to the bowel may have portions ofthe bowel removed. It is sometimes necessary to create asubstitute bowel by making an opening ( ostomy ) into the\\nabdomen through the skin, from which waste productsare discharged temporarily. But many physicians areavoiding this and operating to remove diseased boweland repair the defect at the same time.\\nPostoperative complications are common, including\\nwound infections and lack of healing, persistent sepsis\\nand bowel necrosis, and a serious internal bleeding disor-der known as disseminated intravascular coagulation.\\nPrognosis\\nNecrotizing enterocolitis is the most common cause\\nof death in newborns undergoing surgery. The averagemortality is 30–40%, even higher in severe cases.KEY TERMS\\nEnteral nutrition —Liquid nutrition provided\\nthrough tubes that enter the gastrointestinal tract,usually through the mouth or nose.\\nNecrosis —The death of cells, a portion of tissue,\\nor a portion of an organ due to permanent damageof some sort, such as a lack of oxygen supply tothe tissues.\\nParenteral nutrition —Liquid nutrition provided\\nthrough tubes that are placed in the veins.\\nSepsis —The presence of pus-forming or other dis-\\nease-causing organisms in the blood or tissues.Septicemia, commonly known as blood poison-ing, is a common type of sepsis.\\nEarly identification and treatment are critical to\\nimproving the outcome for these infants. Aggressivenonsurgical support and careful timing of surgical inter-vention have improved overall survival; however, thiscondition can be fatal in about one-third of cases. Withthe resolution of the infection, the bowel may begin func-tioning within weeks or months. But infants need to becarefully monitored by a physician for years because ofpossible future complications.\\nAbout 10–35% of all survivors will eventually\\ndevelop a stricture, or narrowing, of the intestine thatoccurs with healing. This can create an intestinalobstruction that will require surgery. Infants may alsobe more susceptible to future bacterial infections inthe gastrointestinal tract and to a delay in growth.Infants with severe cases may also suffer neurologicalimpairment.\\nThe most serious long-term gastrointestinal compli-\\ncation associated with necrotizing enterocolitis is short-bowel, or short-gut, syndrome. This refers to a conditionthat can develop when a large amount of bowel must beremoved, making the intestines less able to absorb cer-tain nutrients and enzymes. These infants graduallyevolve from tube feedings to oral feedings, and medica-tions are used to control the malabsorption, diarrhea ,\\nand other consequences of this condition.\\nPrevention\\nIn very small or sick premature infants, the risk for\\nnecrotizing enterocolitis may be diminished by begin-ning parenteral nutrition and delaying enteral feedingsfor several days to weeks.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2329Necrotizing enterocolitis'),\n",

Biliru-bin is a by-product of the breakdown of red blood cells.This condition can cause a yellow discoloration of theskin and the whites of the eyes called jaundice.\\nDescription\\nBilirubin, a by-product of the breakdown of hemo-\\nglobin (the oxygen-carrying substance in red bloodcells), is produced when the body breaks down old redblood cells. Normally, the liver processes the bilirubinand excretes it in the stool. Hyperbilirubinemia meansthere is a high level of bilirubin in the blood. This con-dition is particularly common in newborn infants.Before birth, an infant gets rid of bilirubin through themother’s blood and liver systems. After birth, thebaby’s liver has to take over processing bilirubin on itsown. Almost all newborns have higher than normal lev-els of bilirubin. In most cases, the baby’s systems con-tinue to develop and can soon process bilirubin. How-ever, some infants may need medical treatment to pre-vent serious complications which can occur due to theaccumulation of bilirubin.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn newborn infants, the liver and intestinal systems\\nare immature and cannot excrete bilirubin as fast as thebody produces it. This type of hyperbilirubinemia cancause jaundice to develop within a few days after birth.About one-half of all newborns develop jaundice, whilepremature infants are much more likely to develop it.Hyperbilirubinemia is also more common in some popu-lations, such as Native American and Asian. All infantswith jaundice should be evaluated by a health careprovider to rule out more serious problems.\\nHyperbilirubinemia and jaundice can also be the\\nresult of other diseases or conditions. Hepatitis, cirrhosis\\nof the liver, and mononucleosis are diseases that canaffect the liver. Gallstones , a blocked bile duct, or the\\nuse of drugs or alcohol can also cause jaundice.\\nExtremely high levels of bilirubin in infants may\\ncause kernicterus, a form of brain damage. Signs ofsevere hyperbilirubinemia include listlessness, high-pitched crying, apnea (periods of not breathing), archingof the back, and seizures. If severe hyperbilirubinemia isnot treated, it can cause mental retardation ,hearing\\nloss, behavior disorders, cerebral palsy , or death .\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2330Neonatal jaundice'),\n",

It is also used to remove ahealthy kidney from a donor for the purposes of kidney\\ntransplantation .\\nPrecautions\\nBecause the kidney is responsible for filtering\\nwastes and fluid from the bloodstream, kidney functionis critical to life. Nephrectomy candidates suffering fromserious kidney disease, cancer, or infection usually havefew treatment choices but to undergo the procedure.However, if kidney function is lost in the remaining kid-ney, the patient will require chronic dialysis treatments ortransplantation of a healthy kidney to sustain life.\\nDescription\\nNephrectomy may involve removing a small portion\\nof the kidney or the entire organ and surrounding tissues.In partial nephrectomy, only the diseased or infected por-tion of the kidney is removed. Radical nephrectomyinvolves removing the entire kidney, a section of the tubeleading to the bladder (ureter), the gland that sits atop thekidney (adrenal gland), and the fatty tissue surroundingthe kidney. A simple nephrectomy performed for trans-plant purposes requires removal of the kidney and a sec-tion of the attached ureter. A similar procedure is used toharvest cadaver kidneys, although both kidneys are typi-cally removed at once (bilateral nephrectomy) and bloodand cell samples for tissue typing are also taken.The nephrectomy patient is administered general anes-\\nthesia and the surgeon makes an incision on the side orfront of the abdomen. Muscle, fat, and tissue are cut awayto reveal the kidney. The blood vessels connecting the kid-ney to the circulation are cut and clamped. Depending onthe type of nephrectomy procedure being performed, theureter, adrenal gland, and/or surrounding tissue may alsobe cut. The vessels and the ureter in the patient are then tiedoff and the incision is sewn up (sutured). The surgical pro-cedure can take up to three hours, depending on the type ofnephrectomy being performed.\\nLaparoscopic nephrectomy is a form of minimally-\\ninvasive surgery that utilizes instruments on long, narrowrods to view, cut, and remove the kidney. The surgeonviews the kidney and surrounding tissue with a flexiblevideoscope. The videoscope and surgical instruments aremaneuvered through four small incisions in theabdomen. Once the kidney is freed, it is secured in a bagand pulled through a fifth incision, approximately 3 in(7.6 cm) wide, in the front of the abdominal wall belowthe navel. Although this surgical technique takes slightlylonger than a traditional nephrectomy, preliminary stud-ies have shown that it promotes a faster recovery time,shorter hospital stays, and less post-operative pain for\\nkidney donors.\\nPreparation\\nPrior to surgery, blood samples will be taken from\\nthe patient to type and crossmatch in case transfusion is\\nrequired during surgery. A catheter will also be insertedinto the patient’s bladder. The surgical procedure will bedescribed to the patient, along with the possible risks.\\nAftercare\\nNephrectomy patients may experience considerable\\ndiscomfort in the area of the incision. Patients may alsoexperience numbness, caused by severed nerves, near oron the incision. Pain relievers are administered followingthe surgical procedure and during the recovery period onan as-needed basis. Although deep breathing and cough-ing may be painful due to the proximity of the incision tothe diaphragm, breathing exercises are encouraged toprevent pneumonia . Patients should not drive an auto-\\nmobile for a minimum of two weeks.\\nRisks\\nPossible complications of a nephrectomy procedure\\ninclude infection, bleeding (hemorrhage), and post-oper-ative pneumonia. There is also the risk of kidney failurein a patient with impaired function or disease in theremaining kidney.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2332Nephrectomy'),\n",

Immediately following the procedure, itis normal for patients to experience pain near the incisionsite, particularly when coughing or breathing deeply.Renal function of the patient is monitored carefully afternephrectomy surgery. If the remaining kidney is healthy,it will increase its functioning over time to compensatefor the loss of the removed kidney.\\nLength of hospitalization depends on the type of\\nnephrectomy procedure. Patients undergoing a laparoscop-ic radical nephrectomy may be released within two to fourdays after surgery. Traditional open nephrectomy patientsare typically hospitalized for about a week.

Nephrotic syn-\\ndrome, however, occurs when this filter becomes defec-tive, allowing large quantities of protein to leave theblood circulation, and pass out or the body in the urine.\\nPatients with nephrotic syndrome are from all age\\ngroups, although in children there is an increased risk ofthe disorder between the ages of 18 months and fouryears. In children, boys are more frequently affected; inadults, the ratio of men to women is closer to equal.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nNephrotic syndrome can be caused by a number of\\ndifferent diseases. The common mechanism which seemsto cause damage involves the immune system. For somereason, the immune system seems to become directedagainst the person’s own kidney. The glomeruli becomeincreasingly leaky as various substances from theimmune system are deposited within the kidney.\\nA number of different kidney disorders are associat-\\ned with nephrotic syndrome, including:\\n• minimal change disease or MCD (responsible for about\\n80% of nephrotic syndrome in children, and about 20%in adults) MCD is a disorder of the glomeruli\\n• focal glomerulosclerosis• membranous glomerulopathy\\n• membranoproliferative glomerulonephropathy\\nOther types of diseases can also result in nephrotic\\nsyndrome. These include diabetes, sickle-cell anemia,amyloidosis ,systemic lupus erythematosus ,sarcoido-\\nsis, leukemia, lymphoma, cancer of the breast, colon,\\nand stomach, reactions to drugs (including nonsteroidal\\nanti-inflammatory drugs , lithium, and street heroine),\\nallergic reactions (to insect stings, snake venom, and poi-son ivy), infections ( malaria , various bacteria, hepatitis\\nB, herpes zoster, and the virus which causes AIDS ), and\\nsevere high blood pressure.\\nThe first symptom of nephrotic syndrome is often\\nfoamy urine. As the syndrome progresses, swelling(edema ) is noticed in the eyelids, hands, feet, knees, scro-\\ntum, and abdomen. The patient feels increasingly weakand fatigued. Appetite is greatly decreased. Over time, theloss of protein causes the muscles to become weak andsmall (called muscle wasting). The patient may noteabdominal pain and difficulty breathing. Because the kid-\\nneys are involved in blood pressure regulation, abnormal-ly low or abnormally high blood pressure may develop.\\nOver time, the protein loss occurring in nephrotic\\nsyndrome will result in a generally malnourished state.Hair and nails become brittle, and growth is stunted. Bonebecomes weak, and the body begins to lose other impor-tant nutrients (sugar, potassium, calcium). Infection is a\\nserious and frequent complication, as are disorders ofblood clotting. Acute kidney failure may develop.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is based first on the laboratory examina-\\ntion of the urine and the blood. While the urine willreveal significant quantities of protein, the blood willreveal abnormally low amounts of circulating proteins.Blood tests will also reveal a high level of cholesterol. Inorder to diagnose one of the kidney disorders whichcause nephrotic syndrome, a small sample of the kidney(biopsy) will need to be removed for examination. Thisbiopsy can be done with a long, very thin needle which isinserted through the skin under the ribs.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment depends on the underlying disorder which\\nhas caused nephrotic syndrome.

The first choice is usually a steroid drug (suchas prednisone). Some conditions may require even morepotent medications, such as cyclophosphamide orcyclosporine. Treating the underlying conditions (lym-phoma, cancers, heroine use, infections) which have ledto nephrotic syndrome will often improve the symptomsof nephrotic syndrome as well. Some patients willrequire the use of specific medications to control highblood pressure. Occasionally, the quantity of fluid apatient is allowed to drink is restricted.

Everyday, the kidneys filter about 45 gal (180 l) of blood, aboutfour times as much as the amount that passes through anyother organ. Because of this high volume, the kidneys aremore often exposed to toxic substances in the blood andare very vulnerable to injury from those sources.\\nEach kidney contains over one million structures\\ncalled nephrons. Each nephron consists of two parts: therenal corpuscle and the renal tubule. The renal corpuscleis where the blood is filtered. It is made up of a networkof capillaries (the glomerulus) and the structure that sur-rounds these capillaries (Bowman’s capsule). Blood flowsinto the glomerulus, where the liquid part of the blood(plasma) passes through the walls of the capillaries andinto Bowman’s capsule (blood cells and some proteins aretoo big to pass through and therefore remain in the bloodvessels). The plasma, now called filtrate, contains sub-stances that the body needs, such as water, glucose, andother nutrients, as well as wastes, excess salts, and excesswater. When the filtrate moves from Bowman’s capsuleinto the renal tubules, about 99% of it is taken back up asthe action of the tubules allows beneficial substances tobe reabsorbed into the blood stream. The remaining fil-trate is then passed to the bladder as urine.\\nWhen the kidneys are exposed to a toxic agent, either\\naccidentally or intentionally (as in a suicide attempt), dam-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2336Nephrotoxic injury'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 43}, page_content='age can occur in a number of different ways, depending\\nupon the agent. One toxin may directly affect the glomeru-lus or the renal tubules, causing the cells of these struc-tures to die. Another toxin may create other substances orconditions that result in the same cell death . Nephrotoxic\\ninjury can lead to acute renal failure, in which the kidneyssuddenly lose their ability to function, or chronic renalfailure, in which kidney function slowly deteriorates. Ifunchecked, renal failure can result in death.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSeveral different substances can be toxic to the kid-\\nneys. These include:\\n•antibiotics , primarily aminoglycosides , sulphon-\\namides, amphotericin B, polymyxin, neomycin, baci-tracin, rifampin, trimethoprim, cephaloridine, methi-cillin, aminosalicylic acid, oxy- and chlorotetracyclines\\n•analgesics , including acetaminophen (Tylenol), all\\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. aspirin ,\\nibuprofen), all prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors\\n• contrast agents used in some diagnostic tests, such as\\nsodium iodide\\n• heavy metals, such as lead, mercury, arsenic, and urani-\\num\\n• anti-cancer drugs, such as cyclosporin, cisplatin, and\\ncyclophosphamide\\n• methemoglobin-producing agents• solvents and fuels, such as carbon tetrachloride,\\nmethanol, amyl alcohol, and ethylene glycol\\n• herbicides and pesticides• overproduction of uric acid\\nNephrotoxic injury is most commonly caused by\\ndrugs, primarily antibiotics, analgesics, and contrastagents. In some cases, such as with aminoglycosides andamphotericin B, the drug itself will damage the kidneys.In others, such as with methicillin, sulphonamides, andsome contrast agents, the drug provokes an allergic reac-tion that destroys the kidneys. Some chemicals found incertain drugs and industrial agents damage the kidneys byconverting the hemoglobin of red blood cells into methe-moglobin, thereby interfering with the blood’s transportof oxygen. In hospitals, the most common form ofnephrotoxic injury is antibiotic nephropathy, which usual-ly occurs when antibiotics are given to patients withalready weakened kidneys. Analgesic nephropathy isanother common form of nephrotoxic injury and occursas a result of long-term abuse of analgesics, usuallyNSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen). Analgesic nephropathy is mostprevalent in women over 30. Lead nephropathy, arisingfrom lead poisoning , and nephropathy, from ingestion of\\nthe solvent carbon tetrachloride, are also more commonforms of nephrotoxic injury. Uric acid nephropathy is oneform of nephropathy that is not caused by exposure to anexternal toxin; instead, it arises from the body’s overpro-duction of uric acid, usually in persons with diseases ofthe lymph nodes or bone marrow.\\nRisk factors for nephrotoxic injury include:\\n• Age. The elderly are more likely to overdose on antibi-\\notics or analgesics.\\n• Underlying kidney disease. Kidneys already weakened\\nby conditions such as diabetes can be particularly sus-ceptible to nephrotoxic injury.\\n• Severe dehydration .\\n• Prolonged exposure to heavy metals or solvents on the\\njob or in the home.\\n• Presence of diseases that cause the overproduction of\\nuric acid.\\nSymptoms of nephrotoxic injury are wide ranging\\nand, in some cases, depend upon the type of toxininvolved. In general, symptoms are similar to those ofrenal failure and include excess urea in the blood(azotemia), anemia, increased hydrogen ion concentra-tion in the blood (acidosis), excess fluids in the body(overhydration ), and high blood pressure ( hyperten-\\nsion). Blood or pus may be present in the urine, as may\\nuric acid crystals. A decrease in urinary output may alsooccur. If the toxin’s effect on the kidneys remainsunchecked, more serious symptoms of kidney failuremay occur, including seizures and coma .\\nDiagnosis\\nDamage to the kidneys is assessed through a combi-\\nnation of physical examination , blood tests, urine tests,\\nand imaging procedures. Diagnosis of nephrotoxic injuryas the underlying cause results from a thorough investiga-tion of the patient’s history. Information regarding preex-isting conditions, current prescriptions, and environmen-tal exposures to toxins aid the physician in determiningwhat toxin, if any, has caused the kidneys to malfunction.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of nephrotoxic injury takes place in the\\nhospital and focuses on removing the toxin from thepatient’s system, while maintaining kidney function.Removal methods are targeted to specific toxins and mayinclude the use of diuretics or chelates to enhance excre-\\ntion of the toxin in urine, or, in extreme cases, the directremoval of toxins from the blood via hemodialysis orpassing the blood over an absorbent substance such as\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2337Nephrotoxic injury'),\n",

Support of kidney function depends on the\\nextent of damage to the organs and ranges from monitor-ing fluid levels to dialysis.\\nPrognosis\\nThe outcome of nephrotoxic injury is determined by\\nthe cause and severity of the damage. In cases wheredamage has not progressed beyond acute renal failure,kidney function can be fully restored once the toxin isremoved from the system and equilibrium restored.However, if permanent damage has resulted in chronicrenal failure, lifelong dialysis or a kidney transplant maybe required.\\nPrevention\\nExposure to nephrotoxins can be minimized several\\ndifferent ways. When taking antibiotics or analgesics,recommended dosages should be strictly followed.

Turkington\\nNeuroblastoma\\nDefinition\\nNeuroblastoma is a type of cancer that usually orig-\\ninates either in the tissues of the adrenal gland or in theganglia of the abdomen or in the ganglia of the nervoussystem. (Ganglia are masses of nerve tissue or groups ofnerve cells.) Tumors develop in the nerve tissue in theneck, chest, abdomen, or pelvis.\\nDescription\\nNeuroblastoma is one of the few cancer types known\\nto secrete hormones. It occurs most often in children, andit is the third most common cancer that occurs in children.Approximately 7.5% of the childhood cancers diagnosedin 2001 were neuroblastomas, affecting one in 80,000 to100,000 children in the United States. Close to 50% ofcases of neuroblastoma occur in children younger thantwo years old. The disease is sometimes present at birth,but is usually not noticed until later. By the time the dis-ease is diagnosed, it has often spread to the lymph nodes,liver, lungs, bones, or bone marrow. Approximately one-third of neuroblastomas start in the adrenal glands.\\nDemographics\\nAccording to some reports, African-American chil-\\ndren develop the disease at a slightly higher rate thanCaucasian children (8.7 per million compared to 8.0 permillion cases diagnosed).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe causes of neuroblastoma are not precisely\\nknown. Current research holds that neuroblastomasdevelop when cells produced by the fetus (neuroblast\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2340Neuroblastoma'),\n",

The first symptomof a neuroblastoma is usually an unusual growth or lump,found in most cases in the abdomen of the child, causingdiscomfort or a sensation of fullness and pain . Other\\nsymptoms such as numbness and fatigue , arise because\\nof pressure caused by the tumor. Bone pain also occurs ifthe cancer has spread to the bone. If it has spread to thearea behind the eye, the cancer may cause protrudingeyes and dark circles around the eyes. Or paralysis may\\nresult from compression of the spinal cord. Fever is also\\nreported in one case out of four. High blood pressure,persistent diarrhea , rapid heartbeat, reddening of the\\nskin and sweating occur occasionally. Some childrenmay also have uncoordinated or jerky muscle move-ments, or uncontrollable eye movements, but thesesymptoms are rare. If the disease spreads to the skin, blueor purple patches are observed.\\nDiagnosis\\nA diagnosis of neuroblastoma usually requires blood\\nand urine tests to investigate the nature and quantity ofchemicals (neurotransmitters) released by the nerve cells.These are broken down by the body and released inurine. Additionally, scanning techniques are used to con-firm the diagnosis of neuroblastoma. These techniquesproduce images or pictures of the inside of the body andthey include computed tomography scan (CT scan) andmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To confirm the\\ndiagnosis, the physician will surgically remove some ofthe tissue from the tumor or bone marrow (biopsy), andexamine the cells under the microscope.\\nTreatment team\\nThe treatment team usually consists of an oncologist\\nspecialized in the treatment of neuroblastoma, a surgeonto perform biopsies and possibly attempt surgicalremoval of the tumor, a radiation therapy team and, if\\nindicated, a bone marrow transplantation team.\\nTreatment\\nStaging\\nOnce neuroblastoma has been diagnosed, the physi-\\ncian will perform more tests to determine if the cancerhas spread to other tissues in the body. This process,called staging, is important for the physician to deter-mine how to treat the cancer and check liver and kidneyfunction. The staging system for neuroblastoma is basedon how far the disease has spread from its original site toother tissues in the body.Localized resectable (able to be cut out) neuroblas-\\ntoma is confined to the site of origin, with no evidencethat it has spread to other tissues, and the cancer can besurgically removed. Localized unresectable neuroblas-toma is confined to the site of origin, but the cancer can-not be completely removed surgically. Regional neurob-lastoma has extended beyond its original site, to regionallymph nodes, and/or surrounding organs or tissues, buthas not spread to distant sites in the body. Disseminatedneuroblastoma has spread to distant lymph nodes, bone,liver, skin, bone marrow, and/or other organs. Stage 4S(or IVS, or “special”) neuroblastoma has spread only toliver, skin, and/or, to a very limited extent, bone marrow.Recurrent neuroblastoma means that the cancer hascome back, or continued to spread after it has been treat-ed. It may come back in the original site or in anotherpart of the body.\\nTreatments are available for children with all stages\\nof neuroblastoma. More than one of these treatmentsmay be used, depending on the stage of the disease. Thefour types of treatment used are:\\n• surgery (removing the tumor in an operation)• radiation therapy (using high-energy x-rays to kill can-\\ncer cells)\\n•chemotherapy (using drugs to kill cancer cells)\\n• bone marrow transplantation (replacing the patient’s\\nbone marrow cells with those from a healthy person)\\nSurgery is used whenever possible, to remove as\\nmuch of the cancer as possible, and can generally curethe disease if the cancer has not spread to other areasof the body. Before surgery, chemotherapy may beused to shrink the tumor so that it can be more easilyremoved during surgery; this is called neoadjuvantchemotherapy. Radiation therapy is often used aftersurgery; high-energy rays (radiation) are used to kill as\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2341Neuroblastoma\\nA neuroblastoma appearing at the surface of the liver.

Bonemarrow transplantation is used to replace bone marrowcells killed by radiation or chemotherapy. In somecases the patient’s own bone marrow is removed priorto treatment and saved for transplantation later. Othertimes the bone marrow comes from a “matched” donor,such as a sibling.\\nAlternative treatment\\nNo alternative therapy has yet been reported to sub-\\nstitute for conventional neuroblastoma treatment.

They produceand secrete a variety of regulatory hormones, or neu-ropeptides, which include neurotransmitters and growthfactors. When these cells become cancerous, they growand overproduce their specific neuropeptide. Neuroen-docrine tumors are generally rare. One type of neuroen-docrine tumor is a carcinoid tumor. This type of tumorcan occur in the intestinal tract, appendix, rectum,bronchial tubes, or ovary. Most carcinoid tumors secreteserotonin. When the blood concentration of this hormoneis high enough, it causes carcinoid syndrome. This syn-drome refers to a variety of symptoms that are caused bythe excessive amount of hormone secreted rather than thetumor itself.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMany of the symptoms of carcinoid tumor are due\\nto the hormones that the tumor secretes. These hor-mones can affect the whole body and cause what isreferred to as carcinoid syndrome. The most commonsymptom of carcinoid syndrome is flushing, a suddenappearance of redness and warmth in the face and neckthat can last from minutes to hours. Other symptoms ofcarcinoid syndrome are diarrhea , asthma-like symp-\\ntoms and heart problems. Since most carcinoid tumorsare found in the appendix, the symptoms are often simi-lar to appendicitis , primarily pain in the abdomen.\\nWhen these tumors are found in the small intestine, theycan cause abdominal pain that is often initially diag-nosed as bowel obstruction. Many patients have nosymptoms and the carcinoids are found during routineendoscopy of the intestines.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome is made by\\nthe measurement of 5–hydroxy indole acetic acid(5–HIAA) in the urine. 5–HIAA is a breakdown (waste)product of serotonin. If the syndrome is diagnosed, thepresence of carcinoid tumor is a given. When the syn-drome is not present, diagnosis may be delayed, due tothe vague symptoms present. Diagnosis can sometimestake up to two years. It is made by performing a numberof tests, and the specific test used depends on thetumor’s suspected location. The tests that may be per-formed include gastrointestinal endoscopy, chest x ray ,\\ncomputed tomography scan (CT scan), magnetic reso-\\nnance imaging , or ultrasound. A biopsy of the tumor is\\nperformed for diagnosis. A variety of hormones can bemeasured in the blood as well to indicate the presenceof a carcinoid.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2343Neuroendocrine tumors'),\n",

These tumors occurunder the skin and throughout the nervous system.\\nDescription\\nNeural crest cells are primitive cells which exist dur-\\ning fetal development. These cells eventually turn into:\\n• cells which form nerves throughout the brain, spinal\\ncord, and body\\n• cells which serve as coverings around the nerves that\\ncourse through the body\\n• pigment cells, which provide color to structures• the meninges, the thin, membranous coverings of the\\nbrain and spinal cord\\n• cells which ultimately develop into the bony structures\\nof the head and neck\\nIn neurofibromatosis, a genetic defect causes these\\nneural crest cells to develop abnormally. This results innumerous tumors and malformations of the nerves,bones, and skin.\\nNeurofibromatosis occurs in about one of every\\n4,000 births. Two types of NF exist, NF-1 (90% of allcases), and NF-2 (10% of all cases).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBoth forms of neurofibromatosis are caused by a\\ndefective gene. NF-1 is due to a defect on chromosome17; NF-2 results from a defect on chromosome 22. Bothof these disorders are inherited in a dominant fashion.This means that anybody who receives just one defectivegene will have the disease. However, a family pattern ofNF is only evident for about half of all cases of NF. Theother cases of NF occur due to a spontaneous mutation (apermanent change in the structure of a specific gene).Once such a spontaneous mutation has been establishedin an individual, however, it is then possible to be passedon to any offspring. The chance of a person with NFpassing on the NF gene to a child is 50%.\\nNF-1 has a number of possible signs and can be\\ndiagnosed if any two of the following are present:\\n• The presence of café-au-lait (French for coffee-with-\\nmilk) spots. These are patches of tan or light brownskin, usually about 5-15 mm in diameter. Nearly allpatients with NF-1 will display these spots.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2344Neurofibromatosis'),\n",

These soft tumors are the hallmark of\\nNF-1. They occur under the skin, often located alongnerves or within the gastrointestinal tract. Neurofibro-mas are small and rubbery, and the skin overlying themmay be somewhat purple in color.\\n• Skeletal deformities, such as a twisted spine ( scoliosis ),\\ncurved spine (humpback), or bowed legs.\\n• Tumors along the optic nerve, which cause vision dis-\\nturbance in about 20% of patients.\\n• The presence of NF-1 in a patient’s parent, child, or\\nsibling.\\nThere are very high rates of speech impairment,\\nlearning disabilities, and attention deficit disorder in chil-dren with NF-1. Other complications include the devel-opment of a seizure disorder , or the abnormal accumu-\\nlation of fluid within the brain ( hydrocephalus ). A num-\\nber of cancers are more common in patients with NF-1.These include a variety of types of malignant braintumors, as well as leukemia, and cancerous tumors ofcertain muscles (rhabdomyosarcoma), the adrenal glands(pheochromocytoma ), or the kidneys ( Wilms’ tumor ).\\nPatients with NF-2 do not necessarily have the same\\ncharacteristic skin symptoms (café-au-lait spots, freck-ling, and neurofibromas of the skin) that appear in NF-1.The characteristic symptoms of NF-2 are due to tumorsalong the acoustic nerve. Interfering with the function ofthis nerve results in the loss of hearing; and the tumormay spread to neighboring nervous system structures,causing weakness of the muscles of the face, headache ,\\ndizziness , poor balance, and uncoordinated walking.\\nCloudy areas on the lens of the eye (called cataracts )\\nfrequently develop at an unusually early age. As in NF-1,the chance of brain tumors developing is unusually high.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is based on the symptoms outlined above.\\nDiagnosis of NF-1 requires that at least two of the listedsigns are present. Diagnosis of NF-2 requires the pres-ence of either a mass on the acoustic nerve or anotherdistinctive nervous system tumor. An important diagnos-tic clue for either NF-1 or NF-2 is the presence of thedisorder in a patient’s parent, child, or sibling.\\nMonitoring the progression of neurofibromatosis\\ninvolves careful testing of vision and hearing. X-raystudies of the bones are frequently done to watch for thedevelopment of deformities. CT scans and MRI scans areperformed to track the development/progression oftumors in the brain and along the nerves. Auditoryevoked potentials (the electric response evoked in the\\ncerebral cortex by stimulation of the acoustic nerve) maybe helpful to determine involvement of the acousticnerve, and EEG (electroencephalogram, a record of elec-trical currents in the brain) may be needed for patientswith suspected seizures.\\nTreatment\\nThere are no available treatments for the disorders\\nwhich underlie either type of neurofibromatosis. To someextent, the symptoms of NF-1 and NF-2 can be treatedindividually. Skin tumors can be surgically removed.Some brain tumors, and tumors along the nerves, can besurgically removed, or treated with drugs ( chemothera-\\npy) or x-ray treatments ( radiation therapy ). Twisting or\\ncurving of the spine and bowed legs may require surgicaltreatment, or the wearing of a special brace.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis varies depending on the types of tumors\\nwhich an individual develops. As tumors grow, theybegin to destroy surrounding nerves and structures. Ulti-mately, this destruction can result in blindness, deafness,increasingly poor balance, and increasing difficulty withthe coordination necessary for walking. Deformities ofthe bones and spine can also interfere with walking andmovement. When cancers develop, prognosis worsensaccording to the specific type of cancer .\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2345Neurofibromatosis\\nThis person’s skin has multiple soft tumors, or neurofibro-\\nmas.

Amniocentesis or chorionic villus sam-\\npling are two techniques which allow small amounts of\\nthe baby’s cells to be removed for examination. The tis-sue can then be examined for the presence of the parent’sgenetic defect. Some families choose to use this informa-tion in order to prepare for the arrival of a child with aserious medical problem. Other families may choose notto continue the pregnancy.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHaslam, Robert H. A. “Neurocutaneous Syndromes.” In Nelson\\nTextbook of Pediatrics , ed. Richard E. Behrman.

The reflexto urinate is triggered when the bladder fills to 300-500ml. The bladder is then emptied when the contraction ofthe bladder wall muscles forces urine out through theurethra. The bladder, internal sphincters, and externalsphincters may all be affected by nerve disorders thatcreate abnormalities in bladder function.\\nThere are two categories of neurogenic bladder dys-\\nfunction: overactive (spastic or hyper-reflexive) andunderactive (flaccid or hypotonic). An overactive neuro-genic bladder is characterized by uncontrolled, frequentexpulsion of urine from the bladder. There is reduced blad-der capacity and incomplete emptying of urine. An under-active neurogenic bladder has a capacity that is extremelylarge (up to 2000 ml). Due to a loss of the sensation ofbladder filling, the bladder does not contract forcefully,and small amounts of urine dribble from the urethra as thebladder pressure reaches a breakthrough point.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are numerous causes for neurogenic bladder\\ndysfunction and symptoms vary depending on the cause.An overactive bladder is caused by interruptions in thenerve pathways to the bladder occurring above thesacrum (five fused spinal vertebrae located just above thetailbone or coccyx ). This nerve damage results in a loss\\nof sensation and motor control and is often seen in\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2346Neurogenic bladder'),\n",

An underactive bladder is the result ofinterrupted bladder stimulation at the level of the sacralnerves. This may result from certain types of surgery onthe spinal cord, sacral spinal tumors, or congenitaldefects. It also may be a complication of various dis-eases, such as syphilis ,diabetes mellitus , or polio .\\nDiagnosis\\nNeurogenic bladder is diagnosed by carefully\\nrecording fluid intake and urinary output and by measur-ing the quantity of urine remaining in the bladder aftervoiding (residual urine volume). This measurement isdone by draining the bladder with a small rubber tube(catheter) after the person has urinated. Kidney functionalso is evaluated by regular laboratory testing of theblood and urine. Cystometry may be used to estimate\\nthe capacity of the bladder and the pressure changeswithin it. These measurements can help determinechanges in bladder compliance in order to assess theeffectiveness of treatment. Doctors may use a cystoscopeto look inside the bladder and tubes that lead to it fromthe kidneys (ureters). Cystoscopy may be used to assessKEY TERMS\\nAnticholinergic —An agent that blocks certain\\nnerve impulses.\\nCatheterization —Insertion of a slender, flexible\\ntube into the bladder to drain urine.\\nCompliance —A term used to describe how well a\\npatient’s behavior follows medical advice.\\nCystometry —A test of bladder function in which\\npressure and volume of fluid in the bladder aremeasured during filling, storage, and voiding.\\nCystoscopy —A direct method of bladder study and\\nvisualization using a cystoscope (self-containedoptical lens system).

Inintermittent catheterization, a small rubber catheter isinserted at regular intervals (four to six times per day) toapproximate normal bladder function. This avoids thecomplications that may occur when a catheter remains inthe bladder’s outside opening (urethra) continuously (anindwelling catheter). Intermittent catheterization shouldbe performed using strict sterile technique (asepsis) byskilled personnel, and hourly fluid intake and outputmust be recorded. Patients who can use their arms maybe taught to catheterize themselves.\\nIndwelling catheters avoid distension by emptying the\\nbladder continuously into a bedside drainage collector. Indi-viduals with indwelling catheters are encouraged to main-tain a high fluid intake in order to prevent bacteria fromaccumulating and growing in the urine. Increased fluidintake also decreases the concentration of calcium in the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2347Neurogenic bladder'),\n",

Moving around as much as possibleand a low calcium diet also help to reduce stone formation.\\nDrugs may be used to control the symptoms pro-\\nduced by a neurogenic bladder. The unwanted contrac-tions of an overactive bladder with only small volumes ofurine may be suppressed by drugs that relax the bladder(anticholinergics) such as propantheline (Pro-Banthine)and oxybutynin (Ditropan). Contraction of an underac-tive bladder with normal bladder volumes may be stimu-lated with parasympathomimetics (drugs that mimic theaction resulting from stimulation of the parasympatheticnerves) such as bethanechol (Urecholine).\\nLong-term management for the individual with an\\noveractive bladder is aimed at establishing an effectivespontaneous reflex voiding. The amount of fluid taken inis controlled in measured amounts during the wakinghours, with sips only toward bedtime to avoid bladderdistension. At regular intervals during the day (every fourto six hours when fluid intake is two to three liters per 24hours), the patient attempts to void using pressure overthe bladder (Crede maneuver). The patient may alsostimulate reflex voiding by abdominal tapping or stretch-ing of the anal sphincter. The Valsalva maneuver ,\\ninvolving efforts similar to those used when straining topass stool, produces an increase in intra-abdominal pres-sure that is sometimes adequate to completely empty thebladder. The amount of urine remaining in the bladder(residual volume) is estimated by a comparison of fluidintake and output. The patient also may be catheterizedimmediately following the voiding attempt to determineresidual urine. Catheterization intervals are lengthened asthe residual urine volume decreases and catheterizationmay be discontinued when urine residuals are at anacceptable level to prevent urinary tract infection.\\nFor an underactive bladder, the patient may be\\nplaced on a similar bladder routine with fluid intake andoutput adjusted to prevent bladder distension. If an ade-quate voiding reflex cannot be induced, the patient maybe maintained on clean intermittent catheterization.\\nSome individuals who are unable to control urine\\noutput ( urinary incontinence ) due to deficient sphincter\\ntone may benefit from perineal exercises. Although thisis a somewhat dated technique, male patients with exten-sive sphincter damage may be helped by the use of aCunningham clamp. The clamp is applied in a horizontalfashion behind the glans of the penis and must beremoved approximately every four hours for bladderemptying to prevent bacteria from growing in the urineand causing an infection. Alternation of the Cunninghamclamp with use of a condom collection device will\\nreduce the skin irritation sometimes caused by the clamp.Surgery is another treatment option for incontinence.\\nUrinary diversion away from the bladder may involve cre-ation of a urostomy or a continent diversion. The surgicalimplantation of an inflatable sphincter is another optionfor certain patients. An indwelling urinary catheter issometimes used when all other methods of incontinencemanagement have failed. The long-term use of anindwelling catheter almost inevitably leads to some uri-nary tract infections, and contributes to the formation ofurinary stones (calculi). Doctors may prescribe antibiotics\\npreventively to reduce recurrent urinary tract infection.\\nAlternative treatment\\nThe cause of the bladder problem must be deter-\\nmined and treated appropriately. If nerve damage is notpermanent, homeopathy and acupuncture may help\\nrestore function.\\nPrognosis\\nIndividuals with an overactive bladder caused by\\nspinal cord lesions at or above the seventh thoracic verte-bra, are at risk for sympathetic dysreflexia, a life-threat-ening condition which can occur when the bladder(and/or rectum) becomes overly full. Initial symptomsinclude sweating (particularly on the forehead) andheadache , with progression to slow heart rate (bradycar-\\ndia) and high blood pressure ( hypertension ). Patients\\nshould notify their physician promptly if symptoms donot subside after the bladder (or rectum) is emptied, or ifthe bladder (or rectum) is full and cannot be emptied.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAgency for Health Care Policy and Research.

These limiting beliefs are“reprogrammed” using a variety of techniques drawnfrom other disciplines including hypnotherapy and psy-\\nchotherapy.\\nPurpose\\nNeurolinguistic programming has been used to\\nchange the limiting beliefs of patients about theirprospects of recovery from a wide variety of medical con-ditions including Parkinson’s disease ,AIDS , migraines,\\narthritis, and cancer . Practitioners claim to be able to cure\\nmost phobias in less than one hour, and to help in making\\nlifestyle changes regarding exercise , diet, smoking , etc.\\nNLP has also been used to treat allergies . In other fields,\\nclaimed benefits include improved relationships, commu-nication, motivation, and business performance.\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nNLP was originally developed during the early\\n1970s by linguistics professor John Grinder and psychol-ogy and mathematics student Richard Bandler, both ofthe University of California at Santa Cruz.\\nStudying the well-known psychotherapist Virginia\\nSatir, the hypnotherapist Milton Erickson, the anthropol-ogist Gregory Bateson, and others whom they considered“charismatic superstars” in their fields, Grinder and Ban-dler identified psychological, linguistic and behavioralcharacteristics that they said contributed to the greatnessof these individuals. On the other hand, they found thatpersons experiencing emotional difficulties could be sim-ilarly identified by posture, breathing pattern, choice ofwords, voice tone, eye movements, body language, andother characteristics.\\nGrinder and Bandler then focused on using these\\nindicators to analyze and alter patterns of thought andbehavior. After publishing their findings in two books in1975, Grinder and Bandler parted company with them-selves, with a number of other collaborators, and with theUniversity of California, continuing their work on NLPoutside the formal world of academia. As a result, NLPsplit into a number of competing schools.\\nPopularized by television “infomercial” personality\\nAnthony Robbins and others, NLP was quickly adoptedin management and self-improvement circles. During the1990s, there was growing interest in NLP’s healingpotential.\\nIn a health-care context, practitioners of neurolin-\\nguistic programming first seek to identify the negativeattitudes and beliefs with which a client has been “pro-grammed” since birth. This is accomplished by askingquestions and observing physical responses such aschanges in skin color, muscle tension, etc. Then, a widevariety of techniques is employed to “reprogram” limit-ing beliefs. For example, clients with chronic illness suchas AIDS or cancer might be asked to displace the despairand loss of identity caused by the disease by visualizingthemselves in vigorous health. Treatment by NLP practi-tioners is often of shorter duration than that of otheralternative practitioners, but NLP self-help seminars andcourses can be quite expensive.\\nFor those who wish to try self-treatment with NLP, a\\nwide variety of books, audio tapes, and videos are available.\\nPrecautions\\nNLP is particularly popular in the self-improvement\\nand career-development fields, and some trainers andpractitioners have little experience in its use for healing.Practitioners should be specifically asked about this.\\nBecause NLP is intended to enhance the healing\\nprocess, it should not be used independently of otherhealing methods. In all cases of serious illness, a physi-cian should be consulted.\\nSide effects\\nNLP is believed to be generally free of harmful side\\neffects.\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nAlthough some physicians and mental health practi-\\ntioners employ principles of neurolinguistic program-ming, the field is generally considered outside of main-stream medical practice and academic thinking.\\nResources\\nORGANIZATIONS\\nAssociation for NLP.

It is a\\nsystematic examination that surveys the functioning ofnerves delivering sensory information to the brain andcaring motor commands (Peripheral nervous system) andimpulses back to the brain for processing and coordinat-ing (Central nervous system).\\nPurpose\\nA careful neurological evaluation can help to deter-\\nmine the cause of impairment since a clinician can beginlocalizing the problem. Symptoms that occur unexpect-edly suggest a blood vessel or seizure problem. Thosethat are not so sudden suggest a possible tumor. Symp-toms that have a waning course with recurrences andworsen over time suggest a disease that destroys nervecells. Others that are chronic and progressive indicate adegenerative disorder. In cases of trauma, symptoms maybe evident upon inspection and causes may be explainedby third party witnesses. Some patients may requireextensive neurological screening examination (NSE)and/or neurological examination (NE) to determine thecause. The NH will assist the clinician to diagnose ill-nesses such as seizure disorders, narcolepsy , migraine\\ndisorders, dizziness , and dementia .\\nDescription\\nA neurological screening is an essential component\\nof every comprehensive physical examination. In casesof neurological trauma, disease, or psychological disor-ders patients are usually given a very in-depth neurologi-cal examination. The examination is best performed in asystematic manner, which means that there is a recom-mended order for procedures.\\nNeurological screening examination\\nThe NSE is basic procedure especially in patients\\nwho have a general neurological complaint or symptoms.The NSE consists of six areas of assessment:\\n• mental status: assessing normal orientation to time,\\nplace, space, and speech\\n• cranial nerves: checking the eyes with a special light\\nsource (ophthalmoscope), and also assessment of facialmuscles strength and functioning\\n• motor: checking for tone, drift, heal, and toe and walking• sensory: cold and vibration tests• coordination: observing the patient walk and finger to\\nnose testing\\n• reflexes: using a special instrument the clinician taps an\\narea above a nerve to emit a reflex (usually movementof muscle groups)\\nNeurological examination\\nThe NE should be performed on a patient suspected\\nof having neurological trauma, neurological, or psycho-logical diseases. The NE is performed in a systematicand comprehensive manner. The NE consists of severalcomprehensive and in-depth assessments of mental sta-tus, cranial nerves, motor examination, reflexes, sensoryexamination, and posture and walking (gait) analysis.\\nMENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION (MSE). There are\\ntwo types of MSE, informal and formal. The informalMSE is usually done when clinicians are obtaining his-torical information from a patient. The formal MSE isperformed in a patient suspected of a neurological prob-lem. The patient is commonly asked his/her name, thelocation, the day, and date. Retentive memory capabilityand immediate recall can be assessed by determining thenumber of digits that can be repeated in sequence.Recent memory is typically examined by testing recallpotential of a series of objects after defined times, usual-ly within five and 15 minutes. Remote memory can beassessed by asking the patient to review in a coherent andchronological fashion, his or her illness or personal lifeevents that the patient feels comfortable talking about.Patient recall of common historical or current events canbe utilized to assess general knowledge. Higher function-ing (referring to brain processing capabilities) can beassessed by spontaneous speech, repetition, reading,naming, writing, and comprehension. The patient may beasked to perform further tasks such as identification offingers, whistling, saluting, brushing teeth motions,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2350Neurologic exam'),\n",

These proce-\\ndures will assess the intactness of what is called domi-nant (left-sided brain) functioning or higher corticalfunction referring to the portion of the brain that regu-lates these activities.\\nThe MSE is particularly important in the specialty of\\npsychotherapy. Psychotherapists recommend an in-depthMSE to all patients with possible organic (referring tothe body) or psychotic disorders. This examination isalso performed in a systematic and orderly manner. It isdivided into several categories:\\n• Appearance: This assessment determines the patient’s\\npresentation, i.e. how the patient looks (clothes posture,grooming, and alertness).\\n• Behavior: This assesses the patient’s motor (move-\\nments) activity such as walking, gestures, musculartwitching, and impulse control.\\n• Speech: the patient’s speech can be examined concern-\\ning volume, rate of speech and coherence. Patients whoexhibit latent or delayed speech can indicate depres-sion, while a rapid or pressured speech may suggestpossible mania or anxiety .\\n• Mood and affect: Normal mood is term euthymia.\\nThere is variation in mood presentations and patientsmay display a flat, labile, blunted, constructed or inap-propriate mood. The patient can also be euphoric (ele-vated) or dysphoric (on the down side).\\n• Thought processes and content: This category is typi-\\ncally assessed by determining word usage (can indicatebrain disease), thought stream (whether thoughts areslow, restricted, blocked, or overabundant), continuityof thought (referring to associations among ideas), andcontent of thought (delusional thoughts).\\n• Perception: This assessment examines the patient’s\\nability to hear, see, touch, taste, and smell. Certain psy-chological states may cause hearing and visual halluci-\\nnations . Impairments of smell and touch are usually\\ncaused by medical (organic) causes or as side effectsfrom certain medications.\\n• Attention and concentration: This clinician assesses the\\npatient’s ability to focus on a specific task or activity.Abnormalities in attention and concentration can indi-cate problems related to anxiety or hallucinations.\\n• Orientation: The patient is examined for orientation to\\ntime, place, and identification of self (asking thepatient his/her name). Disturbances in orientation canbe due to a medical condition (other than psychologi-cal), substance abuse, or as a side effect of certainmedications such as those used to treat depression,anxiety or psychosis (since these medications usually\\nhave a sedative affect).• Memory: Patients are examined for remote, recent, and\\nimmediate memory capabilities. Remote and recentmemory can be assessed by the patient’s ability torecall historical and current events. Immediate memorycan be tested by naming three objects and asking thepatient to repeat the named objects immediately, thenafter five and 15 minute intervals.\\n• Judgment: This category evaluates the patient’s ability\\nto exercise appropriate judgment. It also determineswhether the patient has an understanding of conse-quences associated with their actions.\\n• Intelligence and information: The only precise mea-\\nsurement for this category can be obtained by adminis-tering specialized intelligence tests, However a prelimi-nary assessment of intelligence can be made based onthe patient’s fund of information, general knowledge,awareness of current events, and the ability for abstractthinking (thinking of unique concepts).\\n• Insight: Insight in the MSE pertains to the patient’s\\nawareness of their problem that prompted them to seekprofessional examination. Insight concerning the pre-sent illness can range from denial to fleeting admissionof current illness.\\nCRANIAL NERVES (CN). Cranial nerves are special-\\nized nerves that originate in the brain and connect to spe-cialized structures such as the nose, eyes, muscles in theface, scalp, ear, and tongue.\\n• CNI: This nerve checks for visual capabilities. Patients\\nare usually given the Snellen Chart (a chart with rowsof large and small letters). Patients read letters with oneeye at a time.\\n• CN III, IV , and VI: These nerves examine the pupillary\\n(the circular center structure of the eye that light raysenter) reaction. The pupils get smaller, normally whenexposed to the light. The eyelids are also examined fordrooping or retraction. The eyeball is also checked forabnormalities in movement.\\n• CNV: The clinician can assess the muscles on both sides\\nof the scalp muscles (the temporalis muscle). Addition-ally the jaw can be tested for motion resistance, open-ing, protrusion, and side-to-side mobility. The cornealocated is a transparent tissue covering the eyeball andcould be tested for intactness by lightly brushing a wispof cotton directly on the outside of the eye.\\n• CNVII: Examination of CNVII assesses asymmetry of\\nthe face at rest and during spontaneous movements. Thepatient is asked to raise eyebrows, wrinkle forehead,close eyes, frown, smile, puff cheeks, purse lips, whis-tle, and contract chin muscles. Taste for the front andmiddle portions of the tongue can also be examined.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2351Neurologic exam'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 58}, page_content='• CNVIII: Testing for this CN deals with hearing. The\\nclinician usually uses a special instrument called a tun-ing fork and tests for air conduction and structuralproblems which can occur inside the ear.\\n• CN IX and X: These tests will evaluate certain struc-\\ntures in the mouth. The clinician will usually ask thepatient to say “aah” and can detect abnormal position-ing of certain structures such as the palatel-uvula. Theexaminer will also assess the sensation capabilities ofthe pharynx, by stimulating the area with a woodentongue depressor, causing a gag reflex.\\n• CNXI: This nerve is usually examined by asking the\\npatient to shrug shoulders (testing a muscle called thetrapezius) and rotating the head to each side (testing amuscle called the sternocleidomastoid). These musclesare responsible for movement of the shoulders andneck. The test is usually done with resistance, meaningthe examiner holds the area while the patient is askedto move. This is done to assess patient’s strength inthese areas.\\n• CNXII: This nerve tests the bulk and power of the\\ntongue. The examiner looks for tongue protrusionand/or abnormal movements.\\nMOTOR EXAMINATION. The motor examination\\nassesses the patient’s muscle strength, tone, and shape.Muscles could be abnormally larger than expected (hyper-trophy) or small due to tissues destruction (atrophy). It isimportant to assess if there is evidence of twitching orabnormal movements. Involuntary movements due to ticsor myoclonus can be observed. Additionally, movementscan be abnormal during maintained posture in neurologi-cal disorders such as Parkinson’s disease . Muscle tone is\\nusually tested by applying resistance to passive motion ofa relaxed limb. Power is assessed for movements at eachjoint. Decreases or increases in muscle tone can help theexaminer localize the affected area.\\nREFLEXES. The patient’s reflexes are tested by using\\na special instrument that looks like a little hammer. Theclinician will tap the rubber triangular shaped end in sev-eral different areas in the arms, knee, and Achilles healarea. The clinician will ask the patient to relax and gentlytap the area. If there is a difference in response from theleft to right knee, then there may be an underlying prob-lem that merits further evaluation. A difference in reflex-es between the arms and legs usually indicates of a lesioninvolving the spinal cord. Depressed reflexes in only onelimb, while the other limb demonstrates a normalresponse usually indicates a peripheral nerve lesion.\\nSENSORY EXAMINATION. Although a very essential\\ncomponent of the NE, the sensory examination is theleast informative and least exacting since it requirespatient concentration and cooperation. Five primary sen-\\nsory categories are assessed: vibration (using a tuningfork), joint position (examiner moves the limb side-to-side and in a downward position), light touch, pinprick,and temperature. Patients who have sensory abnormali-ties may have a lesion above the thalamus. Spinal cordlesions or disease can possibly be detected by pinprickand temperature assessment.\\nCOORDINATION. The patient is asked to repetitively\\ntouch his nose using his index finger and then to touch theclinician’s outstretched finger. Coordination can also beassessed by asking the patient to alternate tapping the palmthen the back of one hand on the thigh. For coordination inthe lower extremities on legs, the patient lies on his or herback and is asked to slide the heel of each foot from theknee down the shin of the opposite leg and to raise the legand touch the examiners index finger with the great toe.\\nWALKING (GAIT). Normal walking is a complex\\nprocess and requires usage of multiple systems such aspower, coordination and sensation working together in acoordinated fashion. The examination of gait can detect avariety of disease states. Decreased arm swinging on oneside is indicative of corticospinal tract disease. A stoopeddown posture and short-stepped gait may suggest Parkin-son’s syndrome. A high stepped, slapping gait may be theresult of a peripheral nerve disease.\\nPreparation\\nThe MSE is the first step in a continuous assessment\\nto determine the diagnosis a psychotherapist should take adetailed medical history in the process of ruling out a gen-eral medical condition. If a general medical disease issuspected, referral is indicated to rule out this category.Once a medical condition has been fully excluded thetherapist can then localize the components of an abnormalMSE to determine the underlying psychological disorder.Once this is determined treatment may included, but isnot limited to therapy sessions and/or medication. Forneurological diseases the clinician will use informationgained from the NE for ordering further tests. These testsmay include a complete blood analysis, liver function\\ntests,kidney function tests , hormone tests, and a lumbar\\npuncture to determine abnormalities in cerebrospinalfluid. In cases a trauma (car accident, sports injury) theNE is a quick and essential component of emergencyassessment. One a diagnosis is determined emergencymeasures may include further tests and/or surgery.\\nAftercare\\nCare is usually specific once the final diagnosis has\\nbeen determined. In psychological cases the treatmentmay include therapy and/or medication. In causes of an\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2352Neurologic exam'),\n",

The MSE and NE are good diagnostic tools.Further testing using advanced technological proceduresare usually required for definitive diagnosis and initiationof disease-specific treatment.\\nThe outcome depends ultimately on the final diagno-\\nsis. Neurological diseases typically follow a chroniccourse. Situations that present as trauma may require sur-gical intervention and intensive care with an outcomeusually proportional to extent of injuries.

Neutrophils are white blood cells(WBCs) produced in the bone marrow that ingest bacte-ria. Neutropenia is sometimes called agranulocytosis orgranulocytopenia because neutrophils make up about60% of WBCs and have granules inside their cell walls.Neutropenia is a serious disorder because it makes thebody vulnerable to bacterial and fungal infections.\\nDescription\\nThe normal level of neutrophils in human blood\\nvaries slightly by age and race. Infants have lower countsthan older children and adults, and African Americanshave lower counts than Caucasians or Asians. The aver-age adult level is 1500 cells/mm\\n3of blood. Neutrophil\\ncounts (in cells/mm3) are interpreted as follows:\\n• greater than 1000. Normal protection against infection.\\n• 500–1000. Some increased risk of infection.• 200–500. Great risk of severe infection.• lower than 200. Risk of overwhelming infection; requires\\nhospital treatment with antibiotics .\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nNeutropenia may result from three processes:\\nDECREASED WBC PRODUCTION. Lowered produc-\\ntion of white blood cells is the most common cause ofneutropenia. It can result from:\\n• medications that affect the bone marrow, including\\ncancer drugs, chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin), anti-\\nconvulsant medications, and antipsychotic drugs\\n(Thorazine, Prolixin, and other phenothiazines)\\n• hereditary and congenital disorders that affect the bone\\nmarrow, including familial neutropenia, cyclic neu-tropenia, and infantile agranulocytosis\\n• cancer, including certain types of leukemia• radiation therapy\\n• exposure to pesticides\\n• vitamin B\\n12and folate ( folic acid ) deficiency\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2353Neutropenia'),\n",

Affected individuals usually suffer these episodeswithin a few hours after going to sleep. They appear tobolt up suddenly, and wake up screaming, sweating andpanicked. The episode may last anywhere from five to 20minutes. During this time, the individual is actuallyasleep, although the eyes may open. Quite often, nothingcan be done to comfort the affected person. Very often,the person has no memory of the episode upon wakingthe next day.\\nNight terrors are differentiated from nightmares in\\nthat they have been shown to occur during Stage 4 ofsleep, or in REM sleep, while nightmares can occur any-time throughout the sleep cycle.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSuffering from night terrors seems to run in families.\\nExtreme tension or stress can increase the incidence of\\nthe episodes. In adults, the use of alcohol also contributesto an increased incidence of night terrors. Episodessometimes occur after an accident involving head\\ninjury . Other factors thought to contribute to episodic\\nnight terrors, but not actually cause them, include:\\n• medications\\n• excessive tiredness at bedtime• eating a heavy meal prior to bedtime\\n• drug abuse\\nDiagnosis\\nNight terrors are primarily diagnosed by observing\\nthe person suffering from an episode. The followingsymptoms are characteristic of a person suffering from anight terror:\\n• panic• sweating\\n• gasping, moaning, crying or screaming during sleep\\n• little or no recollection of the episode upon awakening\\nTreatment\\nIn most cases, the individual will still be asleep as\\nthe night terror episode happens and will prove difficultto awaken. The goal should be to help the affected persongo back into a calm state of sleep. The lights should beturned on, and soothing comments should be directed atthe person, avoiding brusque gestures such as shakingthe person or shouting to startle them out of the episode.Any form of stress should be avoided.\\nIndividuals affected by night terrors should be evalu-\\nated by a physician if they are really severe and occurfrequently.

The physician may also referthe affected person for further evaluation by a sleep dis-order specialist. It should be noted that episodic nightterrors in children are normal and do not suggest thepresence of psychological problems. In adults, night ter-rors are more likely to be related to a significant stress-related or emotional problem.\\nPrognosis\\nIn children, night terror episodes in children usually\\nend by the age of 12.\\nPrevention\\nIf a child seems to have a regular pattern of night ter-\\nror episodes, he should be gently awakened about 15minutes before the episode usually happens. The childshould be kept awake and out of the bed for a short peri-od of time and then allowed to return to bed.\\nSince sleep deprivation is a strong trigger for night\\nterror episodes, children should not be allowed tobecome overtired. Having children take a nap during theday may be useful.\\nAdults affected by night terror episodes should\\navoid stress, the consumption of alcohol and stimulantsbefore going to sleep.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBerkow, Robert.

When divers go below depthsof approximately 100 ft, increase in the partial pressureof nitrogen produces an altered mental state similar toalcohol intoxication.\\nDescription\\nNitrogen narcosis, commonly referred to as “rapture\\nof the deep,” typically becomes noticeable at 100 ftunderwater and is incapacitating at 300 ft, causing stu-por, blindness, unconsciousness, and even death . Nitro-\\ngen narcosis is also called “the martini effect” becausedivers experience an effect comparable to that from onemartini on an empty stomach for every 50 ft of depthbeyond the initial 100 ft.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nNitrogen narcosis is caused by gases in the body act-\\ning in a manner described by Dalton’s Law of partialpressures: the total pressure of a gas mixture is equal tothe sum of the partial pressures of gases in the mixture.As the total gas pressure increases with increasing divedepth, the partial pressure of nitrogen increases and morenitrogen becomes dissolved in the blood. This high nitro-gen concentration impairs the conduction of nerveimpulses and mimics the effects of alcohol or narcotics.\\nSymptoms of nitrogen narcosis include: wooziness;\\ngiddiness; euphoria; disorientation; loss of balance; lossof manual dexterity; slowing of reaction time; fixation ofideas; and impairment of complex reasoning.

Nitrogennarcosis may be differentiated from toxicity of oxygen,carbon monoxide, or carbon dioxide by the absence ofsuch symptoms as headache , seizure, and bluish color of\\nthe lips and nail beds.\\nTreatment\\nThe effects of nitrogen narcosis are totally reversed\\nas the gas pressure decreases. They are typically gone bythe time the diver returns to a water depth of 60 ft. Nitro-gen narcosis has no hangover or lasting effects requiringfurther treatment. However, a doctor should be consultedwhenever a diver has lost consciousness.\\nPrognosis\\nWhen a diver returns to a safe depth, the effects of\\nnitrogen narcosis disappear completely. Some evidenceexists that certain divers may become partially acclimat-ed to the effects of nitrogen narcosis with frequency—the more often they dive, the less the increased nitrogenseems to affect them.\\nPrevention\\nHelium may be used as a substitute for nitrogen to\\ndilute oxygen for deep water diving. It is colorless, odor-less, tasteless, and chemically inert. However, it is moreexpensive than nitrogen and drains body heat from adiver. In diving with rapid compression, the helium-oxy-gen mixture may produce nausea, dizziness , and trem-\\nbling, but these adverse reactions are less severe thannitrogen narcosis.\\nNitrogen narcosis can be avoided by limiting the\\ndepth of dives. The risk of nitrogen narcosis may also beminimized by following safe diving practices, includingproper equipment maintenance, low work effort, properbuoyancy, maintenance of visual cues, and focusedthinking. In addition, no alcohol should be consumedwithin 24 hours of diving.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nMartin, Lawrence.

Always take nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory drugs exactly as directed. If using non-prescription (over-the-counter) types, follow the direc-tions on the package label. For prescription types, checkwith the physician who prescribed the medicine or thepharmacist who filled the prescription. Never take largeror more frequent doses, and do not take the drug forlonger than directed. Patients who take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for severe arthritis must take themregularly over a long time. Several weeks may be neededto feel the results, so it is important to keep taking themedicine, even if it does not seem to be working at first.\\nWhen taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in\\ntablet, capsule, or caplet form, always take them with a full,8-ounce glass of water or milk. Taking these drugs withfood or an antacid will help prevent stomach irritation.\\nPrecautions\\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can cause a\\nnumber of side effects, some of which may be very seri-ous (See Side effects). These side effects are more likelywhen the drugs are taken in large doses or for a long timeor when two or more nonsteroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs are taken together. Health care professionals canhelp patients weigh the risks of benefits of taking thesemedicines for long periods.\\nDo not take acetaminophen ,aspirin , or other sali-\\ncylates along with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs for more than a few days unless directed to do soby a physician. Do not take ketorolac (Toradol) whiletaking other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs unlessdirected to do so by a physician.\\nBecause older people are more sensitive than\\nyounger adults to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,they may be more likely to have side effects. Some sideeffects, such as stomach problems, may also be moreserious in older people.\\nSerious side effects are especially likely with one\\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, phenylbutazone.Patients age 40 and over are especially at risk of sideeffects from this drug, and the likelihood of serious sideeffects increases with age. Because of these potentialproblems, it is especially important to check with aphysician before taking this medicine. Never take it foranything other than the condition for which it was pre-scribed, and never share it—or any other prescriptiondrug—with another person.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2361Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs'),\n",

Persistent bleeding should always be investigatedbecause it may be the earliest sign of cancer . Fortunate-\\nly, nosebleeds are rarely a sign of cancer. A much morecommon cause of nosebleeds is injury from picking orblowing or fisticuffs. People with hay fever have swollen\\nmembranes that are fragile and more likely to bleed.\\nNosebleeds most often come from the front of the\\nseptum, that plane of cartilage that separates the nostrils.It has a mass of blood vessels on either side called Kies-selbach’s plexus that is easy to injure. Nosebleeds fromthe more remote reaches of the nose are less commonand much harder to manage.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCancers are an uncommon cause of nosebleeds, but\\nby far the most serious. Injury from fists, fingers, and overzealous nose blowing leads the list. Tumors from the frontof the brain may break through into the sinuses or theback of the nose. Bleeding may be a trickle or a flood.\\nTreatment\\nThe first treatment is to pinch the nostrils together,\\nsit forward and stay that way for 5-10 minutes. Bleedingthat continues will be from the back of the nose and willflow down the throat. If that happens, emergency inter-vention is needed.\\nAs an emergency procedure, the nose will be packed\\nfront and/or back with cotton cloth and a rubber balloon.This is not comfortable. Having no place to flow, the bloodshould clot, giving the ear, nose and throat specialists(otorhinolaryngologists) a chance to find the source and per-manently repair it. If the packing has to remain for anylength of time, antibiotics and pain medication will be nec-\\nessary—antibiotics because the sinuses will be plugged upand prone to infection. Nose packing may so interfere withbreathing that the patient will need supplemental oxygen.\\nMany bleeds are from small exposed blood vessels with\\nno other disease. They can be destroyed by cautery (burningwith electricity or chemicals). Larger vessels may notrespond to cautery. The surgeon may have to tie them off.\\nAlternative treatment\\nEstrogen cream, the same preparation used to revital-\\nize vaginal tissue, can toughen fragile blood vessels in theanterior septum and forestall the need for cauterization.Botanical medicines known as stiptics, which slow downand can stop bleeding, may be taken internally or appliedtopically. Some of the plants used are achillea (yarrow),trillium, geranium, and shepard’s purse ( capsella-bursa ).\\nHomeopathic remedies can be one of the quickest andmost effective treatments for epistaxis. One well knownremedy for nosebleeds is phosphorus.\\nPrevention\\nBoth before and after a nosebleed, blow gently and\\ndo not pick.

This same combination of numbness and tinglingcan occur in any region of the body and may be causedby a wide variety of disorders. Sensations such as these,which occur without any associated stimulus, are calledparesthesias. Other types of paresthesias include feelingsof cold, warmth, burning, itching , and skin crawling.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nSensation is carried to the brain by neurons (nerve\\ncells) running from the outer parts of the body to thespinal cord in bundles called nerves. In the spinal cord,these neurons make connections with other neurons thatrun up to the brain. Paresthesias are caused by distur-bances in the function of neurons in the sensory pathway.This disturbance can occur in the central nervous system(the brain and spinal cord), the nerve roots that areattached to the spinal cord, or the peripheral nervous sys-tem (nerves outside the brain and spinal cord).\\nPeripheral disturbances are the most common cause\\nof paresthesias. “Falling asleep” occurs when the bloodsupply to a nerve is cut off—a condition called ischemia .\\nIschemia usually occurs when an artery is compressed asit passes through a tightly flexed joint. Sleeping with thearms above the head or sitting with the legs tightlycrossed frequently cause numbness and tingling.\\nDirect compression of the nerve also causes pares-\\nthesias. Compression can be short-lived, as when a heavybackpack compresses the nerves passing across theshoulders. Compression may also be chronic. Chronicnerve compression occurs in entrapment syndromes. Themost common example is carpal tunnel syndrome .\\nCarpal tunnel syndrome occurs when the median nerve iscompressed as it passes through a narrow channel in thewrist. Repetitive motion or prolonged vibration cancause the lining of the channel to swell and press on thenerve. Chronic nerve root compression, or radiculopathy,can occur in disk disease or spinal arthritis.\\nOther causes of paresthesias related to disorders of\\nthe peripheral nerves include:\\n• Metabolic or nutritional disturbances. These distur-\\nbances include diabetes, hypothyroidism (a condition\\ncaused by too little activity of the thyroid gland), alco-\\nholism ,malnutrition , and vitamin B\\n12deficiency.\\n• Trauma. Trauma includes injuries that crush, sever, or\\npull on nerves.\\n• Inflammation.• Connective tissue disease. These diseases include arthritis,\\nsystemic lupus erythematosus (a chronic inflammatory\\ndisease that affects many systems of the body, includingthe nervous system), polyarteritis nodosa (a vascular dis-ease that causes widespread inflammation and ischemia ofsmall and medium-size arteries), and Sjögren’s syn-\\ndrome (a disorder marked by insufficient moisture in the\\ntear ducts, salivary glands, and other glands).\\n• Toxins. Toxins include heavy metals (metallic elements\\nsuch as arsenic, lead, and mercury which can, in largeamounts, cause poisoning ), certain antibiotics and\\nchemotherapy agents, solvents, and overdose of pyri-\\ndoxine (vitamin B\\n6).\\n• Malignancy.• Infections. Infections include Lyme disease , human\\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV), and leprosy.\\n• Hereditary disease. These diseases include Charcot-\\nMarie-Tooth disease (a hereditary disorder that causes\\nwasting of the leg muscles, resulting in malformation ofthe foot), porphyria (a group of inherited disorders inwhich there is abnormally increased production of sub-stances called porphyrins), and Denny-Brown’s syn-drome (a hereditary disorder of the nerve root).\\nParesthesias can also be caused by central nervous\\nsystem disturbances, including stroke , TIA ( transient\\nischemic attack ), tumor, trauma, multiple sclerosis ,o r\\ninfection.\\nSymptoms\\nSensory nerves supply or innervate particular regions\\nof the body. Determining the distribution of symptoms isan important way to identify the nerves involved. Forinstance, the median nerve innervates the thumb, the firsttwo fingers, half of the ring finger, and the part of thehand to which they connect. The ulnar nerve innervatesthe other half of the ring finger, the little finger, and theremainder of the hand. Distribution of symptoms mayalso aid diagnosis of the underlying disease. Diabetesusually causes a symmetrical “glove and stocking” distri-bution in the hands and feet. Multiple sclerosis may causesymptoms in several, widely separated areas.\\nOther symptoms may accompany paresthesias,\\ndepending on the type and severity of the nerve distur-bance. For instance, weakness may accompany damageto nerves that carry both sensory and motor neurons.(Motor neurons are those that carry messages outwardfrom the brain.)\\nDiagnosis\\nA careful history of the patient is needed for a diag-\\nnosis of paresthesias.

The\\nhistory may also reveal current related medical problemsand recent or past exposure to drugs, toxins, infection, ortrauma. The family medical history may suggest a famil-ial disorder. A work history may reveal repetitive motion,chronic vibration, or industrial chemical exposure.\\nThe physical and neurological examination tests for\\ndistribution of symptoms and alterations in reflexes, sen-sation, or strength. The distribution of symptoms may bemapped by successive stimulation over the affected areaof the body.\\nLab tests for paresthesia may include blood tests and\\nurinalysis to detect metabolic or nutritional abnormalities.\\nOther tests are used to look for specific suspected causes.Nerve conduction velocity tests, electromyography , and\\nimaging studies of the affected area may be employed.Nerve biopsy may be indicated in selected cases.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of paresthesias depends on the underlying\\ncause. For limbs that have “fallen asleep,” restoring cir-culation by stretching, exercising, or massaging theaffected limb can quickly dissipate the numbness and tin-gling. If the paresthesia is caused by a chronic diseasesuch as diabetes or occurs as a complication of treat-ments such as chemotherapy, most treatments are aimedat relieving symptoms. Anti-inflammatory drugs such asaspirin or ibuprofen are recommended if symptoms are\\nmild. In more difficult cases, antidepressant drugs such\\nas amitriptyline (Elavil) are sometimes prescribed. Thesedrugs are given at a much lower dosage for this purposethan for relief of depression. They are thought to helpbecause they alter the body’s perception of pain . In\\nsevere cases, opium derivatives such as codeine can beprescribed. Currently trials are being done to determinewhether treatment with human nerve growth factor willbe effective in regenerating the damaged nerves.\\nAlternative treatment\\nSeveral alternative treatments are available to help\\nrelieve symptoms of paresthesia. Nutritional therapyincludes supplementation with B complex vitamins ,\\nespecially vitamin B\\n12(intramuscular injection of vita-\\nmin B12is most effective). Vitamin supplements should\\nbe used cautiously however. Overdose of Vitamin B6is\\none of the causes of paresthesias. People experiencingparesthesia should also avoid alcohol. Acupuncture and\\nmassage are said to relieve symptoms. Self-massage witharomatic oils is sometimes helpful. The application oftopical ointments containing capsaicin, the substancethat makes hot peppers hot, provides relief for some.

There are six categories of nutrients that the bodyneeds to acquire from food: protein, carbohydrates, fat,fibers, vitamins and minerals , and water.\\nProteins\\nProtein supplies amino acids to build and maintain\\nhealthy body tissue. There are 20 amino acids consideredessential because the body must have all of them in theright amounts to function properly. Twelve of these aremanufactured in the body but the other eight amino acidsmust be provided by the diet. Foods from animal sourcesuch as milk or eggs often contain all these essential aminoacids while a variety of plant products must be takentogether to provide all these necessary protein components.\\nFat\\nFat supplies energy and transports nutrients. There\\nare two families of fatty acids considered essential for thebody: the omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Essentialfatty acids are required by the body to function normally.They can be obtained from canola oil, flaxseed oil, cold-water fish, or fish oil, all of which contain omega-3 fattyacids, and primrose or black currant seed oil, which con-tains omega-6 fatty acids. The American diet often con-tains excess of omega-6 fatty acids and insufficientamount of omega-3 fats. Increased consumption ofomega-3 oils are recommended to help reduce risk of car-diovascular diseases and cancer and alleviate symptoms\\nof rheumatoid arthritis ,premenstrual syndrome ,der-\\nmatitis , and inflammatory bowel disease.\\nCarbohydrates\\nCarbohydrates are the body’s main source of energy\\nand should be the major part of total daily intake. Thereare two types of carbohydrates: simple carbohydrates(such as sugar or honey) or complex carbohydrates (suchas grains, beans, peas, or potatoes). Complex carbohy-drates are preferred because these foods are more nutri-tious yet have fewer calories per gram compared to fatand cause fewer problems with overeating than fat orsugar. Complex carbohydrates are also preferred oversimple carbohydrates by diabetics because they allowbetter blood glucose control.\\nFiber\\nFiber is the material that gives plant texture and sup-\\nport. Although it is primarily made up of carbohydrates,it does not have a lot of calories and usually is not brokendown by the body for energy. Dietary fiber is found inplant foods such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, andwhole grains.\\nThere are two types of fiber: soluble and insoluble.\\nInsoluble fiber, as the name implies, does not dissolve inwater because it contains high amount of cellulose.Insoluble fiber can be found in the bran of grains, thepulp of fruit and the skin of vegetables. Soluble fiber isthe type of fiber that dissolves in water. It can be found ina variety of fruits and vegetables such as apples, oatmealand oat bran, rye flour, and dried beans.\\nAlthough they share some common characteristics\\nsuch as being partially digested in the stomach andintestines and have few calories, each type of fiber has itsown specific health benefits. Insoluble fiber speeds upthe transit of foods through the digestive system and addsbulk to the stools, therefore, it is the type of fiber thathelps treat constipation or diarrhea and prevents colon\\ncancer . On the other hand, only soluble fiber can lower\\nblood cholesterol levels. This type of fiber works byattaching itself to the cholesterol so that it can be elimi-nated from the body. This prevents cholesterol from re-circulating and being reabsorbed into the bloodstream.\\nVitamins and minerals\\nVitamins are organic substances present in food and\\nrequired by the body in a minute amount for regulation ofmetabolism and maintenance of normal growth and func-tioning. The most commonly known vitamins are A, B\\n1\\n(thiamine), B2(riboflavin), B3(niacin), B5(pantothenic\\nacid), B6(pyridoxine), B7(biotin), B9(folic acid ), B12\\n(cobalamin), C (ascorbic acid), D, E, and K. The B and C\\nvitamins are water-soluble, excess amounts of which areexcreted in the urine. The A, D, E, and K vitamins are fat-soluble and will be stored in the body fat.\\nMinerals are vital to our existence because they are\\nthe building blocks that make up muscles, tissues, andbones. They also are important components of many life-supporting systems, such as hormones, oxygen transport,and enzyme systems.\\nThere are two kinds of minerals: the major (or\\nmacro) minerals and the trace minerals. Major mineralsare the minerals that the body needs in large amount. Thefollowing minerals are classified as major: calcium,phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium, sulfur, andchloride. They are needed to build muscles, blood, nervecells, teeth, and bones. They are also essential elec-trolytes that the body requires to regulate blood volumeand acid-base balance.\\nUnlike the major minerals, trace minerals are needed\\nonly in tiny amounts. Even though they can be found in\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2367Nutrition'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 74}, page_content='the body in exceedingly small amounts, they are also\\nvery important to the human body. These minerals partic-ipate in most chemical reactions in the body. They arealso needed to manufacture important hormones. Thefollowing are classified as trace minerals: iron, zinc,iodine, copper, manganese, fluoride, chromium, seleni-um, molybdenum, and boron.\\nMany vitamins (such as vitamins A, C, and E) and\\nminerals (such as zinc, copper, selenium, or manganese)act as antioxidants. They protect the body against thedamaging effects of free radicals. They scavenge or mopup these highly reactive radicals and change them intoinactive, less harmful compounds. In so doing, theseessential nutrients help prevent cancer and many otherdegenerative diseases, such as premature aging , heart\\ndisease, autoimmune diseases, arthritis, cataracts ,\\nAlzheimer’s disease , and diabetes mellitus .\\nWater\\nWater helps to regulate body temperature, transports\\nnutrients to cells, and rids the body of waste materials.\\nOrigins\\nUnlike plants, human beings cannot manufacture\\nmost of the nutrients that they need to function. Theymust eat plants and/or other animals. Although nutrition-al therapy came to the forefront of the public’s awarenessin the late twentieth century, the notion that food affectshealth is not new. John Harvey Kellogg was an earlyhealth-food pioneer and an advocate of a high-fiber diet.An avowed vegetarian, he believed that meat productswere particularly detrimental to the colon. In the 1870s,Kellogg founded the Battle Creek Sanitarium, where hedeveloped a diet based on nut and vegetable products.\\nPurpose\\nGood nutrition helps individuals achieve general\\nhealth and well-being. In addition, dietary modificationsmight be prescribed for a variety of complaints includingallergies , anemia, arthritis, colds, depressions, fatigue ,\\ngastrointestinal disorder, high or low blood pressure,insomnia , headaches, obesity ,pregnancy , premenstrual\\nsyndrome (PMS), respiratory conditions, and stress .\\nNutritional therapy may also be involved as a com-\\nplement to the allopathic treatments of cancer, diabetes,and Parkinson’s disease . Other specific dietary mea-\\nsures include the elimination of food additives for atten-tion deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ), gluten-free\\ndiets for schizophrenia , and dairy-free for chronic respi-\\nratory diseases.A high-fiber diet helps prevent or treat the following\\nhealth conditions:\\n• High cholesterol levels. Fiber effectively lowers blood\\ncholesterol levels. It appears that soluble fiber binds tocholesterol and moves it down the digestive tract so thatit can be excreted from the body. This prevents the cho-lesterol from being reabsorbed into the bloodstream.\\n• Constipation. A high-fiber diet is the preferred non-\\ndrug treatment for constipation. Fiber in the diet addsmore bulk to the stools, making them softer and short-ens the time foods stay in the digestive tract.\\n• Hemorrhoids. Fiber in the diet adds more bulk and soft-\\nens the stool, thus, reducing painful hemorrhoidalsymptoms.\\n• Diabetes. Soluble fiber in the diet slows down the rise\\nof blood sugar levels following a meal and helps con-trol diabetes.\\n• Obesity. Dietary fiber makes a person feel full faster.• Cancer. Insoluble fiber in the diet speeds up the move-\\nment of the stools through the gastro-intestinal tract.The faster food travels through the digestive tract, theless time there is for potential cancer-causing sub-stances to work. Therefore, diets high in insoluble fiberhelp prevent the accumulation of toxic substances thatcause cancer of the colon. Because fiber reduces fatabsorption in the digestive tract, it may also preventbreast cancer .\\nA diet low in fat also promotes good health and pre-\\nvents many diseases. Low-fat diet can help treat or con-trol the following conditions:\\n• Obesity. High fat consumption often leads to excess\\ncaloric and fat intake, which increases body fat.\\n• Coronary artery disease. High consumption of saturat-\\ned fats is associated with coronary artery disease.\\n• Diabetes. People who are overweight tend to develop or\\nworsen existing diabetic condition due to decreasedinsulin sensitivity.\\n• Breast cancer. A high dietary consumption of fat is\\nassociated with an increased risk of breast cancer.\\nDescription\\nThe four basic food groups, as outlined by the Unit-\\ned States Department of Agriculture (USDA) are:\\n• dairy products (such as milk and cheese)\\n• meat and eggs (such as fish, poultry, pork, beef, and\\neggs)\\n• grains (such as bread cereals, rice, and pasta)• fruits and vegetables\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2368Nutrition'),\n",

The rest (80%)should be devoted to vegetables, fruits, and grains. Forchildren age two or older, 55% of their caloric intakeshould be in the form of carbohydrates, 30% from fat,and 15% from proteins. In addition, saturated fat intakeshould not exceed 10% of total caloric intake. This low-fat, high-fiber diet is believed to promote health and helpprevent many diseases, including heart disease, obesity,and cancer.\\nAllergenic and highly processed foods should be\\navoided.

Mainstream Western medical practitionerspoint to studies that show that a balanced diet, based onthe USDA Food Guide Pyramid, provides all of the nec-essary nutrients.\\nThe Food Guide Pyramid recommends the following\\ndaily servings in six categories:\\n• grains: six or more servings\\n• vegetables: five servings\\n• fruits: two to four servings\\n• meat: two to three servings\\n• dairy: two to three servings\\n• fats and oils: use sparingly\\nPrecautions\\nIndividuals should not change their diets without the\\nadvice of nutritional experts or health care professionals.Certain individuals especially children, pregnant and lac-tating women, and chronically ill patients should onlychange their diets under professional supervision.\\nSide effects\\nIt is best to obtain vitamins and minerals through\\nfood sources. Excessive intake of vitamins and mineralsupplements can cause serious physiological problems.The following is a list of possible side effects result-\\ning from excessive doses of vitamins and minerals:\\n• vitamin A: birth defects , irreversible bone and liver\\ndamage\\n• vitamin B\\n1: deficiencies in B2and B6\\n• vitamin B6: damage to the nervous system\\n• vitamin C: affects the absorption of copper; diarrhea\\n• vitamin D: hypercalcemia (abnormally high concen-\\ntration of calcium in the blood)\\n• phosphorus: affects the absorption of calcium• zinc: affects absorption of copper and iron; suppresses\\nthe immune system\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nDue to large volume of scientific evidence demon-\\nstrating the benefits of the low-fat, high-fiber diet in dis-ease prevention and treatment, this diet has been accept-ed and advocated by both complementary and allopathicpractitioners.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBruce, Debra Fulghum, and Harris H.

Thesepatients may require a central venous access port. A spe-\\ncialized catheter (Silastic Broviac or Hickman) is insertedbeneath the skin and positioned below the collarbone.Fluids can then be injected directly into the bloodstreamfor long periods of time. X rays are taken to ensure thatthe move permanent catheter is properly positioned.\\nPrecautions\\nPatients receiving IV therapy need to be monitored\\nto ensure that the IV solutions are providing the correctamounts of fluids, minerals , and other nutrients needed.\\nDescription\\nThere are two types of IV , or parenteral, nutrition .\\nParenteral nutrition is that which is delivered through asystem other than the digestive system. In this case, thenutrition is delivered through a vein. Partial parenteralnutrition (PPN) is given for short periods of time, toreplace some of the nutrients required daily and onlysupplements a normal diet. Total parenteral nutrition(TPN) is given to someone who cannot eat anything andmust receive all nutrients required daily through an intra-venous line. Both of these types of nutrition can be per-formed in a medical facility or at the patient’s home.Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) usually required a cen-tral venous catheter, which must first be inserted in afully equiped medical facility. After it is inserted, therapycan continue at home.\\nBasic IV solutions are sterile water with small\\namounts of sodium (salt) or dextrose (sugar) supplied inbottles or thick plastic bags that can hang on a standmounted next to the patient’s bed. Additional minerals,like potassium and calcium, vitamins , or drugs can be\\nadded to the IV solution by injecting them into the bottleor bag with a needle. These simple sugar and salt solu-tions can provide fluids, calories, and electrolytes neces-sary for short periods of time. If a patient requires intra-venous feeding for more than a few days, additionalnutrients like proteins and fats will be included. Theamounts of each of the nutrients to be added will dependon the patient’s age, medical condition, and particularnutritional requirements.\\nPreparation\\nA doctor orders the IV solution and any additional\\nnutrients or drugs to be added to it. The doctor also spec-ifies the rate at which the IV will be infused. The IVsolutions are prepared under the supervision of a doctor,pharmacist, or nurse, using sanitary techniques that pre-vent bacterial contamination. Just like a prescription, theIV is clearly labeled to show its contents and the amountsof any additives. The skin around the area where the nee-dle is inserted is cleaned and sanitized. Once the needleis in place, it will be taped to the skin to prevent it fromdislodging.\\nIn the case of HPN, the IV solution is delivered to\\nthe patient’s home on a regular basis and should be keptrefrigerated. Each bag will have an expiration date, bywhich time the bag should be used. The solution shouldbe allowed to be warmed to room temperature beforeintravenous nutrition begins.\\nAftercare\\nPatients who have been on IV therapy for more than\\na few days may need to have foods reintroduced gradual-ly to give the digestive tract time to start working again.After the IV needle is removed, the site should beinspected for any signs of bleeding or infection.\\nWhen using HPN, the catheter should be kept clean\\nat all times. The dressings around the site should bechanged at least once a week and the catheter site shouldbe monitored closely for signs of redness, swelling, anddrainage. The patient’s extremities should be watched forswelling, which is a sign of nutritional imbalance.\\nRisks\\nThere is a risk of infection at the injection site, and\\nfor patients on long term IV therapy, the risk of an infec-tion spreading to the entire body is fairly high.

If\\nthe needle becomes dislodged, it is possible that the solu-tion may flow into tissues around the injection site ratherthan into the vein. The patient should be monitored regu-larly, particulary if receiving HPN, as intravenous nutri-tion can potentially cause infection at the site of thecatheter, high blood sugar, and low blood potassium,which can all be life-threatening.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHoward, Lyn. “Enteral and Parenteral Nutrition Therapy.” In\\nHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine , ed.

The to-and-fro motion is generally involun-tary. Vertical nystagmus occurs much less frequently thanhorizontal nystagmus and is often, but not necessarily, asign of serious brain damage. Nystagmus can be a normalphysiological response or a result of a pathologic problem.\\nDescription\\nThe eyes play a critical role in maintaining balance.\\nThey are directly connected to other organs of equilibri-um, most important of which is the inner ear. Paired struc-tures called the semicircular canals deep in the skullbehind the ears sense motion and relay that information tobalance control centers in the brain. The eyes send visualinformation to the same centers. A third set of sensorsconsists of nerve endings all over the body, particularly injoints, that detect position. All this information is integrat-ed to allow the body to navigate in space and gravity.\\nIt is possible to fool this system or to overload it\\nwith information so that it malfunctions. A spinning rideat the amusement park is a good way to overload it withinformation. The system has adapted to the spinning,expects it to go on forever, and carries that momentumfor some time after it is over. Nystagmus is the lingeringadjustment of the eyes to tracking the world as it revolvesaround them.\\nNystagmus can be classified depending upon the\\ntype of motion of the eyes. In pendular nystagmus thespeed of motion of the eyes is the same in both direc-tions. In jerk nystagmus there is a slow and fast phase.The eyes move slowly in one direction and then seem tojerk back in the other direction.\\nNystagmus can be present at birth (congenital) or\\nacquired later on in life. A certain type of acquired nys-tagmus, called spasmus nutans, includes a head tilt andhead bobbing and generally occurs between four to 12months of age. It may last a few months to a few years,but generally goes away by itself.\\nRailway nystagmus is a physiological type of nys-\\ntagmus. It happens when someone is on a moving train(thus the term railway) and is watching a stationaryobject which appears to be going by. The eyes slowly fol-low the object and then quickly jerk back to start over.Railway nystagmus (also called optokinetic nystagmus)is a type of jerk nystagmus. This phenomenon can beused to check vision in infants. Nystagmus can also beinduced by fooling the semicircular canals. Caloric stim-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2371Nystagmus'),\n",

Cold orwarm water flushed into the ear canal will generatemotion signals from the inner ear. The eyes will respondto this signal with nystagmus if the pathways are intact.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are many causes of nystagmus. Nystagmus\\nmay be present at birth. It may be a result of the lack ofdevelopment of normal binocular fixation early on in life.This can occur if there is a cataract at birth or a problem issome other part of the visual system. Some other condi-tions that nystagmus may be associated with include:\\n• Albinism. This condition is caused by a decrease in pig-\\nmentation and may affect the eyes.\\n• Disorders of the eyes. This may include optic atrophy ,\\ncolor blindness , very high nearsightedness ( myopia )\\nor severe astigmatism , or opacities in the structures of\\nthe eyes.\\n• Acute labyrinthitis . This is an inflammation in the\\ninner ear. The patient may have dizziness (vertigo),\\nnausea and vomiting , and nystagmus.\\n• Brain lesions. Disease in many parts of the brain can\\nresult in nystagmus.\\n• Alcohol and drugs. Alcohol and some medications (e.g.,\\nanti-epilepsy medications) can induce or exaggeratenystagmus.KEY TERMS\\nBinocular fixation —Both eye pointed to and look-\\ning at the same object.\\nCataract —A clouding of the lens of the eye.\\nOptic atrophy —Degeneration of the optic nerve.\\nSemicircular canals —Structures of the inner ear\\nthat help in maintaining balance.\\nVertigo —A sense of spinning usually accompa-\\nnied by unsteadiness and nausea.• Multiple sclerosis. A disease of the central nervous sys-\\ntem.\\nDiagnosis\\nNystagmus is a sign, not a disease. If abnormal, it\\nindicates a problem in one of the systems controlling it.An ophthalmologist and/or neuro-ophthalmologistshould be consulted.\\nTreatment\\nThere is one kind of nystagmus that seems to occur\\nharmlessly by itself. The condition, benign positionalvertigo, produces vertigo and nystagmus when the headis moved in certain directions. It can arise spontaneouslyor after a concussion . Motion sickness medicines some-\\ntimes help. But the reaction will dissipate if continuouslyevoked. Each morning a patient is asked to produce thesymptom by moving his or her head around until it nolonger happens. This prevents it from returning for sever-al hours or the entire day.\\nPrisms, contact lenses, eyeglasses, or eye muscle\\nsurgery are some possible treatments. These therapies\\nmay reduce the nystagmus but may not alleviate it.Again, because nystagmus may be a symptom, it isimportant to determine the cause.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBennett, J.

Obesity is associated with increased risk of ill-ness, disability, and death .\\nDescription\\nObesity traditionally has been defined as a weight at\\nleast 20% above the weight corresponding to the lowestdeath rate for individuals of a specific height, gender, andage (ideal weight). Twenty to forty percent over idealweight is considered mildly obese; 40–100% over idealweight is considered moderately obese; and 100% overideal weight is considered severely, or morbidly, obese.More recent guidelines for obesity use a measurmentcalled BMI (body mass index) which is the individual’sweight multiplied by 703 and then divided by twice theheight in inches. BMI of 25.9–29 is considered over-weight; BMI over 30 is considered obese. Measurementsand comparisons of waist and hip circumference can alsoprovide some information regarding risk factors associat-ed with weight. The higher the ratio, the greater thechance for weight-associated complications. Caliperscan be used to measure skin-fold thickness to determinewhether tissue is muscle (lean) or adipose tissue (fat).\\nMuch concern has been generated about the increas-\\ning incidence of obesity among Americans. Some studieshave noted an increase from 12% to 18% occurringbetween 1991 and 1998. Other studies have actually esti-mated that a full 50% of all Americans are overweight.The World Health Organization terms obesity a world-wide epidemic, and the diseases which can occur due toobesity are becoming increasingly prevalent.\\nExcessive weight can result in many serious, poten-\\ntially life-threatening health problems, including hyper-\\ntension , Type II diabetes mellitus (non-insulin depen-dent diabetes), increased risk for coronary disease,\\nincreased unexplained heart attack , hyperlipidemia,\\ninfertility , and a higher prevalence of colon, prostate,\\nendometrial, and, possibly, breast cancer . Approximate-\\nly 300,000 deaths a year are attributed to obesity, prompt-ing leaders in public health, such as former Surgeon Gen-eral C. Everett Koop, M.D., to label obesity “the secondleading cause of preventable deaths in the United States.”\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe mechanism for excessive weight gain is clear—\\nmore calories are consumed than the body burns , and the\\nexcess calories are stored as fat (adipose) tissue. Howev-er, the exact cause is not as clear and likely arises from acomplex combination of factors. Genetic factors signifi-cantly influence how the body regulates the appetite andthe rate at which it turns food into energy (metabolicrate). Studies of adoptees confirm this relationship—themajority of adoptees followed a pattern of weight gainthat more closely resembled that of their birth parentsthan their adoptive parents. A genetic predisposition toweight gain, however, does not automatically mean that aperson will be obese. Eating habits and patterns of physi-cal activity also play a significant role in the amount ofweight a person gains. Recent studies have indicated thatthe amount of fat in a person’s diet may have a greaterimpact on weight than the number of calories it contains.Carbohydrates like cereals, breads, fruits, and vegetablesand protein (fish, lean meat, turkey breast, skim milk) areconverted to fuel almost as soon as they are consumed.Most fat calories are immediately stored in fat cells,which add to the body’s weight and girth as they expandand multiply. A sedentary lifestyle, particularly prevalentin affluent societies, such as in the United States, cancontribute to weight gain. Psychological factors, such asdepression and low self-esteem may, in some cases, alsoplay a role in weight gain.\\nAt what stage of life a person becomes obese can\\neffect his or her ability to lose weight. In childhood,O\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2373'),\n",

Since dieting and exercise can only reduce the\\nsize of fat cells, not eliminate them, persons who wereobese as children can have great difficulty losing weight,since they may have up to five times as many fat cells assomeone who became overweight as an adult.\\nObesity can also be a side-effect of certain disorders\\nand conditions, including:\\n• cushing’s syndrome, a disorder involving the excessive\\nrelease of the hormone cortisol\\n• hypothyroidism, a condition caused by an underactive\\nthyroid gland\\n• neurologic disturbances, such as damage to the hypo-\\nthalamus, a structure located deep within the brain thathelps regulate appetite\\n• consumption of certain drugs, such as steroids or anti-\\ndepressants\\nThe major symptoms of obesity are excessive\\nweight gain and the presence of large amounts of fattytissue. Obesity can also give rise to several secondaryconditions, including:\\n• arthritis and other orthopedic problems, such as lower\\nback pain\\n• hernias• heartburn\\n• adult-onset asthma\\n• gum disease• high cholesterol levels\\n• gallstones\\n• high blood pressure• menstrual irregularities or cessation of menstruation\\n(amenorhhea)\\n• decreased fertility, and pregnancy complications\\n• shortness of breath that can be incapacitating\\n• sleep apnea and sleeping disorders\\n• skin disorders, arising from the bacterial breakdown of\\nsweat and cellular material in thick folds of skin orfrom increased friction between folds\\n• emotional and social problems\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of obesity is made by observation and by\\ncomparing the patient’s weight to ideal weight charts.Many doctors and obesity researchers refer to the bodymass index (BMI), which uses a height-weight relation-\\nship to calculate an individual’s ideal weight and person-al risk of developing obesity-related health problems.Physicians may also obtain direct measurements of anindividual’s body fat content by using calipers to mea-sure skin-fold thickness at the back of the upper arm andother sites. The most accurate means of measuring bodyfat content involves immersing a person in water andmeasuring relative displacement; however, this method isvery impractical and is usually only used in scientificstudies requiring very specific assessments. Womenwhose body fat exceeds 30% and men whose body fatexceeds 25% are generally considered obese.\\nDoctors may also note how a person carries excess\\nweight on his or her body. Studies have shown that thisfactor may indicate whether or not an individual has apredisposition to develop certain diseases or conditionsthat may accompany obesity. “Apple-shaped” individualswho store most of their weight around the waist andabdomen are at greater risk for cancer , heart disease,\\nstroke , and diabetes than “pear-shaped” people whose\\nextra pounds settle primarily in their hips and thighs.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of obesity depends primarily on how\\noverweight a person is and his or her overall health.However, to be successful, any treatment must affect life-long behavioral changes rather than short-term weightloss. “Yo-yo” dieting, in which weight is repeatedly lostand regained, has been shown to increase a person’s like-lihood of developing fatal health problems than if theweight had been lost gradually or not lost at all. Behav-ior-focused treatment should concentrate on:\\n• What and how much a person eats. This aspect may\\ninvolve keeping a food diary and developing a betterunderstanding of the nutritional value and fat content offoods. It may also involve changing grocery-shoppinghabits (e.g. buying only what is on a prepared list andonly going on a certain day), timing of meals (to pre-vent feelings of hunger, a person may plan frequent,small meals), and actually slowing down the rate atwhich a person eats.\\n• How a person responds to food. This may involve\\nunderstanding what psychological issues underlie aperson’s eating habits. For example, one person maybinge eat when under stress , while another may always\\nuse food as a reward. In recognizing these psychologi-cal triggers, an individual can develop alternate copingmechanisms that do not focus on food.\\n• How they spend their time.

Varying routines and trying new activ-ities also keeps interest high.\\nFor most individuals who are mildly obese, these\\nbehavior modifications entail life-style changes they canmake independently while being supervised by a familyphysician. Other mildly obese persons may seek the helpof a commercial weight-loss program (e.g. WeightWatchers). The effectiveness of these programs is diffi-cult to assess, since programs vary widely, drop-out ratesare high, and few employ members of the medical com-munity. However, programs that emphasize realisticgoals, gradual progress, sensible eating, and exercise canbe very helpful and are recommended by many doctors.Programs that promise instant weight loss or featureseverely restricted diets are not effective and, in some\\ncases, can be dangerous.\\nFor individuals who are moderately obese, medical-\\nly supervised behavior modification and weight loss arerequired. While doctors will put most moderately obesepatients on a balanced, low-calorie diet (1200–1500 calo-ries a day), they may recommend that certain individualsfollow a very-low-calorie liquid protein diet (400–700calories) for as long as three months. This therapy, how-ever, should not be confused with commercial liquid pro-tein diets or commercial weight-loss shakes and drinks.Doctors tailor these diets to specific patients, monitorpatients carefully, and use them for only a short period oftime. In addition to reducing the amount and type ofcalories consumed by the patient, doctors will recom-mend professional therapists or psychiatrists who canhelp the individual effectively change his or her behaviorin regard to eating.\\nFor individuals who are severely obese, dietary\\nchanges and behavior modification may be accompaniedby surgery to reduce or bypass portions of the stomach orsmall intestine. Such obesity surgery , however, can be\\nrisky, and it is only performed on patients for whomother strategies have failed and whose obesity seriouslythreatens their health. Other surgical procedures are notrecommended, including liposuction , a purely cosmetic\\nprocedure in which a suction device is used to remove fatfrom beneath the skin, and jaw wiring , which can dam-\\nage gums and teeth and cause painful muscle spasms.\\nAppetite-suppressant drugs are sometimes pre-\\nscribed to aid in weight loss. These drugs work byincreasing levels of serotonin or catecholamine, whichare brain chemicals that control feelings of fullness.Appetite suppressants, though, are not considered trulyeffective, since most of the weight lost while taking themis usually regained after stopping them. Also, suppres-sants containing amphetamines can be potentially abusedby patients. While most of the immediate side-effects of\\nthese drugs are harmless, the long-term effects of thesedrugs, in many cases, is unknown. Two drugs, dexfenflu-ramine hydrochloride (Redux) and fenfluramine(Pondimin) as well as a combination fenfluramine-phen-termine (Fen/Phen) drug, were taken off the market whenthey were shown to cause potentially fatal heart defects.In November 1997, the United States Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) approved a new weight-loss drug,sibutramine, (Meridia). Available only with a doctor’sprescription, Meridia can significantly elevate bloodpressure and cause dry mouth ,headache ,constipation ,\\nand insomnia . This medication should not be used by\\npatients with a history of congestive heart failure , heart\\ndisease, stroke, or uncontrolled high blood pressure.\\nOther weight-loss medications available with a doc-\\ntor’s prescription include:\\n• diethylpropion (Tenuate, Tenuate dospan)\\n• mazindol (Mazanor, Sanorex)• phendimetrazine (Bontril, Plegine, Prelu-2, X-Trozine)• phentermine (Adipex-P, Fastin, Ionamin, Oby-trim)\\nPhenylpropanolamine (Acutrim, Dextarim) is the\\nonly nonprescription weight-loss drug approved by theFDA These over-the-counter diet aids can boost weightloss by 5%. Combined with diet and exercise and usedonly with a doctor’s approval, prescription anti-obesitymedications enable some patients to lose 10% moreweight than they otherwise would.

Red peppers and mustard help patients loseweight more quickly by accelerating the metabolic rate.\\nThey also make people more thirsty, so they crave waterinstead of food. Walnuts contain serotonin, the brainchemical that tells the body it has eaten enough. Dande-lion ( Taraxacum officinale ) can raise metabolism and\\ncounter a desire for sugary foods.\\nAcupressure and acupuncture can also suppress\\nfood cravings. Visualization and meditation can create\\nand reinforce a positive self-image that enhances thepatient’s determination to lose weight. By improvingphysical strength, mental concentration, and emotionalserenity, yoga can provide the same benefits. Also,\\npatients who play soft, slow music during meals oftenfind that they’re eating less food but enjoying it more.\\nGetting the correct ratios of protein, carbohydrates,\\nand good-quality fats can help in weight loss viaenhancement of the metabolism. Support groups that areinformed about healthy, nutritious, and balanced dietscan offer an individual the support he or she needs tomaintain this type of eating regimen.\\nPrognosis\\nAs many as 85% of dieters who do not exercise on a\\nregular basis regain their lost weight within two years. Infive years, the figure rises to 90%. Repeatedly losing andregaining weight (yo yo dieting) encourages the body tostore fat and may increase a patient’s risk of developingheart disease. The primary factor in achieving and main-taining weight loss is a life-long commitment to regularexercise and sensible eating habits.\\nPrevention\\nObesity experts suggest that a key to preventing\\nexcess weight gain is monitoring fat consumption\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2377Obesity\\nHeight And Weight Goals\\nMen\\nHeight Small Frame Medium Frame Large Frame\\n5’2” 5’3” 5’4” 128–134 lbs. 130–136 132–138 131–141 lbs. 133–143 135–145 138–150 lbs. 140–153 142–153\\n5’5” 5’6” 5’7” 134–140 136–142 138–145 137–148 139–151 142–154 144–160 146–164 149–1685’8” 5’9” 5’10” 140–148 142–151 144–154 145–157 148–160 151–163 152–172 155–176 158–1805’11” 6’0” 6’1” 146–157 159–160 152–164 154–166 157–170 160–174 161–184 164–188 168–1926’2” 6’3” 6’4” 155–168 158–172 162–176 164–178 167–182 171–187 172–197 176–202 181–207\\nWomen\\nHeight Small Frame Medium Frame Large Frame\\n4’10” 4’11” 5’0” 102–111 lbs. 103–113 104–115 109–121 lbs. 111–123 113–126 118–131 lbs. 120–134 112–137\\n5’1” 5’2” 5’3” 106–118 108–121 111–124 115–129 118–132 121–135 125–140 128–143 131–1475’4” 5’5” 5’6” 114–127 117–130 120–133 124–141 127–141 130–144 137–151 137–155 140–1595’7” 5’8” 5’9” 123–136 126–139 129–142 133–147 136–150 139–153 143–163 146–167 149–1705’10” 5’11” 6’0” 132–145 135–148 138–151 142–156 145–159 148–162 152–176 155–176 158–179'),\n",

This level of obesity often isrefered to as morbid obesity since it can result in manyserious, and potentially deadly, health problems, includ-ing hypertenison, Type II diabetes mellitus (non-insulin\\ndependent diabetes), increased risk for coronary disease,increased unexplained heart attack , hyperlipidemia, and\\na higher prevalence of colon, prostate, endometrial, and,possibly, breast cancer . Therefore, this surgery is per-\\nformed on people whose risk of complications of surgeryis outweighed by the need to lose weight to prevent healthcomplications, and for whom supervised weight loss andexercise programs have repeatedly failed. Obesity\\nsurgery, however, does not make people thin. Most peoplelose about 60% of their excess weight through this treat-ment. Changes in diet and exercise are still required tomaintain a normal weight.\\nThe theory behind obesity surgery is that if the vol-\\nume the stomach holds is reduced and the entrance intothe intestine is made smaller to slow stomach emptying,or part of the small intestine is bypassed or shortened,people will not be able to consume and/or absorb as\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2378Obesity surgery'),\n",

With obesity surgery the volume of food\\nthe stomach can hold is reduced from about four cups toabout 1/2 a cup.\\nInsurers may consider obesity surgery elective\\nsurgery and not cover it under their policy. Documentationof the necessity for surgery and approval from the insurershould be sought before this operation is performed.\\nPrecautions\\nObesity surgery should not be performed on people\\nwho are less than twice their ideal weight. It is also notappropriate for people who have substance addictions orwho have psychological disorders. Other considerationsin choosing candidates for obesity surgery include thegeneral health of the person and his or her willingness tocomply with follow-up treatment.\\nDescription\\nObesity surgery is usually performed in a hospital by\\na surgeon who has experience with obesity surgery or ata center that specializes in the procedure. General anes-\\nthesia is used, and the operation takes 2–3 hours. Thehospital stay lasts about a week.\\nThree procedures are currently used for obesity\\nsurgery:\\n• Gastric bypass surgery. Probably the most common\\ntype of obesity surgery, gastric bypass surgery has beenperformed in the United States for about 25 years. Inthis procedure, the volume of the stomach is reduced byfour rows of stainless steel staples that separate themain body of the stomach from a small, newly createdpouch. The pouch is attached at one end to the esopha-gus. At the other end is a very small opening into thesmall intestine. Food flows though this pouch, bypass-ing the main portion of the stomach and emptyingslowly into the small intestine where it is absorbed.\\n• Vertical banded gastroplasty. In this procedure an artifi-\\ncial pouch is created using staples in a different sectionof the stomach. Plastic mesh is sutured into part of thepouch to prevent it from dilating. In both surgeries thefood enters the small intestine farther along that it\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2379Obesity surgery\\nGastric bypass Vertical banded gastroplasty\\nThe purpose of obesity surgery is to reduce the size of the stomach and slow the stomach emptying process by narrowing\\nthe entrance into the intestine. With this surgery, the volume of food the stomach can hold is reduced from approximately 4cups to approximately one-half a cup.There are two types of procedures used for obesity surgery: gastric bypass surgery,and vertical banded gastroplasty, as shown in the illustration above.

Pre-surgery counseling is done to helppatients anticipate what to expect after the operation.\\nAftercare\\nImmediately after the operation, most patients are\\nrestricted to a liquid diet for two to three weeks; however,some may remain on it for up to 12 weeks. Patients thenmove on to a diet of pureed food for about a month, and,after about two months, most can tolerate solid food.High fat food is restricted because it is hard to digest andcauses diarrhea. Patients are expected to work on chang-ing their eating and exercise habits to assist in weightloss. Most people eat three to four small meals a day oncethey return to solid food. Eating too quickly or too muchafter obestity surgery can cause nausea and vomiting as\\nwell as intestinal “dumping,” a condition in which undi-gested food is shunted too quickly into the small intestine,causing pain, diarrhea, weakness, and dizziness .\\nRisks\\nAs in any abdominal surgery, there is always a risk\\nof excessive bleeding, infection, and allergic reaction toanesthesia. Specific risks associated with obesity surgeryinclude leaking or stretching of the pouch and looseningof the gastric staples. Although the average death rate\\nassociated with this procedure is less than one percent,the rate varies from center to center, ranging from 0–4%.Long term failure rates can reach 50%, sometimes mak-ing additional surgery necessary. Other complications ofobesity surgery include an intolerance to foods high infats, lactose intolerance , bouts of vomiting, diarrhea,\\nand intestinal discomfort\\nNormal results\\nMany people lose about 60% of the weight they\\nneed to reach their ideal weight through obesity surgery.However, surgery is not a magic weight-loss operation,and success also depends on the patient’s willingness to\\nexercise and eat low-calorie foods.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nGallager, Sharon, and R.

Anxiety disorder is the experience of\\nprolonged, excessive worry about circumstances in one’slife. OCD is characterized by distressing repetitivethoughts, impulses or images that are intense, frightening,absurd, or unusual. These thoughts are followed by ritual-ized actions that are usually bizarre and irrational. Theseritual actions, known as compulsions, help reduce anxietycaused by the individual’s obsessive thoughts. Oftendescribed as the “disease of doubt,” the sufferer usuallyknows the obsessive thoughts and compulsions are irra-tional but, on another level, fears they may be true.\\nDescription\\nAlmost one out of every 40 people will suffer from\\nobsessive-compulsive disorder at some time in their lives.The condition is two to three times more common thaneither schizophrenia or manic depression, and strikes\\nmen and women of every ethnic group, age and sociallevel. Because the symptoms are so distressing, sufferersoften hide their fears and rituals but cannot avoid actingon them. OCD sufferers are often unable to decide if theirfears are realistic and need to be acted upon.\\nMost people with obsessive-compulsive disorder have\\nboth obsessions and compulsions, but occasionally a per-son will have just one or the other. The degree to whichthis condition can interfere with daily living also varies.Some people are barely bothered, while others find theobsessions and compulsions to be profoundly traumaticand spend much time each day in compulsive actions.\\nObsessions are intrusive, irrational thoughts that keep\\npopping up in a person’s mind, such as “my hands are\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2380Obsessive-compulsive disorder'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 87}, page_content='dirty, I must wash them again.” Typical obsessions\\ninclude fears of dirt, germs, contamination, and violent oraggressive impulses. Other obsessions include feelingresponsible for others’ safety, or an irrational fear of hit-ting a pedestrian with a car. Additional obsessions caninvolve excessive religious feelings or intrusive sexualthoughts. The patient may need to confess frequently to areligious counselor or may fear acting out the strong sex-ual thoughts in a hostile way. People with obsessive-com-pulsive disorder may have an intense preoccupation withorder and symmetry, or be unable to throw anything out.\\nCompulsions usually involve repetitive rituals such\\nas excessive washing (especially handwashing orbathing), cleaning, checking and touching, counting,arranging or hoarding. As the person performs these acts,he may feel temporarily better, but there is no long-last-ing sense of satisfaction or completion after the act isperformed. Often, a person with obsessive-compulsivedisorder believes that if the ritual isn’t performed, some-thing dreadful will happen. While these compulsionsmay temporarily ease stress , short-term comfort is pur-\\nchased at a heavy price—time spent repeating compul-sive actions and a long-term interference with life.\\nThe difference between OCD and other compulsive\\nbehavior is that while people who have problems withgambling, overeating or with substance abuse mayappear to be compulsive, these activities also providepleasure to some degree. The compulsions of OCD, onthe other hand, are never pleasurable.\\nOCD may be related to some other conditions, such\\nas the continual urge to pull out body hair (trichotilloma-nia); fear of having a serious disease ( hypochondriasis )\\nor preoccupation with imagined defects in personalappearance disorder (body dysmorphia). Some peoplewith OCD also have Tourette syndrome , a condition\\nfeaturing tics and unwanted vocalizations (such asswearing). OCD is often linked with depression andother anxiety disorders .\\nCauses and symptoms\\nWhile no one knows for sure, research suggests that\\nthe tendency to develop obsessive-compulsive disorder isinherited. There are several theories behind the cause ofOCD. Some experts believe that OCD is related to achemical imbalance within the brain that causes a com-munication problem between the front part of the brain(frontal lobe) and deeper parts of the brain responsiblefor the repetitive behavior. Research has shown that theorbital cortex located on the underside of the brain’sfrontal lobe is overactive in OCD patients. This may beone reason for the feeling of alarm that pushes the patientinto compulsive, repetitive actions. It is possible thatpeople with OCD experience overactivity deep within\\nthe brain that causes the cells to get “stuck,” much like ajammed transmission in a car damages the gears. Thiscould lead to the development of rigid thinking andrepetitive movements common to the disorder. The factthat drugs which boost the levels of serotonin, a brainmessenger substance linked to emotion and many differ-ent anxiety disorders, in the brain can reduce OCDsymptoms may indicate that to some degree OCD isrelated to levels of serotonin in the brain.\\nRecently, scientists have identified an intriguing link\\nbetween childhood episodes of strep throat and the\\ndevelopment of OCD. It appears that in some vulnerablechildren, strep antibodies attack a certain part of thebrain. Antibodies are cells that the body produces to fightspecific diseases. That attack results in the developmentof excessive washing or germ phobias . A phobia is a\\nstrong but irrational fear. In this instance the phobia isfear of disease germs present on commonly handledobjects. These symptoms would normally disappear overtime, but some children who have repeated infectionsmay develop full-blown OCD. Treatment with antibi-\\notics has resulted in lessening of the OCD symptoms in\\nsome of these children.\\nIf one person in a family has obsessive-compulsive\\ndisorder, there is a 25% chance that another immediatefamily member has the condition. It also appears that stressand psychological factors may worsen symptoms, whichusually begin during adolescence or early adulthood.\\nDiagnosis\\nPeople with obsessive-compulsive disorder feel\\nashamed of their problem and often try to hide theirsymptoms. They avoid seeking treatment. Because theycan be very good at keeping their problem from friendsand family, many sufferers don’t get the help they needuntil the behaviors are deeply ingrained habits and hardto change. As a result, the condition is often misdiag-nosed or underdiagnosed. All too often, it can take morethan a decade between the onset of symptoms and properdiagnosis and treatment.\\nWhile scientists seem to agree that OCD is related to\\na disruption in serotonin levels, there is no blood test forthe condition. Instead, doctors diagnose OCD after eval-uating a person’s symptoms and history.\\nTreatment\\nObsessive-compulsive disorder can be effectively\\ntreated by a combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy\\nand medication that regulates the brain’s serotonin levels.Drugs that are approved to treat obsessive-compulsive dis-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2381Obsessive-compulsive disorder'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 88}, page_content='order include fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine (Luvox),\\nparoxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft), all selective\\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI’s) that affect the\\nlevel of serotonin in the brain. Older drugs include the anti-depressant clomipramine (Anafranil), a widely-studieddrug in the treatment of OCD, but one that carries a greaterrisk of side effects. Drugs should be taken for at least 12weeks before deciding whether or not they are effective.\\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) teaches patients\\nhow to confront their fears and obsessive thoughts bymaking the effort to endure or wait out the activities thatusually cause anxiety without compulsively performingthe calming rituals. Eventually their anxiety decreases.People who are able to alter their thought patterns in thisway can lessen their preoccupation with the compulsiverituals. At the same time, the patient is encouraged torefocus attention elsewhere, such as on a hobby.\\nIn a few severe cases where patients have not\\nresponded to medication or behavioral therapy, brainsurgery may be tried as a way of relieving the unwantedsymptoms. Surgery can help up to a third of patients withthe most severe form of OCD. The most common opera-tion involves removing a section of the brain called thecingulate cortex. The serious side effects of this surgeryfor some patients include seizures, personality changesand less ability to plan.\\nAlternative treatment\\nBecause OCD sometimes responds to SSRI antide-\\npressants, a botanical medicine called St. John’s wort\\n(Hypericum perforatum ) might have some beneficial\\neffect as well, according to herbalists. Known popularlyas “Nature’s Prozac,” St. John’s wort is prescribed byherbalists for the treatment of anxiety and depression.They believe that this herb affects brain levels of sero-tonin in the same way that SSRI antidepressants do.Herbalists recommend a dose of 300 mg., three times perday. In about one out of 400 people, St. John’s wort (likeProzac) may initially increase the level of anxiety.Homeopathic constitutional therapy can help rebalancethe patient’s mental, emotional, and physical well-being,allowing the behaviors of OCD to abate over time.\\nPrognosis\\nObsessive-compulsive disorder is a chronic disease\\nthat, if untreated, can last for decades, fluctuating frommild to severe and worsening with age. When treated bya combination of drugs and behavioral therapy, somepatients go into complete remission. Unfortunately, notall patients have such a good response. About 20% ofpeople cannot find relief with either drugs or behavioraltherapy. Hospitalization may be required in some cases.KEY TERMS\\nAnxiety disorder —This is the experience of pro-\\nlonged, excessive worry about circumstances inone’s life.

Obstetrical emergencies may also occurduring active labor, and after delivery (postpartum).Obstetrical emergencies of pregnancy\\nECTOPIC PREGNANCY. An ectopic, or tubal, preg-\\nnancy occurs when the fertilized egg implants itself inthe fallopian tube rather than the uterine wall. If the preg-nancy is not terminated at an early stage, the fallopiantube will rupture, causing internal hemorrhaging andpotentially resulting in permanent infertility .\\nPLACENTAL ABRUPTION. Also called abruptio pla-\\ncenta ,placental abruption occurs when the placenta\\nseparates from the uterus prematurely, causing bleedingand contractions. If over 50% of the placenta separates,both the fetus and mother are at risk.\\nPLACENTA PREVIA. When the placenta attaches to\\nthe mouth of the uterus and partially or completelyblocks the cervix, the position is termed placenta previa\\n(or low-lying placenta). Placenta previa can result in\\npremature bleeding and possible postpartum hemor-rhage.\\nPREECLAMPSIA/ECLAMPSIA. Preeclampsia (tox-\\nemia), or pregnancy-induced high blood pressure, causessevere edema (swelling due to water retention) and can\\nimpair kidney and liver function. The condition occurs inapproximately 5% of all United States pregnancies. If itprogresses to eclampsia, toxemia is potentially fatal formother and child.\\nPREMATURE RUPTURE OF MEMBRANES (PROM).\\nPremature rupture of membranes is the breaking of\\nthe bag of waters (amniotic fluid) before contractions orlabor begins. The situation is only considered an emer-gency if the break occurs before thirty-seven weeks andresults in significant leakage of amniotic fluid and/orinfection of the amniotic sac.\\nObstetrical emergencies during labor and delivery\\nAMNIOTIC FLUID EMBOLISM. A rare but frequently\\nfatal complication of labor, this condition occurs whenamniotic fluid embolizes from the amniotic sac andthrough the veins of the uterus and into the circulatorysystem of the mother. The fetal cells present in the fluidthen block or clog the pulmonary artery, resulting inheart attack . This complication can also happen during\\npregnancy, but usually occurs in the presence of strongcontractions.\\nINVERSION OR RUPTURE OF UTERUS. During labor,\\na weak spot in the uterus (such as a scar or a uterine wallthat is thinned by a multiple pregnancy ) may tear,\\nresulting in a uterine rupture. In certain circumstances, aportion of the placenta may stay attached to the wall andwill pull the uterus out with it during delivery. This iscalled uterine inversion.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2383Obstetrical emergencies'),\n",

Placenta accreta occurs when\\nthe placenta is implanted too deeply into the uterine wall,and will not detach during the late stages of childbirth ,\\nresulting in uncontrolled bleeding.\\nPROLAPSED UMBILICAL CORD. A prolapse of the\\numbilical cord occurs when the cord is pushed down intothe cervix or vagina. If the cord becomes compressed,the oxygen supply to the fetus could be diminished,resulting in brain damage or possible death .\\nSHOULDER DYSTOCIA. Shoulder dystocia occurs\\nwhen the baby’s shoulder(s) becomes wedged in the birthcanal after the head has been delivered.\\nObstetrical emergencies postpartum\\nPOSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE OR INFECTION.

In some cases, past medical history, includingprevious pregnancies and deliveries, may help an obste-trician anticipate the possibility of complications.\\nSigns and symptoms of an obstetrical emergency\\ninclude, but are not limited to:\\n• Diminished fetal activity. In the late third trimester,\\nfewer than ten movements in a two hour period mayindicate that the fetus is in distress.\\n• Abnormal bleeding. During pregnancy, brown or white\\nto pink vaginal discharge is normal, bright red blood orblood containing large clots is not. After delivery, con-tinual blood loss of over 500 ml indicates hemorrhage.\\n• Leaking amniotic fluid. Amniotic fluid is straw-colored\\nand may easily be confused with urine leakage, but canbe differentiated by its slightly sweet odor.\\n• Severe abdominal pain . Stomach or lower back pain\\ncan indicate preeclampsia or an undiagnosed ectopic\\npregnancy . Postpartum stomach pain can be a sign of\\ninfection or hemorrhage.\\n• Contractions. Regular contractions before 37 weeks of\\ngestation can signal the onset of preterm labor due toobstetrical complications.\\n• Abrupt and rapid increase in blood pressure. Hyper-\\ntension is one of the first signs of toxemia.\\n• Edema. Sudden and significant swelling of hands and\\nfeet caused by fluid retention from toxemia.\\n• Unpleasant smelling vaginal discharge. A thick, mal-\\nodorous discharge from the vagina can indicate a post-partum infection.•Fever . Fever may indicate an active infection.\\n• Loss of consciousness. Shock due to blood loss (hem-\\norrhage) or amniotic embolism can precipitate a loss of\\nconsciousness in the mother.\\n• Blurred vision and headaches. Vision problems and\\nheadache are a possible symptom of preeclampsia.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of an obstetrical emergency typically\\ntakes place in a hospital or other urgent care facility. Aspecialist will take the patient’s medical history and per-form a pelvic and general physical examination . The\\nmother’s vital signs are taken, and if preeclampsia is sus-pected, blood pressure may be monitored over a periodof time. The fetal heartbeat is assessed with a dopplerstethoscope, and diagnostic blood and urine tests of themother may also be performed, including laboratoryanalysis for protein and/or bacterial infection. Anabdominal ultrasound may aid in the diagnosis of any\\ncondition that involves a malpositioned placenta, such asplacenta previa or placenta abruption.\\nIn cases where an obstetrical complication is suspect-\\ned, a fetal heart monitor is positioned externally on themother’s abdomen. If the fetal heart rate is erratic or weak,or if it does not respond to movement, the fetus may be indistress. A biophysical profile (BPP) may also be per-formed to evaluate the health of the fetus. The BPP usesdata from an ultrasound examination to analyze the fetussize, movement, heart rate, and surrounding amniotic fluid.\\nIf the mother’s membranes have ruptured and her\\ncervix is partially dilated, an internal fetal scalp electrodecan be inserted through the vagina to assess heart rate. Afetal oximetry monitor that measures the oxygen satura-tion levels of the fetus may also be attached to the scalp.\\nTreatment\\nObstetrical emergencies of pregnancy\\nECTOPIC PREGNANCY. Treatment of an ectopic\\npregnancy is laparoscopic surgical removal of the fertil-ized ovum. If the fallopian tube has burst or been dam-aged, further surgery will be necessary.\\nPLACENTAL ABRUPTION. In mild cases of placental\\nabruption, bed rest may prevent further separation of theplacenta and stem bleeding. If a significant abruption(over 50%) occurs, the fetus may have to be deliveredimmediately and a blood transfusion may be required.\\nPLACENTA PREVIA. Hospitalization or highly restricted\\nat-home bed rest is usually recommended if placenta previais diagnosed after the twentieth week of pregnancy.

Treatment of preeclamp-\\nsia depends upon the age of the fetus and the acuteness ofthe condition. A woman near full term who has only mildtoxemia may have labor induced to deliver the child assoon as possible. Severe preeclampsia in a woman nearterm also calls for immediate delivery of the child, as thisis the only known cure for the condition.

Occupational asthma is most apt to affectworkers who have personal or family histories of allergies\\nor asthma, or who are often required to handle or breathedust or fumes created by especially irritating material.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMore than 240 causes of occupational asthma have\\nbeen identified. Even short-term exposure to low levelsof one or more irritating substances can cause a very sen-sitive person to develop symptoms of occupational asth-ma. A person who has occupational asthma has one ormore symptoms, including coughing, shortness of\\nbreath , tightness in the chest, and wheezing . Symptoms\\nmay appear less than 24 hours after the person is firstexposed to the irritant or develop two or three years later.\\nAt first, symptoms appear while the person is at\\nwork or several hours after the end of the workday.Symptoms disappear or diminish when the person spendstime away from the workplace and return or intensifywhen exposure is renewed.\\nAs the condition becomes more advanced, symp-\\ntoms sometimes occur even when the person is not in theworkplace. Symptoms may also develop in response tominor sources of lung irritation.\\nDiagnosis\\nAn allergist, occupational medicine specialist, or a\\ndoctor who treats lung disease performs a thorough physi-\\ncal examination and takes a medical history that explores:\\n• the kind of work the patient has done\\n• the types of exposures the patient may have experi-\\nenced\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2386Occupational asthmaOccupations Associated With Asthma\\nAnimal Handling\\nBakeriesHealth CareJewelry MakingLaboratory WorkManufacturing DetergentsNickel PlatingSolderingSnow Crab and Egg ProcessingTanneries'),\n",

Laboratory analysis of blood and sputum mayconfirm a diagnosis of workplace asthma. To pinpointthe cause more precisely, the doctor may ask the patientto inhale specific substances and monitor the body’sresponse to them. This is called a challenge test.\\nTreatment\\nThe most effective treatment for occupational asth-\\nma is to reduce or eliminate exposure to symptom-pro-ducing substances.\\nMedication may be prescribed for workers who\\ncan’t prevent occasional exposure. Medication, physicaltherapy, and breathing aids may all be needed to relievesymptoms of advanced occupational asthma involvingairway damage.A patient who has occupational asthma should learn\\nwhat causes symptoms and how to control them, andwhat to do when an asthma attack occurs.\\nBecause asthma symptoms and the substances that\\nprovoke them can change, a patient who has occupation-al asthma should be closely monitored by a family physi-cian, allergist, or doctor who specializes in occupationalmedicine or lung disease.\\nPrognosis\\nOccupational asthma is usually reversible. However,\\ncontinued exposure to the symptom-producing substancecan cause permanent lung damage.\\nIn time, occupational asthma can cause asthma-like\\nsymptoms to occur when the patient is exposed to tobac-co smoke, household dust, and other ordinary irritants.\\nSmoking aggravates symptoms of occupational\\nasthma. Patients who eliminate workplace exposure andstop smoking are more apt to recover fully than thosewho change jobs but continue to smoke.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2387Occupational asthma\\nALICE HAMILTON (1869–1970)\\nAlice Hamilton was born on February 27, 1869, in\\nNew York City, the second of five children born to Mont-gomery Hamilton, a wholesale grocer,and Gertrude (Pond)Hamilton. She earned a medical degree from the Universityof Michigan in 1893, without having completed an under-\\ngraduate degree and taking surprisingly few science cours-es. Realizing that she wanted to pursue research rather thanmedical practice, Hamilton went on to do further studiesboth in the United States and abroad: from 1895–1896 atLeipzig and Munich; 1896–1897 at Johns Hopkins; and1902 in Paris at the Pasteur Institute. In 1897 she accepted apost as professor of pathology at the Women’s Medical Col-lege at Northwestern University in Chicago.\\nIn Chicago Hamilton became a resident of Hull\\nHouse, the pioneering settlement designed to give careand advice to the poor of Chicago. Here, under the influ-ence of Jane Addams, the founder of Hull House, Hamil-ton saw the effects of poverty up close, leading her to alifelong career focused on industrial medicine.\\nAlice Hamilton was a pioneer in correcting the med-\\nical problems caused by industrialization, awakening thecountry in the early twentieth century to the dangers ofindustrial poisons and hazardous working conditions.Through her untiring efforts, toxic substances in the lead,mining, painting,pottery, and rayon industries wereexposed and legislation passed to protect workers. Shewas also a champion of worker’s compensation laws, andwas instrumental in bringing about this type of legislationin the state of Illinois. A medical doctor and researcher,she was the first woman of faculty status at Harvard Uni-versity, and was a consultant on governmental commis-sions, both domestic and foreign.\\n(AP/Wide World Photos.

But physicians typical-ly apply a narrower definition, restricting the diagnosisof oligomenorrhea to women whose periods were regu-larly established before they developed problems withinfrequent flow. With oligomenorrhea, menstrual periodsoccur at intervals of greater than 35 days, with only fourto nine periods in a year.\\nDescription\\nTrue oligomenorrhea can not occur until menstrual peri-\\nods have been established. In the United States, 97.5% ofwomen have begun normal menstrual cycles by age 16. Thecomplete absence of menstruation, whether menstrual peri-ods never start or whether they stop after having been estab-lished, is called amenorrhea . Oligomenorrhea can become\\namenorrhea if menstruation stops for six months or more.\\nIt is quite common for women at the beginning and\\nend of their reproductive lives to miss or have irregularperiods. This is normal and is usually the result of imper-fect coordination between the hypothalamus, the pituitarygland, and the ovaries. For no apparent reason, a fewwomen menstruate (with ovulation occurring) on a regularschedule as infrequently as once every two months. Forthem that schedule is normal and not a cause for concern.\\nWomen with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\\nare also likely to suffer from oligomenorrhea. PCOS is acondition in which the ovaries become filled with smallcysts. Women with PCOS show menstrual irregularitiesthat range from oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea on theone hand to very heavy, irregular periods on the other.The condition affects about 6% of premenopausalwomen and is related to excess androgen production.\\nOther physical and emotional factors also cause a\\nwoman to miss periods. These include:\\n• emotional stress\\n• chronic illness• poor nutrition\\n• eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa\\n• excessive exercise\\n• estrogen-secreting tumors• illicit use of anabolic steriod drugs to enhance athletic\\nperformance\\nSerious ballet dancers, gymnasts, and ice skaters are\\nespecially at risk because they combine heavy activitywith a diet intended to keep their weight down. One studyat the University of California San Francisco found that11% of female ultramarathon runners had amenorrhea oroligomenorrhea. This is a much higher rate than in thegeneral population. Women’s coaches are becoming moreaware of the problem and are encouraging female athletesto seek medical advice. A gynecologist is the doctor mostexperienced in diagnosing and treating oligomenorrhea.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSymptoms of oligomenorrhea include:\\n• menstrual periods at intervals of more than 35 days\\n• irregular menstrual periods with unpredictable flow• some women with oligomenorrhea may have difficulty\\nconceiving\\nOligomenorrhea that occurs in adolescents is often\\ncaused by immaturity or lack of synchronization between\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2388Oligomenorrhea'),\n",

The\\nhypothalamus is part of the brain that controls body tem-perature, cellular metabolism, and basic functions suchas eating, sleeping, and reproduction. It secretes hor-mones that regulate the pituitary gland.\\nThe pituitary gland is then stimulated to produce\\nhormones that affect growth and reproduction. At thebeginning and end of a woman’s reproductive life, someof these hormone messages may not be synchronized,causing menstrual irregularities.\\nIn PCOS, oligomenorrhea is probably caused by inap-\\npropriate levels of both female and male hormones. Malehormones are produced in small quantities by all women,but in women with PCOS, levels of male hormone (andro-gens) are slightly higher than in other women.\\nIn athletes, models, actresses, dancers, and women\\nwith anorexia nervosa, oligomenorrhea occurs becausethe ratio of body fat to weight drops too low.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of oligomenorrhea begins with the patient\\ninforming the doctor about infrequent periods. Womenshould seek medical treatment after three missed periods.The doctor will ask for a detailed description of the prob-lem and take a history of how long it has existed and anypatterns the patient has observed. A woman can assist thedoctor in diagnosing the cause of oligomenorrhea bykeeping a record of the time, frequency, length, and quan-tity of bleeding. She should also tell the doctor about anyillnesses including longstanding conditions like diabetes\\nmellitus . The doctor may also inquire about her diet,\\nexercise patterns, sexual activity, contraceptive use, cur-rent medications, or past surgical procedures.\\nLaboratory tests\\nAfter taking the woman’s history, the gynecologist or\\nfamily practitioner does a pelvic examination and Pap test .\\nTo rule out specific causes of oligomenorrhea, the doctormay also do a pregnancy test and blood tests to check the\\nlevel of thyroid hormone. Based on the initial test results,the doctor may want to do tests to determine the level ofother hormones that play a role in reproduction.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of oligomenorrhea depends on the cause.\\nIn adolescents and women near menopause , oligomen-\\norrhea usually needs no treatment. For athletes, changesin training routines and eating habits may be enough toreturn the woman to a regular menstrual cycle.\\nMost patients suffering from oligomenorrhea are\\ntreated with birth control pills. Other women, includingthose with PCOS, are treated with hormones. Prescribed\\nhormones depend on which particular hormones are defi-cient or out of balance. When oligomenorrhea is causedby a chronic underlying disorder or disease, such asanorexia nervosa, the underlying condition must be treat-ed for oligomenorrhea to improve.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAs with conventional medicial treatments, alterna-\\ntive treatments are based on the cause of the condition. Ifa hormonal imbalance is revealed by laboratory testing,hormone replacements that are more “natural” for thebody (including tri-estrogen and natural progesterone)are recommended. Glandular therapy can assist in bring-ing about a balance in the glands involved in the repro-ductive cycle, including the hypothalmus, pituitary, thy-roid, ovarian, and adrenal glands. Since homeopathy\\nand acupuncture work on deep, energetic levels to\\nrebalance the body, these two modalities may be helpfulin treating oligomenorrhea. Western and Chinese herbalmedicines also can be very effective. Herbs used to treatoligomenorrhea include dong quai ( Angelica sinensis ),\\nblack cohosh ( Cimicifuga racemosa ), and chaste tree\\n(Vitex agnus-castus ). Diet and adequate nutrition, includ-\\ning adequate protein, essential fatty acids, whole grains,and fresh fruits and vegetables, are important for everywoman, especially if deficiencies are present or if sheregularly exercises very strenuously. For some women,meditation ,guided imagery , and visualization can play\\na key role in the treatment of oligomenorrhea.\\nPrognosis\\nMany women, including those with PCOS, are suc-\\ncessfully treated with hormones for oligomenorrhea.They have more frequent periods and begin ovulatingduring their menstrual cycle, restoring their fertility.\\nFor women who do not respond to hormones or who\\ncontinue to have an underlying condition that causesoligomenorrhea, the outlook is less positive. Women whohave oligomenorrhea may have difficulty conceiving chil-dren and may receive fertility drugs. The absence of ade-quate estrogen increases risk for bone loss ( osteoporosis )\\nand cardiovascular disease. Women who do not have regu-lar periods also are more likely to develop uterine cancer .\\nOligomenorrhea can become amenorrhea at any time,increasing the chance of having these complications.\\nPrevention\\nOligomenorrhea is preventable only in women whose\\nlow body fat to weight ratio is keeping them from main-taining a regular menstrual cycle.

The actual infection is of the bed of thenail and of the plate under the surface of the nail.KEY TERMS\\nAnorexia nervosa —A disorder of the mind and\\nbody in which people starve themselves in adesire to be thin, despite being of normal or belownormal body weight for their size and age.\\nCyst—An abnormal sac containing fluid or semi-\\nsolid material.\\nOsteoporosis —The excessive loss of calcium from\\nthe bones, causing the bones to become fragile andbreak easily. Women who are not menstruating areespecially vulnerable to this condition becauseestrogen, a hormone that protects bones against cal-cium loss, decreases drastically after menopause.Description\\nOnychomycosis is the most common of all diseases\\nof the nails in adults. In North America, the incidencefalls roughly between 2–13%. The incidence of ony-chomycosis is also greater in older adults, and up to 90%of the elderly may be affected. Men are more commonlyinfected than women.\\nIndividuals who are especially susceptible include\\nthose with chronic diseases such as diabetes and circula-tory problems and those with diseases that suppress theimmune system. Other risk factors include a family his-tory, previous trauma to the nails, warm climate, occlu-sive or tight footwear.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nOnychomycosis is caused by three types of fungi,\\ncalled dermatophytes, yeasts, and nondermatophytemolds. Fungi are simple parasitic plant organisms thatdon’t need sunlight to grow. Toenails are especially sus-ceptible because fungi prefer dark damp places. Swim-ming pools, locker rooms, and showers typically harborfungi. Chronic diseases such as diabetes, problems withthe circulatory system, or immune deficiency disease arerisk factors. A history of athlete’s foot and excess perspi-\\nration are also risk factors.\\nOnychomycosis can be present for years without\\ncausing pain or disturbing symptoms. Typically, the nail\\nbecomes thicker and changes to a yellowish-brown. Foulsmelling debris may collect under the nail. The infectioncan spread to the surrounding nails and even the skin.\\nDiagnosis\\nTo make a diagnosis of onychomycosis, the clinician\\nmust collect a specimen of the nail in which infection issuspected. A clipping is taken from the nail plate, and asample of the debris from underneath the nail bed is alsotaken, usually with a sharp curette. Debris from the nailsurface may also be taken. These will be sent for micro-scopic analysis to a laboratory, as well as cultured todetermine what types of fungus are growing there.\\nTreatment\\nOnychomycosis is very difficult and sometimes\\nimpossible to treat, and therapy is often long-term. Thera-py consists of topical treatments that are applied directlyto the nails, as well as two systemic drugs, griseofulvinand ketoconazole. Topical therapy is reserved for only themildest cases. The use of griseofulvin and ketoconazole isproblematic, and there are typically high relapse rates of50–85%. In addition, treatment must be continued for a\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2390Onychomycosis'),\n",

Individuals taking these medications mustalso abstain from alcohol consumption.\\nIn the past few years, newer oral antifungal agents\\nhave been developed, and include itraconazole (Spora-nox), terbinafine (Lamisil), and fluconazole (Diflucan).These agents, when taken orally for as little as 12 weeks,bring about better cure rates and fewer side effects thaneither griseofulvin or ketoconazole. The most commonside effect is stomach upset. Patients taking oral antifun-gal therapy must have a complete blood count and liver\\nenzyme workup every four to six weeks. Terbinafine inparticular has markedly less toxicity to the liver, one ofthe more severe side effects of the older agents, griseo-fulvin and ketoconazole.\\nTreatment should be continued until microscopic\\nexam or culture shows no more fungal infection. Nailsmay, however, continue to look damaged even after aclinical cure is achieved. Nails may take up to a full yearto return to normal. If the nail growth slows or stops,additional doses of antifungal therapy should be taken.\\nNail debridement is another treatment option, but it\\nis considered by many to be primitive compared with topi-cal or systemic treatment. Clinicians perform nail debride-ment in their offices. The nail is cut and then thinned usingsurgical tools or chemicals, and then the loose debrisunder the nail is removed. The procedure is painless, andoften improves the appearance of the nails immediately. Inaddition, it helps whatever medication being used to pene-trate the newly thinned nail. Patients with very thickenednails will sometimes undergo chemical removal of a nail.A combination of oral, topical, and surgical removal canincrease the chances of curing the infection.\\nAlternative treatment\\nFor controlling onychomycosis, as opposed to curing\\nit, some experts advocate using Lotrimin cream, availableover the counter. The cream should be thoroughly rubbedinto the nail daily in order to control the infection.\\nIn general, nutrition may also play a role in promot-\\ning good nail health and thus preventing nail disease.Adequate protein and minerals , in the form of nuts,\\nseeds, whole grains, legumes, fresh vegetables, and fish,should be consumed. Sugars, alcohol, and caffeine\\nshould be avoided. Certain supplements may also be ben-eficial, including vitamin A (10,000 IU per day), zinc(15–30 mg per day), iron (ferrous glycinate 100 mg perday, vitamin B\\n12(1,000 mcg per day), and essential fatty\\nacids in the form of flax, borage, or evening primrose oil(1,000–1,5000 mg twice daily).KEY TERMS\\nCurette —Spoon-shaped instrument for removing\\ndebris, growths, or infected nail matter.\\nDermatophytes, yeasts, and nondermatophyte\\nmolds —Three types of fungi responsible for fungal\\ninfections of the nails.\\nHerbal remedies may also relieve some of the symp-\\ntoms of onychomycosis. A combination of coneflower,oregano, spilanthes, usnea, Oregon grape root, and myrrhcan be used as a tincture (20 drops four times daily).\\nUndiluted grapefruit seed extract and tea tree oil are\\nalso said to be beneficial when applied topically to theinfected nails.\\nPrognosis\\nOnychomycosis is typically quite difficult to cure\\ncompletely. Even if a clinical cure is achieved after longtherapy with either topical or oral drugs, normalregrowth takes four to six months in the fingernails, andeight to 12 months in the toenails, which grow moreslowly. Relapse is common, and often, the nail or nailbed is permanently damaged. For toenails infected withonychomycosis, terbinafine seems to offer the highestcure rate (35–50%). Itraconazole cure rates typicallyrange from 25–40%, and those with fluconazole, whichwas recently approved in the United States, have notbeen documented by long-term trials\\nPrevention\\nKeeping the feet clean and dry, and washing with\\nsoap and water and drying thoroughly are importantpreventive steps to take to prevent onychomycosis.Other preventive measures include keeping the nails cutshort and wearing shower shoes whenever walking orshowering in public places. Daily changes of shoes,socks, or hosiery are also helpful. Excessively tighthose or shoes promote moisture, which in turn, pro-vides a wonderful environment for onychomycoticinfections. To prevent this, individuals should wear onlysocks made of synthetic fibers, which can absorb mois-ture more quickly than those made of cotton or wools.Manicure and pedicure tools should be disinfected aftereach use. Finally, nail polish should not be applied tonails that are infected, as this causes the water or mois-ture that collects under the surface of the nail to notevaporate and be trapped.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2391Onychomycosis'),\n",

It is also called ovariectomy. If one ovary isremoved, a woman may continue to menstruate and havechildren. If both ovaries are removed, menstruation stopsand a woman loses the ability to have children.\\nPurpose\\nOophorectomy is performed to:\\n• remove cancerous ovaries\\n• remove the source of estrogen that stimulates some\\ncancers\\n• remove a large ovarian cyst\\n• excise an abscess\\n• treat endometriosis\\nIn an oophorectomy one or a portion of one ovary may\\nbe removed or both ovaries may be removed. Whenoophorectomy is done to treat ovarian cancer or other\\nspreading cancers, both ovaries are always removed. Thisis called a bilateral oophorectomy. Oophorectomies aresometimes performed on pre-menopausal women whohave estrogen-sensitive breast cancer in an effort to\\nremove the main source of estrogen from their bodies. Thisprocedure has become less common than it was in the1990s. Today, chemotherapy drugs are available that alter\\nthe production of estrogen and tamoxifen blocks any of theeffects any remaining estrogen may have on cancer cells.Until the 1980s, women over age 40 having hys-\\nterectomies (surgical removal of the uterus) routinely hadhealthy ovaries and fallopian tubes removed at the sametime. This operation is called a bilateral salpingo-\\noophorectomy . Many physicians reasoned that a woman\\nover 40 was approaching menopause and soon her\\novaries would stop secreting estrogen and releasing eggs.Removing the ovaries would eliminate the risk of ovariancancer and only accelerate menopause by a few years.\\nIn the 1990s, the thinking about routine oophorecto-\\nmy began to change. The risk of ovarian cancer in womenwho have no family history of the disease is less than 1%.Meanwhile, removing the ovaries increases the risk ofcardiovascular disease and accelerates osteoporosis\\nunless a woman takes prescribed hormone replacements.\\nUnder certain circumstances, oophorectomy may\\nstill be the treatment of choice to prevent breast and ovar-ian cancer in certain high-risk women. A study done atthe University of Pennsylvania and released in 2000showed that healthy women who carried the BRCA1 orBRCA2 genetic mutations that pre-disposed them tobreast cancer had their risk of breast cancer drop from80% to 19% when their ovaries were removed before age40. Women between the ages of 40 and 50 showed lessrisk reduction, and there was no significant reduction ofbreast cancer risk in women over age 50.\\nOverall, ovarian cancer still ranks low on a woman’s\\nlist of health concerns: It accounts for only 4% of all can-cers in women. But the lifetime risk for developing ovari-an cancer in women who have mutations in BRCA1 issignificantly increased over the general population andmay cause an ovarian cancer risk of 30% by age 60. Forwomen at increased risk, oophorectomy may be consid-ered after the age of 35 if childbearing is complete.\\nThe value of ovary removal in preventing both breast\\nand ovarian cancer has been documented. However, thereare disagreements within the medical community aboutwhen and at what age this treatment should be offered.Preventative oophorectomy, called preventative bilateraloophorectomy (PBO), is not always covered by insur-ance. One study conducted in 2000 at the University ofCalifornia at San Francisco found that only 20% of insur-ers paid for PBO. Another 25% had a policy against pay-ing for the operation, and the remaining 55% said thatthey would decide about payment on an individual basis.\\nPrecautions\\nThere are situations in which oophorectomy is a\\nmedically wise choice for women who have a family his-tory of breast or ovarian cancer. However, women withhealthy ovaries who are undergoing hysterectomy for\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2392Oophorectomy'),\n",

It is\\nperformed through the same type of incision, either verticalor horizontal, as an abdominal hysterectomy. Horizontalincisions leave a less noticeable scar, but vertical incisionsgive the surgeon a better view of the abdominal cavity.\\nAfter the incision is made, the abdominal muscles\\nare pulled apart, not cut, so that the surgeon can see theovaries. Then the ovaries, and often the fallopian tubes,are removed.\\nOophorectomy can sometimes be done with a laparo-\\nscopic procedure. With this surgery, a tube containing atiny lens and light source is inserted through a small inci-sion in the navel. A camera can be attached that allows thesurgeon to see the abdominal cavity on a video monitor.When the ovaries are detached, they are removed thougha small incision at the top of the vagina. The ovaries canalso be cut into smaller sections and removed.\\nThe advantages of abdominal incision are that the\\novaries can be removed even if a woman has many adhe-sions from previous surgery. The surgeon gets a goodview of the abdominal cavity and can check the sur-rounding tissue for disease. A vertical abdominal inci-sion is mandatory if cancer is suspected. The disadvan-tages are that bleeding is more likely to be a complica-tion of this type of operation. The operation is morepainful than a laparoscopic operation and the recoveryperiod is longer. A woman can expect to be in the hospi-tal two to five days and will need three to six weeks toreturn to normal activities.\\nPreparation\\nBefore surgery, the doctor will order blood and urine\\ntests, and any additional tests such as ultrasound or xrays to help the surgeon visualize the woman’s condition.The woman may also meet with the anesthesiologist toevaluate any special conditions that might affect theadministration of anesthesia. A colon preparation may bedone, if extensive surgery is anticipated.\\nOn the evening before the operation, the woman\\nshould eat a light dinner, then take nothing by mouth,including water or other liquids, after midnight.\\nAftercare\\nAfter surgery a woman will feel discomfort.

Ifeven part of one ovary remains, it will produce enoughestrogen that a woman will continue to menstruate, unlessher uterus was removed in a hysterectomy. Antibiotics are\\ngiven to reduce the risk of post-surgery infection.\\nReturn to normal activities takes anywhere from two\\nto six weeks, depending on the type of surgery. Whenwomen have cancer, chemotherapy or radiation are oftengiven in addition to surgery. Some women have emotion-al trauma following an oophorectomy, and can benefitfrom counseling and support groups.\\nRisks\\nOophorectomy is a relatively safe operation, al-\\nthough, like all major surgery, it does carry some risks.These include unanticipated reaction to anesthesia, inter-nal bleeding, blood clots, accidental damage to otherorgans, and post-surgery infection.\\nComplications after an oophorectomy include\\nchanges in sex drive, hot flashes, and other symptoms ofmenopause if both ovaries are removed.

Thecondition can be caused by any of several neurologic dis-orders. It may be myopathic, meaning that the musclescontrolling eye movement are directly involved, or neu-rogenic, meaning that the nerve pathways controlling eyemuscles are affected. Diseases associated with ophthal-moplegia are ocular myopathy, which affects muscles,and internuclear ophthalmoplegia, a disorder caused bymultiple sclerosis , a disease which affects nerves.\\nDescription\\nBecause the eyes do not move together in ophthal-\\nmoplegia, patients may complain of double vision. Dou-ble vision is especially troublesome if the ophthalmople-gia comes on suddenly or affects each eye differently.Because ophthalmoplegia is caused by another, underly-ing disease, it is often associated with other neurologicsymptoms, including limb weakness, lack of coordina-tion, and numbness.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nOcular myopathy is also known as mitochondrial\\nencephalomyelopathy with ophthalmoplegia or progres-sive external ophthalmoplegia. Because it is so often asso-ciated with diseases affecting many levels of the neuro-logic system, it is often referred to as “ophthalmoplegiaplus.” The main feature is progressive limitation of eyemovements, usually with drooping of the eyelids ( ptosis ).\\nPtosis may occur years before other symptoms of oph-thalmoplegia. Because both eyes are equally involved andbecause ability to move the eyes lessens gradually overthe course of years, double vision is rare. On examination,the eyelids may appear thin. This disease usually beginsin childhood or adolescence but may start later.\\nWhen ophthalmoplegia is caused by muscle degen-\\neration (myopathic), muscle biopsy, in which a smallpiece of muscle is surgically removed and examinedmicroscopically, will find characteristic abnormal musclefibers called ragged red fibers. In this form of ophthal-moplegia, the patient may experience weakness of theface, the muscles involved in swallowing, the neck, orthe limbs.\\nProgressive external ophthalmoplegia is sometimes\\nassociated with specific neurologic syndromes. Thesesyndromes include familial forms of spastic paraplegia,spinocerebellar disorders, or sensorimotor peripheral\\nneuropathy . Kearns-Sayre syndrome causes ophthalmo-\\nplegia along with loss of pigment in the retina, the light-sensitive membrane lining the eye. In addition, the dis-ease may cause heart block that must be corrected with\\na pacemaker, increased protein in the cerebrospinal fluid,and a progressively disabling lack of muscular coordina-tion (cerebellar syndrome). Symptoms of the diseaseappear before age 15.\\nSome of the progressive external ophthalmoplegia\\nsyndromes are unusual in that inheritance is controlledby DNA in the mitochondria. The mitochondria are rod-shaped structures within a cell that convert food to usableenergy. Most inherited diseases are passed on by DNA inthe cell nucleus, the core that contains the hereditarymaterial. Mitochondrial inheritance tends to be passed onby the mother. Other forms of progressive external oph-thalmoplegia are not inherited but occur sporadicallywith no clear family history. It is not known why someforms are neurogenic and others are myopathic.

In this syn-drome, the eye on the same side as the damaged mediallongitudinal fasciculus is unable to look outward (that is,the left eye cannot look left). The other eye exhibits jerk-ing movements ( nystagmus ) when the patient tries to\\nlook left. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia may be seenrarely without multiple sclerosis in patients with certaintypes of cancer or with Chiari type II malformation.\\nEye movement disorders and ophthalmoplegia can\\nalso be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy ,t h y -\\nroid disease, diabetes mellitus , brainstem tumors,\\nmigraine, basilar artery stroke , pituitary stroke, myas-\\nthenia gravis ,muscular dystrophy , and the Fisher vari-\\nant of Guillain-Barré syndrome . A tumor or aneurysm\\nin the cavernous sinus, located behind the eyes, can causepainful ophthalmoplegia. Painful ophthalmoplegia canalso be caused by an inflammatory process in the samearea, called Tolosa-Hunt syndrome.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe patient’s medical and family history and the\\nexamination findings will usually help differentiate thevarious syndromes associated with ophthalmoplegia. Inaddition, each syndrome is associated with characteristicfeatures, such as nystagmus or ptosis. All patients withprogressive external ophthalmoplegia should have a mus-cle biopsy to look for ragged red fibers or changes sug-gesting muscular dystrophy. A sample should be sent foranalysis of mitochondrial DNA. Electromyogram(EMG), measurement of electrical activity in the muscle,helps diagnose myopathy.\\nComputed tomography scan (CT scan) or magnetic\\nresonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain may be\\nneeded to rule out brain tumor , stroke, aneurysm, or\\nmultiple sclerosis. When multiple sclerosis is suspected,evoked potential testing of nerve response may also behelpful. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid may showchanges characteristic of multiple sclerosis or Kearns-Sayre syndrome. Other tests that may be helpful inKearns-Sayre include electrocardiogram (measuringelectrical activity of the heart muscles), retinal examina-tion, and a hearing test (audiogram). For possible myas-thenia gravis, the Tensilon (edrophonium) test should bedone. Tests should also be done to measure activity of thecell-surface receptors for acetylcholine, a chemical thathelps pass electrical impulses along nerve cells in themuscles. Thyroid disease and diabetes mellitus should beexcluded by appropriate blood work.KEY TERMS\\nCerebellar —Involving the cerebellum, which con-\\ntrols walking, balance, and coordination.\\nCerebrospinal fluid —Fluid bathing the brain and\\nspinal cord.\\nHeart block —A problem with electrical conduc-\\ntion in the heart muscle that may lead to irregularheart beat and require a pacemaker for treatment.\\nMitochondria —Spherical or rod shaped parts of\\nthe cell. Mitochondria contain genetic material(DNA and RNA) and are responsible for convert-ing food to energy.\\nTreatment\\nThere are no specific cures for ocular myopathy or\\nprogressive external ophthalmoplegia. Vitamin E therapyhas been used to treat Kearns-Sayre syndrome. Coen-zyme Q (ubiquinone), a naturally occurring substancesimilar to vitamin K, is widely used to treat other formsof progressive external ophthalmoplegia, but the degreeof success varies. Specific treatments are available formultiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, diabetes mellitus,and thyroid disease. Symptoms of ophthalmoplegia canbe relieved by mechanical treatment. Surgical procedurescan lift drooping eyelids or a patch over one eye can beused to relieve double vision. Because there is no blinkresponse, a surgically lifted eyelid exposes the cornea ofthe eye so that it may become dry or be scratched. Thesecomplications must be avoided by using artificial tearsand wearing eyepatches at night. In Kearns-Sayre syn-drome, a pacemaker may be needed.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis of progressive external ophthalmople-\\ngia depends on the associated neurological problems; inparticular, whether there is severe limb weakness or cere-bellar symptoms that may be mild or disabling. As withmost chronic neurologic diseases, mortality increases withdisability. Progressive external ophthalmoplegia itself isnot a life-threatening condition. Kearns-Sayre syndrome isdisabling, probably shortens the life span, and few if anypatients have children. Overall life expectancy for multiplesclerosis patients is seven years less than normal; death\\nrates are higher for women than for men.\\nPrevention\\nThere is no way to prevent ophthalmoplegia.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2395Ophthalmoplegia'),\n",

Thecourse of oppositional defiant disorder varies amongpatients. In males, the disorder is more common amongthose who had problem temperaments or high motoractivity in the preschool years. During the school years,patients may have low self-esteem, changing moods, anda low frustration tolerance. Patients may swear and usealcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs at an early age. Thereare often conflicts with parents, teachers, and peers.\\nChildren with this disorder show their negative and\\ndefiant behaviors by being persistently stubborn andresisting directions. They may be unwilling to compro-mise, give in, or negotiate with adults. Patients maydeliberately or persistently test limits, ignore orders,argue, and fail to accept blame for misdeeds. Hostility isdirected at adults or peers and is shown by verbal aggres-sion or deliberately annoying others.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nOppositional defiant disorder is more common in\\nboys than girls and the disorder typically begins by ageeight. Although the specific causes of the disorder areunknown, parents who are overly concerned with powerand control may cause an eruption to occur. Symptomsoften appear at home, but over time may appear in othersettings as well. Usually the disorder occurs graduallyover months or years. Several theories about the causesof oppositional defiant disorder are being investigated.Oppositional defiant disorder may be related to:\\n• the child’s temperament and the family’s response to\\nthat temperament\\n• an inherited predisposition to the disorder in some fam-\\nilies\\n• a neurological cause, like a head injury\\n• a chemical imbalance in the brain (especially with the\\nbrain chemical serotonin)\\nOppositional defiant disorder appears to be more\\ncommon in families where at least one parent has a histo-ry of a mood disorder, conduct disorder , attention\\ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder, antisocial personality dis-order, or a substance-related disorder. Additionally, somestudies suggest that mothers with a depressive disorderare more likely to have children with oppositional behav-ior. However, it is unclear to what extent the mother’sdepression results from or causes oppositional behaviorin children.\\nSymptoms include a pattern of negative, hostile, and\\ndefiant behavior lasting at least six months. During thistime four or more specific behaviors must be present.These behaviors include the child who:\\n• often loses his/her temper\\n• often argues with adults• often actively defies or refuses to comply with adults’\\nrequests or rules\\n• often deliberately annoys people• often blames others for his/her mistakes or misbehavior\\n• is often touchy or easily annoyed by others\\n• is often angry and resentful• is often spiteful or vindictive• misbehaves\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2396Oppositional defiant disorder'),\n",

Criteria are not met for conduct disor-\\nder, and, if the child is 18 years old or older, criteria arenot met for antisocial personality disorder. In otherwords, a child with oppositional defiant disorder does notshow serious aggressive behaviors or exhibit the physicalcruelty that is common in other disorders.\\nAdditional problems may be present, including:\\n• learning problems• a depressed mood• hyperactivity (although attention deficit/hyperactivity\\ndisorder must be ruled out)\\n• substance abuse or dependence\\n• dramatic and erratic behavior\\nThe patient with oppositional defiant disorder is\\nmoody, easily frustrated, and may abuse drugs.\\nDiagnosis\\nWhile psychological testing may be needed, the doc-\\ntor must examine and talk with the child, talk with theparents, and review the medical history. Oppositionaldefiant disorder rarely travels alone. Children with atten-tion/deficit hyperactive disorder will also have opposi-tional defiant disorder 50% of the time. Children withdepression/anxiety will have oppositional defiant disor-der 10–29% of the time. Because all of the features ofthis disorder are usually present in conduct disorder,oppositional defiant disorder is not diagnosed if the crite-ria are met for conduct disorder.\\nA diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder should\\nbe considered only if the behaviors occur more frequent-ly and have more serious consequences than is typicallyobserved in other children of a similar developmentalstage. Further, the behavior must lead to significantimpairment in social, school, or work functioning.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of oppositional defiant disorder usually\\nconsists of group, individual and/or family therapy , and\\neducation. Of these, individual therapy is the most com-mon. Therapy can provide a consistent daily schedule,support, consistent rules, discipline, and limits. It canalso help train patients to get along with others and modi-fy behaviors. Therapy can occur in residential, day treat-ment, or medical settings. Additionally, having a healthyrole model as an example is important for the patient.KEY TERMS\\nAttention deficit/hyperactivity disorder — A per-\\nsistent pattern of inattention, hyperactivity and/orimpulsiveness; the pattern is more frequent andsevere than is typically observed in people at asimilar level of development.\\nConduct disorder —A repetitive and persistent pat-\\ntern of behavior in which the basic rights of othersare violated or major age-appropriate rules ofsociety are broken.\\nParent management training focuses on teaching the\\nparents specific and more effective techniques for han-dling the child’s opposition and defiance. Research hasshown that parent management training is more effectivethan family therapy.\\nWhether involved in therapy or working on this dis-\\norder at home, the patient must work with his or her par-ents’ guidance to make the fullest possible recovery.According to the New York Hospital/Cornell MedicalCenter, the patients must:\\n• use self timeouts\\n• identify what increases anxiety\\n• talk about feelings instead of acting on them\\n• find and use ways to calm themselves• frequently remind themselves of their goals• get involved in tasks and physical activities that provide\\na healthy outlet for energy\\n• learn how to talk with others• develop a predictable, consistent, daily schedule of\\nactivity\\n• develop ways to obtain pleasure and feel good• learn how to get along with other people• find ways to limit stimulation• learn to admit mistakes in a matter-of-fact way\\nStimulant medication is used only when opposition-\\nal defiant disorder coexists with attention deficit/hyper-activity disorder.

Optic atrophy may also be referred to asoptic nerve head pallor because of the pale appearance ofthe optic nerve head as seen at the back of the eye. Possi-ble causes of optic atrophy include: optic neuritis ,\\nLeber’s hereditary optic atrophy, toxic or nutritionaloptic neuropathy, glaucoma , vascular disorders, trauma,\\nand other systemic disorders.\\nDescription\\nThe process of vision involves light entering the eye\\nand triggering chemical changes in the retina, a pigment-ed layer lining the back of the eye. Nerve impulses creat-ed by this process travel to the brain via the optic nerve.Using a hand-held instrument called an ophthalmoscope,the doctor can see the optic nerve head (optic disc) whichis the part of the optic nerve that enters at the back of theeyeball. In optic atrophy, the disc is pale and has fewerblood vessels than normal.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSymptoms of optic atrophy are a change in the optic\\ndisc and a decrease in visual function. This change invisual function can be a decrease in sharpness and clarityof vision (visual acuity) or decreases in side (peripheral)vision. Color vision and contrast sensitivity can also beaffected.\\nThere are many possible causes of optic atrophy.\\nThe causes can range from trauma to systemic disorders.Some possible causes of optic atrophy include:\\n• Optic neuritis. Optic neuritis is an inflammation of the\\noptic nerve. It may be associated with eye pain wors-\\nened by eye movement. It is more common in young tomiddle-aged women. Some patients with optic neuritismay develop multiple sclerosis later on in life.\\n• Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy. This is a disease of\\nyoung men (late teens, early 20s), characterized by anonset over a few weeks of painless, severe, central visualloss in one eye, followed weeks or months later by thesame process in the other eye. At first the optic disc maybe slightly swollen, but eventually there is optic atrophy.The visual loss is generally permanent. This condition ishereditary. If a patient knows that Leber’s runs in thefamily, genetic counseling should be considered.\\n• Toxic optic neuropathy. Nutritional deficiencies and poi-\\nsons can be associated with gradual vision loss and opticatrophy, or with sudden vision loss and optic discswelling. Toxic and nutritional optic neuropathies areuncommon in the United States, but took on epidemicproportions in Cuba in 1992–1993. The most commontoxic optic neuropathy is known as tobacco-alcoholamblyopia , thought to be caused by exposure to cyanide\\nfrom tobacco smoking , and by low levels of vitamin B\\n12\\nbecause of poor nutrition and poor absorption associat-\\ned with drinking alcohol. Other possible toxins includedethambutol, methyl alcohol (moonshine), ethylene gly-col (antifreeze), cyanide, lead, and carbon monoxide.Certain medications have also been implicated. Nutri-tional optic neuropathy may be caused by deficiencies ofprotein, or of the B vitamins and folate, associated with\\nstarvation , malabsorption, or alcoholism .\\n• Glaucoma. Glaucoma may be caused by an increase of\\npressure inside the eye. This increased pressure mayeventually affect the optic nerve if left untreated.\\n• Compressive optic neuropathy. This is the result of a\\ntumor or other lesion putting pressure on the optic\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2398Optic atrophy'),\n",

Another possible cause is enlargement of muscles\\ninvolved in eye movement seen in hyperthyroidism\\n(Graves’ disease).\\n• Retinitis pigmentosa. This is a hereditary ocular disorder.\\n• Syphilis. Left untreated, this disease may result in optic\\natrophy.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis involves recognizing the characteristic\\nchanges in the optic disc with an ophthalmoscope, and mea-suring visual acuity, usually with an eye chart. Visual fieldtesting can test peripheral vision. Color vision and contrastsensitivity can also be tested. Family history is important inthe diagnosis of inherited conditions. Exposure to poisons,drugs, and even medications should be determined. Sus-pected poisoning can be confirmed through blood and urine\\nanalysis, as can vitamin deficiency.\\nBrain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may\\nshow a tumor or other structure putting pressure on theoptic nerve, or may show plaques characteristic of multi-ple sclerosis, which is frequently associated with opticneuritis. However, similar MRI lesions may appear inLeber’s hereditary optic neuropathy. Mitochondrial DNAtesting can be done on a blood sample, and can identifythe mutation responsible for Leber’s.\\nVisual evoked potentials (VEP), which measure\\nspeed of conduction over the nerve pathways involved insight, may detect abnormalities in the clinically unaffect-ed eye in early cases of Leber’s. Fluorescein angiogra-\\nphygives more detail about blood vessels in the retina.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of optic neuritis with steroids is contro-\\nversial. Currently, there is no known treatment forLeber’s hereditary optic neuropathy. Treatment of othercauses of optic atrophy varies depending upon the under-lying disease.\\nPrognosis\\nMany patients with optic neuritis eventually develop\\nmultiple sclerosis. Most patients have a gradual recoveryof vision after a single episode of optic neuritis, evenwithout treatment. Prognosis for visual improvement inLeber’s hereditary optic neuropathy is poor, with the spe-cific rate highly dependent on which mitochondrial DNAmutation is present. If the cause of toxic or nutritionaldeficiency optic neuropathy can be found and treatedearly, such as stopping smoking and taking vitamins intobacco-alcohol amblyopia, vision generally returns tonear normal over several months’ time. However, visualloss is often permanent in cases of long-standing toxic ornutritional deficiency optic neuropathy.KEY TERMS\\nAtrophy —A destruction or dying of cells, tissues,\\nor organs.\\nCerebellar —Involving the part of the brain (cere-\\nbellum), which controls walking, balance, andcoordination.\\nMitochondia —A structure in the cell responsible for\\nproducing energy.

Patients should also go for regularvision exams. Patients should ask their doctor howoften that should be, as certain conditons may warrantmore frequent exams.

It typically occurs in one eye at a time (70%), andthe resulting vision loss is rapid and progressive, but onlytemporary. Thirty percent of patients experience occur-rence in both eyes. Optic neuritis tends to afflict youngadults with an average age in their 30s. Seventy-five per-cent of patients with optic neuritis are women.\\nNerve damage that occurs in the section of the optic\\nnerve located behind the eyeball, is called retrobulbar\\nneuritis , and is most often associated with multiple scle-\\nrosis . Optic nerve inflammation and edema (swelling)\\ncaused by intracranial pressure at the place where thenerve enters the eyeball is termed papillitis .\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSymptoms of optic neuritis include one or more of\\nthe following:\\n• blurred or dimmed vision\\n• blind spots, particularly with central vision• pain with eye movement•headache\\n• sudden color blindness• impaired night vision• impaired contrast sensitivity\\nOptic neuritis is most commonly associated with\\nmultiple sclerosis (MS). Other causes include viral orfungal infections, encephalomyelitis, autoimmune dis-eases, or pressure on the nerve from tumors or vasculardiseases (i.e., temporal arteritis ). Some toxins, such as\\nmethanol and lead, can also damage the optic nerve, ascan long-term abuse of alcohol and tobacco. Patientswith non-MS related optic neuritis are usually immuno-compromised in some way.\\nDiagnosis\\nAn ophthalmologist, a physician trained in diseases\\nof the eye, will typically make a diagnosis of optic neuri-tis. A complete visual exam, including a visual acuitytest, color vision test, and examination of the retina andoptic disc with an ophthalmoscope, will be performed.Clinical signs such as impaired pupil response may beapparent during an eye exam, but in some cases the eyemay appear normal. A medical history will also be per-formed to determine if exposure to toxins such as leadmay have caused the optic neuritis.\\nFurther diagnostic testing such as magnetic reso-\\nnance imaging (MRI) may be necessary to confirm a\\ndiagnosis of optic neuritis. An MRI can also reveal signsof multiple sclerosis.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of optic neuritis depends on the underly-\\ning cause of the condition. Vision loss resulting from aviral condition usually resolves itself once the virus istreated, and optic neuritis resulting from toxin damagemay improve once the source of the toxin is removed.\\nA course of intravenous corticosteroids (steroids)\\nfollowed by oral steroids has been found to be helpful inrestoring vision quickly to patients with MS-relatedepisodes of optic neuritis, but its efficacy in preventingrelapse is debatable. The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial(ONTT) has shown that IV steroids may be effective inreducing the onset of MS for up to two years, but furtherstudies are necessary. Oral prednisone has been found toincrease the likelihood of recurrent episodes of optic neu-ritis, and is not recommended for treating the disorder.\\nPrognosis\\nThe vision loss associated with optic neuritis is usually\\ntemporary. Spontaneous remission occurs in two to eightweeks. Sixty-five to eighty percent of patients can expect20/30 or better vision after recovery. Long-term prognosisdepends on the underlying cause of the condition. If a viralinfection has triggered the episode, it frequently resolvesitself with no after effects. If optic neuritis is associatedwith multiple sclerosis, future episodes are not uncommon.Thirty-three percent of optic neuritis cases recur within fiveyears. Each recurrence results in less recovery and worsen-ing vision. There is a strong association between optic neu-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2400Optic neuritis'),\n",

They are also known as the Pill,\\nOCs, or birth control pills.KEY TERMS\\nAtrophy —Cell wasting or death.\\nMultiple sclerosis —An autoimmune disease of the\\ncentral nervous system characterized by damageto the myelin sheath that covers nerves.\\nTemporal arteritis —Also known as giant cell arteri-\\ntis. Inflammation of the large arteries located in thetemples which is marked by the presence of giantcells and symptoms of headache and facial pain.\\nVisual acuity test —An eye examination that deter-\\nmines sharpness of vision, typically performed byidentifying objects and/or letters on an eye chart.Purpose\\nOral contraceptives, also known as birth control\\npills, contain artificially made forms of two hormonesproduced naturally in the body. These hormones, estro-gen and progestin, regulate a woman’s menstrual cycle.When taken in the proper amounts, following a specificschedule, oral contraceptives are very effective in pre-venting pregnancy. Studies show that less than one ofevery one hundred women who use oral contraceptivescorrectly becomes pregnant during the first year of use.\\nThese pills have several effects that help prevent preg-\\nnancy. For pregnancy to occur, an egg must become matureinside a woman’s ovary, be released, and travel to the fal-lopian tube. A male sperm must also reach the fallopiantube, where it fertilizes the egg. Then the fertilized eggmust travel to the woman’s uterus (womb), where it lodgesin the uterus lining and develops into a fetus. The main waythat oral contraceptives prevent pregnancy is by keeping anegg from ripening fully. Eggs that do not ripen fully cannotbe fertilized. In addition, birth control pills thicken mucusin the woman’s body through which the sperm has to swim.This makes it more difficult for the sperm to reach the egg.Oral contraceptives also change the uterine lining so that afertilized egg cannot lodge there to develop.\\nBirth control pills may cause good or bad side\\neffects. For example, a woman’s menstrual periods areregular and usually lighter when she is taking oral con-traceptives, and the pills may reduce the risk of ovarian\\ncysts , breast lumps, pelvic inflammatory disease , and\\nother medical problems. However, taking birth controlpills increases the risk of heart attack ,stroke , and blood\\nclots in certain women. Serious side effects such as theseare more likely in women over 35 years of age whosmoke cigarettes and in those with specific health prob-lems such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or a historyof breast or uterine cancer . A woman who wants to use\\noral contraceptives should ask her physician for the latestinformation on the risks and benefits of all types of birthcontrol and should consider her age, health, and medicalhistory when deciding what to use.\\nPrecautions\\nNo form of birth control (except not having sex) is\\n100% effective. However, oral contraceptives can behighly effective when used properly. Discuss the optionswith a health care professional.\\nOral contraceptives do not protect against AIDS or\\nother sexually transmitted diseases .

Follow the instructions of the physician who pre-scribed the medicine.\\nSmoking cigarettes while taking oral contraceptives\\ngreatly increases the risk of serious side effects. Women\\nwho take oral contraceptives should not smoke cigarettes.\\nSeeing a physician regularly while taking this medi-\\ncine is very important. The physician will note unwantedside effects. Follow his or her advice on how often youshould be seen.\\nAnyone taking oral contraceptives should be sure to\\ntell the health care professional in charge before havingany surgical or dental procedures, laboratory tests, oremergency treatment.\\nThis medicine may increase sensitivity to sunlight.\\nWomen using oral contraceptives should avoid too muchsun exposure and should not use tanning beds, tanningbooths, or sunlamps until they know how the medicineaffects them. Some women taking oral contraceptivesmay get brown splotches on exposed areas of their skin.These usually go away over time after the women stoptaking birth control pills.\\nOral contraceptives may cause the gums to become\\ntender and swollen or to bleed. Careful brushing andflossing, gum massage, and regular cleaning may helpprevent this problem. Check with a physician or dentist ifgum problems develop.\\nWomen who have certain medical conditions or who\\nare taking certain other medicines may have problems ifthey take oral contraceptives. Before taking these drugs, besure to let the physician know about any of these conditions:\\nALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions\\nto estrogens or progestins in the past should let her physi-cian know before taking oral contraceptives. The physi-cian should also be told about any allergies to foods,\\ndyes, preservatives, or other substances.\\nPREGNANCY. Women who become pregnant or think\\nthey may have become pregnant while taking birth con-trol pills should stop taking them immediately and checkwith their physicians. Women who want to start takingoral contraceptives again after pregnancy should not refilltheir old prescriptions without checking with their physi-cians. The physician may need to change the prescription.\\nBREASTFEEDING. Women who are breastfeeding\\nshould check with their physicians before using oral con-traceptives. The hormones in the pills may reduce theamount of breast milk and may cause other problems inbreastfeeding. They may also cause jaundice and\\nenlarged breasts in nursing babies whose mothers takethe medicine.OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Oral contraceptives\\nmay improve or worsen some medical conditions. Thepossibility that they may make a condition worse doesnot necessarily mean they cannot be used. In some cases,women may need only to be tested or followed moreclosely for medical problems while using oral contracep-tives. Before using oral contraceptives, women with anyof these medical problems should make sure their physi-cians are aware of their conditions:\\n• Female conditions such as menstrual problems, endo-\\nmetriosis , or fibroid tumors of the uterus. Birth control\\npills usually make these problems better, but may some-times make them worse or more difficult to diagnose.\\n• Heart or circulation problems; recent or past blood clots\\nor stroke. Women who already have these problemsmay be at greater risk of developing blood clots or cir-culation problems if they use oral contraceptives. How-ever, healthy women who do not smoke may lower theirrisk of circulation problems and heart disease by takingthe pills.\\n• Breast cysts, lumps, or other noncancerous breast prob-\\nlems. Oral contraceptives generally protect againstthese conditions, but physicians may recommend morefrequent breast exams for women taking the pills.\\n•Breast cancer or other cancer (now or in the past, or\\nfamily history). Oral contraceptives may make someexisting cancers worse. Women with a family history ofbreast cancer may need more frequent screening for thedisease if they decide to take birth control pills.\\n• Migraine headaches. This condition may improve or\\nmay get worse with the use of birth control pills.\\n• Diabetes. Blood sugar levels may increase slightly\\nwhen oral contraceptives are used. Usually this increaseis not enough to affect the amount of diabetes medicineneeded. However, blood sugar will need to be moni-tored closely while taking oral contraceptives.\\n• Depression. This condition may worsen in women who\\nalready have it or may (rarely) occur again in womenwho were depressed in the past.\\n• Gallbladder disease, gallstones , high blood cholesterol,\\nor chorea gravidarum (a nervous disorder). Oral contra-ceptives may make these conditions worse.\\n• Epilepsy, high blood pressure, heart or circulation prob-\\nlems. By increasing fluid build-up, oral contraceptivesmay make these conditions worse.\\nDescription\\nOral contraceptives (birth control pills) come in a\\nwide range of estrogen-progestin combinations. Thepills in use today contain much lower doses of estrogen\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2402Oral contraceptives'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 109}, page_content='than those available in the past, and this change has\\nreduced the likelihood of serious side effects. Some pillscontain only progestin. These are prescribed mainly forwomen who need to avoid estrogens and may not be aseffective in preventing pregnancy as the estrogen-prog-estin combinations.\\nThese medicines come in tablet form, in containers\\ndesigned to help women keep track of which tablet totake each day. The tablets are different colors, indicatingamounts of hormones they contain. Some may containno hormones at all. These are included simply to helpwomen stay in the habit of taking a pill every day, as thehormone combination needs to be taken only on certaindays of the menstrual cycle. Keeping the tablets in theiroriginal container and taking them exactly on schedule isvery important. They will not be as effective if they aretaken in the wrong order or if doses are missed.\\nOral contraceptives are available only with a physi-\\ncian’s prescription. Some commonly used brands areDemulen, Desogen, Loestrin, Lo/Ovral, Nordette, Ortho-Novum, Ortho-Tri-Cyclen, Estrostep, Ortho-cept,Alesse, Levlite and Ovcon.\\nThe dose schedule depends on the type of oral con-\\ntraceptive. The two basic schedules are a 21-day sched-ule and a 28-day schedule. On the 21-day schedule, take1 tablet a day for 21 days, then skip 7 days and repeat thecycle. On the 28-day schedule, take one tablet a day for28 days; then repeat the cycle. Be sure to carefully followthe instructions provided with the medicine. For addi-tional information or explanations, check with the physi-cian who prescribed the medicine or the pharmacist whofilled the prescription.\\nTaking doses more than 24 hours apart may increase\\nthe chance of side effects or pregnancy. Try to take themedicine at the same time every day. Take care not to runout of pills. If possible, keep an extra month’s supply onhand and replace it every month with the most recentlyfilled prescription.\\nTry not to miss a dose, as this increases the risk of\\npregnancy. If a dose is missed, follow the package direc-tions or check with the physician who prescribed themedicine for instructions. It may be necessary to useanother form of birth control for some time after missinga dose.\\nTaking this medicine with food or at bedtime will\\nhelp prevent nausea, a side effect that sometimes occursduring the first few weeks. This side effect usually goesaway as the body adjusts to the medicine.\\nTaking oral contraceptives may have several benefits\\noutside of their ability to prevent pregnancy. Researchindicates that with 10 to 12 years of oral contraceptiveuse, a woman’s risk of ovarian cancer is reduced by up\\nto 80%. There may also be an approximate 50% decreasein the rate of endometrial cancers in women. One otherwell-known, noncontraceptive benefit of oral contracep-tives is an improvement in acne . The combination oral\\ncontraceptive ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate has beenapproved by the Food and Drug Administration for thetreatment of acne. Another positive effect of oral contra-ceptive use is improvement in abnormal uterine bleeding.Older women may also benefit from using oral contra-ceptives, because the pills can increase bone mass aswomen enter their menopausal years, when osteoporosis\\nis a growing concern.\\nOral contraceptives may also be used on an emer-\\ngency basis as a means of preventing pregnancy inwomen who have had unprotected intercourse. Twoproducts specifically designed for this purpose are Pre-ven and Plan B. In 2001, the American College of Obste-tricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended thatemergency oral contraceptives be available as an over-the-counter medicine. The Food and Drug Administra-tion, however, has not yet approved any measures thatwould allow this to happen.\\nRisks\\nTaking oral contraceptives with certain other drugs\\nmay affect the way the drugs work or may increase thechance of side effects.\\nSide Effects\\nSerious side effects are rare in healthy women who\\ndo not smoke cigarettes. In women with certain healthproblems, however, oral contraceptives may cause prob-lems such as liver cancer , noncancerous liver tumors,\\nblood clots, or stroke. Health care professionals can helpwomen weigh the benefits of being protected againstunwanted pregnancy against the risks of possible healthproblems.\\nThe most common minor side effects are nausea; vom-\\niting; abdominal cramping or bloating; breast pain, tender-\\nness or swelling; swollen ankles or feet; tiredness; andacne. These problems usually go away as the body adjuststo the drug and do not need medical attention unless theycontinue or they interfere with normal activities.\\nOther side effects should be brought to the attention\\nof the physician who prescribed the medicine. Checkwith the physician as soon as possible if any of the fol-lowing side effects occur:\\n• menstrual changes, such as lighter periods or missed\\nperiods, longer periods, or bleeding or spotting betweenperiods\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2403Oral contraceptives'),\n",

Swartout-Corbeil, R.N.\\nOral herpes seeCold sore\\nOral hygiene\\nDefinition\\nOral hygiene is the practice of keeping the mouth\\nclean and healthy by brushing and flossing to preventtooth decay and gum disease.\\nPurpose\\nThe purpose of oral hygiene is to prevent the build-\\nup of plaque, the sticky film of bacteria and food thatforms on the teeth. Plaque adheres to the crevices and fis-sures of the teeth and generates acids that, when notremoved on a regular basis, slowly eat away, or decay, theprotective enamel surface of the teeth, causing holes (cav-ities) to form. Plaque also irritates gums and can lead togum disease ( periodontal disease ) and tooth loss. Tooth-\\nbrushing and flossing remove plaque from teeth, and anti-septic mouthwashes kill some of the bacteria that helpform plaque. Fluoride—in toothpaste, drinking water, ordental treatments—also helps to protect teeth by bindingwith enamel to make it stronger. In addition to such dailyoral care, regular visits to the dentist promote oral health.Preventative services that he or she can perform includefluoride treatments, sealant application, and scaling(scraping off the hardened plaque, called tartar). The den-tist can also perform such diagnostic services as x-rayimaging and oral cancer screening as well as such treat-\\nment services as fillings, crowns, and bridges.\\nPrecautions\\nMaintaining oral hygiene should be a lifelong habit.\\nAn infant’s gums and, later, teeth should be kept clean bywiping them with a moist cloth or a soft toothbrush.However, only a very small amount (the size of a pea) oftoothpaste containing fluoride should be used since toomuch fluoride may be toxic to infants.\\nAn adult who has partial or full dentures should also\\nmaintain good oral hygiene. Bridges and dentures mustbe kept clean to prevent gum disease. Dentures should berelined and adjusted by a dentist as necessary to maintainproper fit so the gums do not become red, swollen, andtender.\\nBrushing and flossing should be performed thorough-\\nly but not too vigorously. Rough mechanical action mayirritate or damage sensitive oral tissues. Sore or bleedinggums may be experienced for the first few days after floss-ing is begun. However, bleeding continuing beyond oneweek should be brought to the attention of a dentist. As ageneral rule, any sore or abnormal condition that does notdisappear after 10 days should be examined by a dentist.\\nDescription\\nBrushing\\nBrushing should be performed with a toothbrush and\\na fluoride toothpaste at least twice a day and preferablyafter every meal and snack. Effective brushing must cleaneach outer tooth surface, inner tooth surface, and the flatchewing surfaces of the back teeth. To clean the outer andinner surfaces, the toothbrush should be held at a 45-degree angle against the gums and moved back and forthin short strokes (no more than one toothwidth distance).To clean the inside surfaces of the front teeth, the tooth-brush should be held vertically and the bristles at the tip(called the toe of the brush) moved gently up and downagainst each tooth. To clean the chewing surfaces of thelarge back teeth, the brush should be held flat and movedback and forth. Finally, the tongue should also be brushedusing a back-to-front sweeping motion to remove foodparticles and bacteria that may sour the breath.\\nToothbrushes wear out and should be replaced every\\nthree months. Consumers should look for toothbrushes\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2405Oral hygiene'),\n",

The toothbrush handlemay be modified by inserting it into a rubber ball for eas-ier gripping.\\nFlossing\\nFlossing once a day helps prevent gum disease by\\nremoving food particles and plaque at and below thegumline as well as between teeth. To begin, most of an18-in (45-cm) strand of floss is wrapped around the thirdfinger of one hand. A 1-in (2.5-cm) section is thengrasped firmly between the thumb and forefinger of eachhand. The floss is eased between two teeth and workedgently up and down several times with a rubbing motion.At the gumline, the floss is curved first around one toothand then the other with gentle sliding into the spacebetween the tooth and gum. After each tooth contact iscleaned, a fresh section of floss is unwrapped from onehand as the used section of floss is wrapped around thethird finger of the opposite hand. Flossing proceedsbetween all teeth and behind the last teeth. Flossingshould also be performed around the abutment (support)teeth of a bridge and under any artificial teeth using adevice called a floss threader.\\nDental floss comes in many varieties (waxed, unwaxed,\\nflavored, tape) and may be chosen on personal preference.For people who have difficulty handling floss, floss holdersand other types of interdental (between the teeth) cleaningaids, such as brushes and picks, are available.\\nRisks\\nNegative consequences arise from improper or infre-\\nquent brushing and flossing. The five major oral healthproblems are plaque, tartar, gingivitis, periodontitis, andtooth decay.\\nPlaque is a soft, sticky, colorless bacterial film that\\ngrows on the hard, rough surfaces of teeth. These bacte-ria use the sugar and starch from food particles in themouth to produce acid. Left to accumulate, this aciddestroys the outer enamel of the tooth, irritates the gumsto the point of bleeding, and produces foul breath. Plaquestarts forming again on teeth four to 12 hours after brush-ing, so brushing a minimum of twice a day is necessaryfor adequate oral hygiene.\\nWhen plaque is not regularly removed by brushing\\nand flossing, it hardens into a yellow or brown mineraldeposit called tartar or calculus. This formation is crustyand provides additional rough surfaces for the growth ofplaque.

The septum divides the\\neyelid into outer and inner areas. This orbital septumhelps prevent the spread of infection to the eye socket.Periorbital and orbital cellulitis are more common inchildren than in adults. Periorbital cellulitis, whichaccounts for 85–90% of all ocular cellulitis, usuallyoccurs in children under the age of five. Responsible forthe remaining 10–15% of these infections, orbital celluli-tis is most common in children over the age of five.\\nThese conditions usually begin with swelling or\\ninflammation of one eye. Infection spreads rapidly andcan cause serious problems that affect the eye or thewhole body.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nOrbital and periorbital cellulitis are usually caused\\nby infection of the sinuses near the nose. Insect bites orinjuries that break the skin cause about one-third of thesecellulitis infections. Orbital and periorbital cellulitis mayalso occur in people with a history of dental infections.\\nThe blood of about 33 of every 100 patients with\\norbital or periorbital cellulitis contains bacteria known tocause:\\n• acute ear infections• inflammation of the epiglottis (the cartilage flap that\\ncovers the opening of the windpipe during swallowing)\\n•meningitis (inflammation of the membranes that enclose\\nand protect the brain)\\n• pneumonia\\n• sinus infection\\nPeople with periorbital cellulitis will have swollen,\\npainful lids and redness, but probably no fever . About one\\nchild in five has a runny nose, and 20% have conjunctivi-\\ntis. Conjunctivitis, also called pinkeye, is an inflamma-\\ntion of the mucous membrane that lines the eyelid andcovers the front white part of the eye. It can be caused byallergy, irritation, or bacterial or viral infection.\\nAs well as a swollen lid, other symptoms of orbital\\ncellulitis include:\\n• bulging or displacement of the eyeball (proptosis)• chemosis (swelling of the mucous membrane of the\\neyeball and eyelid as a result of infection, injury, or sys-temic disorders like anemia or kidney disease)\\n• diminished ability to see clearly\\n• eye pain\\n•f e v e r\\n• paralysis of nerves that control eye movements ( oph-\\nthalmoplegia )\\nDiagnosis\\nAn eye doctor may use special instruments to open a\\nswollen lid in order to:\\n• examine the position of the eyeball• evaluate eye movement\\n• test the patient’s vision\\nIf the source of infection is not apparent, the position\\nof the eyeball may suggest its location. Computed tomog-\\nraphy scans (CT scans) can indicate which sinuses and\\nbones are involved or whether abscesses have developed.\\nTreatment\\nA child who has orbital or periorbital cellulitis should\\nbe hospitalized without delay. Antibiotics are used to stop\\nthe spread of infection and prevent damage to the opticnerve, which transmits visual images to the brain.\\nSymptoms of optic-nerve damage or infection that\\nhas spread to sinus cavities close to the brain include:\\n• very limited ability to move the eye\\n• impaired response of the pupil to light and other stimulus• loss of visual acuity\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2407Orbital and periorbital cellulitis'),\n",

A\\nmechanical injury to the groin area may also cause orchi-tis. Fifteen to twenty-five percent of males past the age ofpuberty with mumps develop orchitis. Epididymo-orchi-\\ntis (inflammation of both testis and part of the spermaticduct) is the most common bacterial type of Orchitis. Thisform of the condition occurs most often in sexuallyactive males fifteen years and older, and in men over 45with enlarged prostates.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe people most susceptible to orchitis are those\\nwith inadequate mumps inoculation and, in the case ofsexually transmitted orchitis, those who practice unsafesex or have a history of sexually transmitted disease.Inadequate protection of the groin area during contactsports or other potentially harmful physical activities mayresult in injury leading to orchitis. Symptoms of orchitisinclude swelling of one or both testicles, tenderness in thegroin area, fever, headache , and nausea. Symptoms may\\nalso include bloody discharge from the penis, and painduring urination, intercourse, or ejaculation.\\nDiagnosis\\nIn most cases, Orchitis can be diagnosed by an urolo-\\ngist, general practitioner, or emergency room physician.Diagnosis is usually based on the results of a physical\\nexamination and patient history. Other testing may include\\na urinalysis and urine culture , screening for chlamydia\\nand gonorrhea, ultrasound imaging, or blood tests.\\nTreatment\\nElevation and support of the scrotum, and the applica-\\ntion of cold packs to the groin area give some relief fromthe pain of orchitis. Medication for pain such as codeineand meperidine may be given. Only the symptoms of viralmumps orchitis are treated. Antibiotics are used to allevi-\\nate orchitis that is bacterial in origin. Sexually transmittedorchitis (especially when resultant from chlamydia or gon-orrhea) is often treated with the antibiotic Ceftriaxone inconjunction with azithromycin or doxycycline.\\nAlternative treatment\\nFor relief from swelling, the drinking of dandelion tea\\nis recommended in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).\\nAnother traditional Chinese treatment for swelling is theapplication of a poultice of ground dandelion and aloe to\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2408Orchitis'),\n",

Atrophy of the scrotum occurs in 60% oforchitis cases. However, hormonal function is not affect-ed and resulting sterility is rare from mumps.\\nPrevention\\nKeeping mumps inoculations current and diligently\\npracticing safe sex are the best ways to prevent orchitisfrom occurring.

It may also deal with some problems of the ner-vous system, such as those that arise from injury of thespine. These problems can occur at birth, through injury,or as the result of aging . They may be acute, as in injury,\\nor chronic, as in many aging-related problems.\\nOrthopedics comes from two Greek words, ortho ,\\nmeaning straight and pais, meaning child. Originally\\northopedic surgeons dealt with bone deformities in chil-dren, using braces to straighten the child’s bones. Withthe development of anesthesia and an understanding ofthe importance of aseptic technique in surgery, orthopedicsurgeons extended their role to include surgery involvingthe bones and related nerves and connective tissue.\\nThe terms orthopedic surgeon and orthopedist are\\nused interchangeably today to indicate a medical doctorwith special certification in orthopedics.\\nMany orthopedic surgeons maintain a general prac-\\ntice, while some specialize in one particular aspect oforthopedics, such as hand surgery, joint replacements, ordisorders of the spine. Orthopedics treats both acute andchronic disorders. Some orthopedists specialize in trau-ma medicine and can be found in emergency rooms andtrauma centers treating injuries. Others find their workoverlapping with plastic surgeons, geriatric specialists,pediatricians, or podiatrists ( foot care specialists). A\\nrapidly growing area of orthopedics is sports medicine,and many sports medicine doctors are board certifiedorthopedists.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2409Orthopedic surgery'),\n",

Patients looking for aqualified orthopedist should inquire if they are “boardcertified” by their accrediting organization.\\nDescription\\nThe range of treatments done by orthopedists is\\nenormous. It can cover anything from traction to ampu-\\ntation , hand reconstruction to spinal fusion or joint\\nreplacements. They also treat broken bones, strains andsprains, and dislocations. Some specific procedures doneby orthopedic surgeons are listed as separate entries inthis book, including arthroplasty ,arthroscopic\\nsurgery ,bone grafting ,fasciotomy ,fracture repair ,\\nkneecap removal , and traction.\\nIn general orthopedists are attached to a hospital,\\nmedical center, trauma center, or free-standing surgicalcenter where they work closely with a surgical teamincluding an anesthesiologist and surgical nurse. Ortho-pedic surgery can be performed under general, regional,or local anesthesia.\\nMuch of the work of the surgeon involves adding\\nforeign material to the body in the form of screws, wires,pins, tongs, and prosthetics to hold damaged bones intheir proper alignment or to replace damaged bone orconnective tissue. Great improvements have been madein the development of artificial limbs and joints, and inthe materials available to repair damage to bones andconnective tissue. As developments occur in the fields ofmetallurgy and plastics, changes will take place in ortho-pedic surgery that will allow the surgeon to more nearlyduplicate the natural functions of the bones, joints, andligaments, and to more accurately restore damaged partsto their original range of motion.\\nPreparation\\nPatients are usually referred to an orthopedic sur-\\ngeon by a general physical or family doctor. Prior to anysurgery, the patient undergoes extensive testing to deter-mine the proper corrective procedure. Tests may includex rays, computed tomography scans (CT scans), mag-\\nnetic resonance imaging (MRI), myelograms, diagnos-\\ntic arthroplasty, and blood tests. The orthopedist willdetermine the history of the disorder and any treatmentsthat were tried previously. A period of rest to the injuredpart may be recommended before surgery is prescribed.\\nPatients undergo standard blood and urine tests before\\nsurgery and, for major surgery, may be given an electro-cardiogram or other diagnostic tests prior to the operation.KEY TERMS\\nArthroplasty —The surgical reconstruction or\\nreplacement of a joint.\\nProsthesis —A synthetic replacement for a missing\\npart of the body, such as a knee or a hip.\\nRange of motion —The normal extent of move-\\nment (flexion and extension) of a joint.\\nPatients may choose to give some of their own blood to be\\nheld in reserve for their use in major surgery, such as kneereplacement, where heavy bleeding is common.\\nAftercare\\nRehabilitation from orthopedic injuries can be a\\nlong, arduous task. The doctor will work closely withphysical therapists to assure that the patient is receivingtreatment that will enhance the range of motion andreturn function to the affected part.\\nRisks\\nAs with any surgery, there is always the risk of\\nexcessive bleeding, infection, and allergic reaction toanesthesia. Risks specifically associated with orthopedicsurgery include inflammation at the site where foreignmaterial (pins, prosthesis) is introduced into the body,infection as the result of surgery, and damage to nervesor to the spinal cord.\\nNormal results\\nThousands of people have successful orthopedic\\nsurgery each year to recover from injuries or restore lostfunction. The degree of success in individual recoveriesdepends on the age and general health of the patient, themedical problem being treated, and the patient’s willing-ness to comply with rehabilitative therapy after thesurgery.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nWalton, John, Paul Beeson, and Ronald B.

This may leadto fainting .\\nDescription\\nWhen a person stands upright, a certain amount of\\nblood normally pools in the veins of the ankles and legs.This pooling means that there is slightly less blood for theheart to pump and causes a drop in blood pressure. Usual-ly, the body responds to this drop so quickly, a person isunaware of the change. The brain tells the blood vesselsto constrict so they have less capacity to carry blood, andat the same time tells the heart to beat faster and harder.These responses last for a very brief time. If the body’sresponse to a change in vertical position is slow or absent,the result is orthostatic hypotension. It is not a true dis-ease, but the inability to regulate blood pressure quickly.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nOrthostatic hypotension has many possible causes.\\nThe most common cause is medications used to treatother conditions. Diuretics reduce the amount of fluid in\\nthe body which reduces the volume of blood. Medicinesused to expand the blood vessels increase the vessel’sability to carry blood and so lower blood pressure.\\nIf there is a severe loss of body fluid from vomiting,\\ndiarrhea , untreated diabetes, or even excessive sweat-\\ning, blood volume will be reduced enough to lower bloodpressure. Severe bleeding can also result in orthostatichypotension.\\nAny disease or spinal cord injury that damages the\\nnerves which control blood vessel diameter can causeorthostatic hypotension.\\nSymptoms of orthostatic hypotension include faint-\\nness, dizziness , confusion, or blurry vision, when stand-ing up quickly. An excessive loss of blood pressure can\\ncause a person to pass out.\\nDiagnosis\\nWhen a person experiences any of the symptoms\\nabove, a physician can confirm orthostatic hypotension ifthe person’s blood pressure falls significantly on stand-ing up and returns to normal when lying down. Thephysician will then look for the cause of the condition.\\nTreatment\\nWhen the cause of orthostatic hypotension is related\\nto medication, it is often possible to treat it by reducingdosage or changing the prescription. If it is caused bylow blood volume, an increase in fluid intake and reten-tion will solve the problem.\\nMedications designed to keep blood pressure from\\nfalling can be used when they will not interfere withother medical problems.\\nWhen orthostatic hypotension cannot be treated, the\\nsymptoms can be significantly reduced by rememberingto stand up slowly or by wearing elastic stockings.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for people who have orthostatic\\nhypotension depends on the underlying cause of theproblem.\\nPrevention\\nThere is no way to prevent orthostatic hypotension,\\nsince it is usually the result of another medical condition.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nGodbey, Susan Flagg, and Stephen George. “Up, Not Out,\\nFlexing Checks Dizziness and Fainting.” Prevention Mag-\\nazine 49, no. 2 (Feb. 1997): 38+.\\nORGANIZATIONS\\nNational Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

The nameosteoarthritis comes from three Greek words meaningbone, joint, and inflammation.\\nDescription\\nOA is one of the most common causes of disability\\ndue to limitations of joint movement, particularly in peo-ple over 50. It is estimated that 2% of the United Statespopulation under the age of 45 suffers from osteoarthri-tis; this figure rises to 30% of persons between 45 and64, and 63–85% in those over 65. About 90% of theAmerican population will have some features of OA intheir weight-bearing joints by age 40. Men tend to devel-op OA at earlier ages than women.\\nOA occurs most commonly after 40 years of age and\\ntypically develops gradually over a period of years.Patients with OA may have joint pain on only one side of\\nthe body and it primarily affects the knees, hands, hips,feet, and spine.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nOsteoarthritis results from deterioration or loss of\\nthe cartilage that acts as a protective cushion betweenbones, particularly in weight-bearing joints such as theknees and hips. As the cartilage is worn away, the boneforms spurs, areas of abnormal hardening, and fluid-filled pockets in the marrow known as subchondral cysts.As the disorder progresses, pain results from deforma-tion of the bones and fluid accumulation in the joints.The pain is relieved by rest and made worse by movingthe joint or placing weight on it. In early OA, the pain isminor and may take the form of mild stiffness in themorning. In the later stages of OA, inflammation devel-ops; the patient may experience pain even when the jointis not being used; and he or she may suffer permanentloss of the normal range of motion in that joint.Until the late 1980s, OA was regarded as an inevitable\\npart of aging , caused by simple “wear and tear” on the\\njoints. This view has been replaced by recent research intocartilage formation. OA is now considered to be the endresult of several different factors contributing to cartilagedamage, and is classified as either primary or secondary.\\nPrimary osteoarthritis\\nPrimary OA results from abnormal stresses on\\nweight-bearing joints or normal stresses operating onweakened joints. Primary OA most frequently affects thefinger joints, the hips and knees, the cervical and lumbarspine, and the big toe. The enlargements of the fingerjoints that occur in OA are referred to as Heberden’s andBouchard’s nodes. Some gene mutations appear to beassociated with OA. Obesity also increases the pressure\\non the weight-bearing joints of the body. Finally, as thebody ages, there is a reduction in the ability of cartilage torepair itself. In addition to these factors, some researchershave theorized that primary OA may be triggered byenzyme disturbances, bone disease, or liver dysfunction.\\nSecondary osteoarthritis\\nSecondary OA results from chronic or sudden injury\\nto a joint. It can occur in any joint. Secondary OA isassociated with the following factors:\\n• trauma, including sports injuries• repetitive stress injuries associated with certain occupa-\\ntions (like the performing arts, construction or assemblyline work, computer keyboard operation, etc.)\\n• repeated episodes of gout or septic arthritis\\n• poor posture or bone alignment caused by developmen-\\ntal abnormalities\\n• metabolic disorders\\nDiagnosis\\nHistory and physical examination\\nThe two most important diagnostic clues in the\\npatient’s history are the pattern of joint involvement andthe presence or absence of fever , rash, or other symp-\\ntoms outside the joints. As part of the physical examina-\\ntion, the doctor will touch and move the patient’s joint to\\nevaluate swelling, limitations on the range of motion,pain on movement, and crepitus (a cracking or grindingsound heard during joint movement).\\nDiagnostic imaging\\nThere is no laboratory test that is specific for\\nosteoarthritis. Treatment is usually based on the resultsof diagnostic imaging. In patients with OA, x rays may\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2412Osteoarthritis'),\n",

The patient’s symptoms, however, do not alwayscorrelate with x ray findings. Magnetic resonance\\nimaging (MRI) and computed tomography scans (CT\\nscans) can be used to determine more precisely the loca-tion and extent of cartilage damage.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of OA patients is tailored to the needs of\\neach individual. Patients vary widely in the location ofthe joints involved, the rate of progression, the severity ofsymptoms, the degree of disability, and responses to spe-cific forms of treatment. Most treatment programsinclude several forms of therapy.Patient education and psychotherapy\\nPatient education is an important part of OA treat-\\nment because of the highly individual nature of the disor-der and its potential impacts on the patient’s life. Patientswho are depressed because of changes in employment orrecreation usually benefit from counseling. The patient’sfamily should be involved in discussions of coping,household reorganization, and other aspects of thepatient’s disease and treatment regimen.\\nMedications\\nPatients with mild OA may be treated only with pain\\nrelievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol). Most\\npatients with OA, however, are given nonsteroidal anti-\\ninflammatory drugs , or NSAIDs.

The NSAIDs havethe advantage of relieving inflammation as well as pain.They also have potentially dangerous side effects, includ-ing stomach ulcers, sensitivity to sun exposure, kidneydisturbances, and nervousness or depression.\\nSome OA patients are treated with corticosteroids\\ninjected directly into the joints to reduce inflammationand slow the development of Heberden’s nodes. Injec-tions should not be regarded as a first-choice treatmentand should be given only two or three times a year.\\nMost recently, a new class of NSAIDs, known as the\\ncyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors have been studiedand approved for the treatment of OA. These COX-2inhibitors work to block the enzyme COX-2, which stim-ulates inflammatory responses in the body. They work todecrease both the inflammation and joint pain of OA, butwithout the high risk of gastrointestinal ulcers and bleed-ing seen with the traditional NSAIDs. This is due to thefact that they do not block COX-1, which is anotherenzyme that has protective effects on the stomach lining.The COX-2 inhibitors included celecoxib (Celebrex) androfecoxib (Vioxx). Celecoxib is taken once or twicedaily, and rofecoxib once daily.\\nPhysical therapy\\nPatients with OA are encouraged to exercise as a\\nway of keeping joint cartilage lubricated. Exercises thatincrease balance, flexibility, and range of motion are rec-ommended for OA patients. These may include walking,swimming and other water exercises, yoga and other\\nstretching exercises, or isometric exercises.\\nPhysical therapy may also include massage, moist\\nhot packs, or soaking in a hot tub.\\nSurgery\\nSurgical treatment of osteoarthritis may include the\\nreplacement of a damaged joint with an artificial part orappliance; surgical fusion of spinal bones; scraping orremoval of damaged bone from the joint; or the removalof a piece of bone in order to realign the bone.\\nProtective measures\\nDepending on the location of the affected joint,\\npatients with OA may be advised to use neck braces orcollars, crutches, canes, hip braces, knee supports, bedboards, or elevated chair and toilet seats. They are alsoadvised to avoid unnecessary knee bending, stair climb-ing, or lifting of heavy objects.\\nNew treatments\\nSince 1997, several new methods of treatment for\\nOA have been investigated. Although they are still beingdeveloped and tested, they appear to hold promise. They\\ninclude:\\n• Disease-modifying drugs. These compounds may be\\nuseful in assisting the body to form new cartilage orimprove its repair of existing cartilage.\\n• Hyaluronic acid. Injections of this substance may help\\nto lubricate and protect cartilage, thereby promotingflexibility and reduced pain. These agents includehyaluronan (Hyalgan) and hylan G-F20 (Synvisc).\\n• Cartilage transplantation. This technique is presently\\nused in Sweden.\\nAlternative treatment\\nDiet\\nFood intolerance can be a contributing factor in OA,\\nalthough this is more significant in rheumatoid arthri-\\ntis. Dietary suggestions that may be helpful for people\\nwith OA include emphasizing high-fiber, complex-car-bohydrate foods, while minimizing fats. Plants in theSolanaceae family, such as tomatoes, eggplant, and pota-toes, should be avoided, as should refined and processedfoods.

It serves as\\nthe structural foundation of skin, bone, cartilage, and lig-aments. In osteogenesis imperfecta, the collagen pro-duced is abnormal and disorganized. This results in anumber of abnormalities throughout the body, the mostnotable being fragile, easily broken bones.\\nThere are four forms of OI, Types I through IV . Of\\nthese, Type II is the most severe, and is usually fatalwithin a short time after birth. Types I, III, and IV havesome overlapping and some distinctive symptoms, par-ticularly weak bones.\\nEvidence suggests that OI results from abnormali-\\nties in the collagen gene COL1A1 or COL1A2, and pos-sibly abnormalities in other genes. In OI Type I, II, andIII, the gene map locus is 17q21.31-q22, 7q22.1, and inOI Type IV , the gene map locus is 17q21.31-q22.\\nIn OI, the genetic abnormality causes one of two\\nthings to occur. It may direct cells to make an altered col-lagen protein and the presence of this altered collagencauses OI Type II, III, or IV . Alternately, the dominantaltered gene may fail to direct cells to make any collagenprotein. Although some collagen is produced by instruc-tions from the normal gene, an overall decrease in thetotal amount of collagen produced results in OI Type I.\\nA child with only one parent who is a carrier of a\\nsingle altered copy of the gene has no chance of actuallyhaving the disease, but a 50% chance of being a carrier.\\nIf both parents have OI caused by an autosomal\\ndominant gene change, there is a 75% chance that thechild will inherit one or both OI genes. In other words,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2416Osteogenesis imperfecta'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 123}, page_content='there is a 25% chance the child will inherit only the\\nmother’s OI gene (and the father’s unaffected gene), a25% chance the child will inherit only the father’s OIgene (and the mother’s unaffected gene), and a 25%chance the child will inherit both parents’ OI genes.Because this situation has been uncommon, the outcomeof a child inheriting two OI genes is hard to predict. It islikely that the child would have a severe, possibly lethal,form of the disorder.\\nAbout 25% of children with OI are born into a fami-\\nly with no history of the disorder. This occurs when thegene spontaneously mutates in either the sperm or theegg before the child’s conception. No triggers for thistype of mutation are known. This is called a new domi-nant mutation. The child has a 50% chance of passing thedisorder on to his or her children. In most cases, when afamily with no history of OI has a child with OI, they arenot at greater risk than the general population for havinga second child with OI, and unaffected siblings of a per-son with OI are at no greater risk of having children withOI than the general population.\\nIn studies of families into which infants with OI\\nType II were born, most of the babies had a new domi-nant mutation in a collagen gene. In some of these fami-lies, however, more than one infant was born with OI.Previously, researchers had seen this recurrence as evi-dence of recessive inheritance of this form of OI. Morerecently, however, researchers have concluded that therare recurrence of OI to a couple with a child with auto-somal dominant OI is more likely due to gonadalmosaicism. Instead of mutation occurring in an individ-ual sperm or egg, it occurs in a percentage of the cellsthat give rise to a parent’s multiple sperm or eggs. Thismutation, present in a percentage of his or her reproduc-tive cells, can result in more than one affected child with-out affecting the parent with the disorder. An estimated2%–4% of families into which an infant with OI Type IIis born are at risk of having another affected childbecause of gonadal mosaicism.\\nDemographics\\nOI affects equal numbers of males and females. It\\noccurs in about one of every 20,000 births.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nOI is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant\\ncondition. In autosomal dominant inheritance, a singleabnormal gene on one of the autosomal chromosomes(one of the first 22 “non-sex” chromosomes) from eitherparent can cause the disease. One of the parents will havethe disease (since it is dominant) and is the carrier. Onlyone parent needs to be a carrier in order for the child to\\ninherit the disease. A child who has one parent with thedisease has a 50% chance of also having the disease.\\nType I\\nThis is the most common and mildest type. Among\\nthe common features of Type I are the following:\\n• bones are predisposed to fracture, with most fractures\\noccurring before puberty , people with OI type I typi-\\ncally have about 20–40 fractures before puberty\\n• stature is normal or near-normal\\n• joints are loose and muscle tone is low• usually sclera (whites of the eyes) have blue, purple, or\\ngray tint\\n• face shape is triangular\\n• tendency toward scoliosis (a curvature of the spine)\\n• bone deformity is absent or minimal• dentinogenesis imperfecta may occur, causing brittle\\nteeth\\n• hearing loss is a possible symptom, often beginning in\\nearly 20s or 30s\\n• structure of collagen is normal, but the amount is less\\nthan normal\\nType II\\nSometimes called the lethal form, Type II is the most\\nsevere form of OI.

Collagen or DNA tests mayhelp confirm a diagnosis of OI. These tests generallyrequire several weeks before results are known. Approxi-mately 10–15% of individuals with mild OI who havecollagen testing, and approximately 5% of those whohave genetic testing , test negative for OI despite having\\nthe disorder.\\nDiagnosis is usually suspected when a baby has bone\\nfractures after having suffered no apparent injury. Anoth-er indication is small, irregular, isolated bones in thesutures between the bones of the skull (wormian bones).Sometimes the bluish sclera serves as a diagnostic clue.Unfortunately, because of the unusual nature of the frac-tures occurring in a baby who cannot yet move, some par-ents have been accused of child abuse before the actual\\ndiagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta was reached.Prenatal diagnosis\\nTesting is available to assist in prenatal diagnosis.\\nWomen with OI who become pregnant, or women whoconceive a child with a man who has OI, may wish toexplore prenatal diagnosis. Because of the relativelysmall risk (2–4%) of recurrence of OI Type II in a family,families may opt for ultrasound studies to determine if adeveloping fetus has the disorder.\\nUltrasound is the least invasive procedure for prena-\\ntal diagnosis, and carries the least risk. Using ultrasound,a doctor can examine the fetus’s skeleton for bowing ofthe leg or arm bones, fractures, shortening, or other boneabnormalities that may indicate OI. Different forms of OImay be detected by ultrasound in the second trimester.The reality is that when it occurs as a new dominantmutation, it is found inadvertantly on ultrasound, and itmay be difficult to know the diagnosis until after deliverysince other genetic conditions can cause bowing and/orfractures prenatally.\\nChorionic villus sampling is a procedure to obtain\\nchorionic villi tissue for testing. Examination of fetalcollagen proteins in the tissue can reveal informationabout the quantitative or qualitative collagen defects thatleads to OI. When a parent has OI, it is necessary for theaffected parent to have the results of his or her own colla-gen test available. Chorionic villus sampling can be per-formed at 10–12 weeks of pregnancy .\\nAmniocentesis is a procedure that involves inserting\\na thin needle into the uterus, into the amniotic sac, andwithdrawing a small amount of amniotic fluid. DNA canbe extracted from the fetal cells contained in the amnioticfluid and tested for the specific mutation known to causeOI in that family. This technique is useful only when themutation causing OI in a particular family has been iden-tified through previous genetic testing of affected familymembers, including previous pregnancies involving ababy with OI. Amniocentesis is performed at 16–18weeks of pregnancy.\\nTreatment\\nThere are no treatments available to cure OI, nor to\\nprevent most of its complications. Most treatments areaimed at treating the fractures and bone deformitiescaused by OI. Splints, casts, braces, and rods are all used.Rodding refers to a surgical procedure in which a metalrod is implanted within a bone (usually the long bones ofthe thigh and leg). This is done when bowing or repeatedfractures of these bones has interfered with a child’s abil-ity to begin to walk.\\nOther treatments include hearing aids and early cap-\\nping of teeth.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 126}, page_content='Causes and symptoms\\nStaphylococcus aureus , a bacterium, is the most\\ncommon organism involved in osteomyelitis. Other typesof organisms include the mycobacterium which causestuberculosis , a type of Salmonella bacteria in patients\\nwith sickle cell anemia, Pseudomonas aeurginosa in\\ndrug addicts, and organisms which usually reside in thegastrointestinal tract in the elderly. Extremely rarely, theviruses which cause chickenpox and smallpox have\\nbeen found to cause a viral osteomyelitis.\\nThere are two main ways that infecting bacteria find\\ntheir way to bone, resulting in the development ofosteomyelitis. These include:\\n• Spread via the bloodstream; 95% of these types of\\ninfections are due to Staphylococcus aureus . In this sit-\\nuation, the bacteria travels through the bloodstream toreach the bone. In children, the most likely site of infec-tion is within one of the long bones, particularly thethigh bone (femur), one of the bones of the lower leg(tibia), or the bone of the upper arm (humerus). This isbecause in children these bones have particularly exten-sive blood circulation, making them more susceptibleto invasion by bacteria. Different patterns of blood cir-culation in adults make the long bones less well-servedby the circulatory system. These bones are thereforeunlikely to develop osteomyelitis in adult patients.Instead, the bones of the spine (vertebrae) receive a lotof blood flow. Therefore, osteomyelitis in adults is mostlikely to affect a vertebra. Drug addicts may haveosteomyelitis in the pubic bone or clavicle.\\n• Spread from adjacent infected soft tissue; about 50% of\\nall such cases are infected by Staphylococcus aureus .\\nThis often occurs in cases where recent surgery orinjury has result in a soft tissue infection. The bacteriacan then spread to nearby bone, resulting inosteomyelitis. Patients with diabetes are particularlysusceptible to this source of osteomyelitis. The diabetesinterferes with both nerve sensation and good bloodflow to the feet. Diabetic patients are therefore prone todeveloping poorly healing wounds to their feet, which\\ncan then spread to bone, causing osteomyelitis.\\nAcute osteomyelitis refers to an infection which\\ndevelops and peaks over a relatively short period of time.In children, acute osteomyelitis usually presents itself aspain in the affected bone, tenderness to pressure over the\\ninfected area, fever and chills. Patients who develop\\nosteomyelitis, due to spread from a nearby area of softtissue infection, may only note poor healing of the origi-nal wound or infection.\\nAdult patients with osteomyelitis of the spine usual-\\nly have a longer period of dull, aching pain in the back,and no fever. Some patients note pain in the chest,abdomen, arm, or leg. This occurs when the inflamma-\\ntion in the spine causes pressure on a nerve root servingone of these other areas. The lower back is the most com-mon location for osteomyelitis. When caused by tubercu-losis, osteomyelitis usually affects the thoracic spine(that section of the spine running approximately from thebase of the neck down to where the ribs stop).\\nWhen osteomyelitis is not properly treated, a chron-\\nic (long-term) type of infection may occur. In this case,the infection may wax and wane indefinitely, despitetreatment during its active phases. An abnormal openingin the skin overlaying the area of bone infection (called asinus tract) may occasionally drain pus. This type ofsmoldering infection may also result in areas of deadbone, called sequestra. These areas occur when the infec-tion interferes with blood flow to a particular part of thebone. Such sequestra lack cells called osteocytes, whichin normal bone are continuously involved in the processof producing bony material.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of osteomyelitis involves several proce-\\ndures. Blood is usually drawn and tested to demonstratean increased number of the infection-fighting whiteblood cells (particularly elevated in children with acuteosteomyelitis). Blood is also cultured in a laboratory, aprocess which allows any bacteria present to multiply. Aspecimen from the culture is then specially treated, andexamined under a microscope to try to identify thecausative bacteria.\\nInjection of certain radioactive elements into the\\nbloodstream, followed by a series of x-ray pictures,called a scan (radionuclide scanning), will reveal areas ofbone inflammation. Another type of scan used to diag-nose osteomyelitis is called magnetic resonance imag-\\ning, or MRI\\nWhen pockets of pus are available, or overlaying\\nsoft tissue infection exists, these can serve as sources forsamples which can be cultured to allow identification ofbacteria present. A long, sharp needle can be used toobtain a specimen of bone (biopsy), which can then betested to attempt to identify any bacteria present.\\nTreatment\\nAntibiotics are medications used to kill bacteria.\\nThese medications are usually given through a needle ina vein (intravenously) for at least part of the time. In chil-dren, these antibiotics can be given by mouth after initialtreatment by vein. In adults, four to six weeks of intra-venous antibiotic treatment is usually recommended,along with bed-rest for part or all of that time.

Liquid garlic extract is sometimes\\nsuggested. Guided imagery can help induce relaxation\\nand improve pain, both of which are considered toimprove healing. Herbs such as echinacea (Echinacea\\nspp.), goldenseal ( Hydrastis canadensis ), Siberian gin-\\nseng ( Eleutherococcus senticosus ), and myrrh ( Com-\\nmiphora molmol ) are all suggested for infections. Juice\\ntherapists recommend drinking combinations of carrot,celery, beet, and cantaloupe juices. A variety of homeo-pathic remedies may be helpful, especially those used tocounter inflammation.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis varies depending on how quickly an\\ninfection is identified, and what other underlying condi-tions exist to complicate the infection. With quick,appropriate treatment, only about 5% of all cases ofacute osteomyelitis will eventually become chronicosteomyelitis.

Defectswere thought to be misalignments—parts out of place bytiny distances. Treating misalignments became a matterof restoring the parts to their natural arrangement byadjusting them.\\nAs medical science advanced, defining causes of\\ndisease and discovering cures, schools of osteopathyadopted modern science, incorporated it into their cur-riculum, and redefined their original theory of disease inlight of these discoveries. Near the middle of the 20thcentury the equivalance of medical education betweenosteopathy and allopathic medicine was recognized, andthe D.O. degree (Doctor of Osteopathy) was granted offi-\\ncial parity with the M.D. (Doctor of Medicine) degree.Physicians could adopt either set of initials.\\nHowever, osteopaths have continued their emphasis\\non the musculoskeletal system and their traditional focuson “whole person” medicine. As of 1998, osteopathsconstitute 5.5% of American physicians, approximately45,000. They provide 100 million patient visits a year.From its origins in the United States, osteopathy hasspread to countries all over the world.\\nPractice\\nOsteopaths, chiropractors, and physical therapists\\nare the experts in manipulations (adjustments). The placeof manipulation in medical care is far from settled, butmillions of patients find relief from it. Particularly backs,but also necks, command most of the attention of themusculoskeletal community. This community includesorthopedic surgeons, osteopaths, general and familyphysicians, orthopedic physicians, chiropractors, physi-cal therapists, massage therapists, specialists in orthoticsand prosthetics, and even some dentists and podiatrists.Many types of headaches also originate in the muscu-loskeletal system. Studies comparing different methodsof treating musculoskeletal back, head, and neck painhave not reached a consensus, in spite of the huge num-bers of people that suffer from it.\\nThe theory behind manipulation focuses on joints,\\nmostly those of the vertebrae and ribs. Some believethere is a very slight offset of the joint members—a sub-luxation. Others believe there is a vacuum lock of thejoint surfaces, similar to two suction cups stuck together.Such a condition would squeeze joint lubricant out andproduce abrasion of the joint surfaces with movement.Another theory focuses on weakness of the ligamentsthat support the joint, allowing it freedom to get intotrouble. Everyone agrees that the result produces pain,that pain produces muscle spasms and cramps , which\\nfurther aggravates the pain.\\nSome, but not all, practitioners in this field believe\\nthat the skull bones can also be manipulated. The skull is,in fact, several bones that are all moveable in infants.Whether they can be moved in adults is controversial.Other practitioners manipulate peripheral joints to relievearthritis and similar afflictions.\\nManipulation returns the joint to its normal configu-\\nration. There are several approaches. Techniques varyamong practitioners more than between disciplines.Muscle relaxation of some degree is often required forthe manipulation to be successful. This can be done withheat or medication. Muscles can also be induced to relaxby gentle but persistent stretching. The manipulation is\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2422Osteopathy\\nOsteopathic physician demonstrating the articulation of a\\nfoot. (Photo Researchers, Inc. Reproduced by permission.)'),\n",

A satisfying “pop” is evi-dence of success. Others prefer steady force until relax-ation permits movement.\\nReturn of the joint to its normal status may be only\\nthe first step in treating these disorders. There is a reasonfor the initial event. It may be a fall, a stumble, or a mildimpact, in which case the manipulation is a cure. On theother hand, there may be a postural misalignment (such asa short leg), a limp, or a stretched ligament that permitsthe joint to slip back into dysfunction. Tension, as well aspain, for emotional reasons causes muscles to tighten. Ifthe pain has been present for any length of time, there willalso be muscle deterioration. The osteopathic approach tothe whole person takes all these factors into account inreturning the patient to a state of health.\\nOther repairs may be needed. A short leg is thought\\nby some to be a subluxation in the pelvis that may bemanipulated back into position. Other short legs mayrequire a lift in one shoe. Long-standing pain requiresadditional methods of physical therapy to rehabilitatemuscles, correct posture, and extinguish habits thatarose to compensate for the pain. Medications thatrelieve muscle spasm and pain are usually part of thetreatment. Psychological problems may need attentionand medication.\\nRisks\\nManipulation has rarely caused problems. Once in a\\nwhile too forceful a thrust has damaged structures in theneck and caused serious problems. The most commonadverse event, though, is misdiagnosis. Cancers havebeen missed; surgical back disease has been ignored untilspinal nerves have been permanently damaged.\\nNormal results\\nMany patients find that one or a series of manipula-\\ntions cures long-standing pain. Other patients needrepeated treatments. Some do not respond at all. It isalways a good idea to reassess any treatment that is notproducing the expected results.KEY TERMS\\nOrthotics —Mechanical devices that assist func-\\ntion.\\nProsthetics —Mechanical devices that replace miss-\\ning body parts.Resources\\nPERIODICALS\\nBonner, T.

A potentially fatal condition that candeform bone structure and distort the appearance,osteopetrosis is also called chalk bones, ivory bones, ormarble bones.\\nDescription\\nOsteopetrosis occurs when bones are spongy or\\nporous, or new bone is repeatedly added to calcified car-tilage (hardened connective tissue).\\nBone density begins to increase at birth or earlier,\\nbut symptoms may not become evident until adulthood.In mild cases, bone density increases at gradual, irregularintervals until full adult height is attained. Some bonesare not affected.\\nMore severe osteopetrosis progresses at a rapid pace\\nand destroys bone structure. This condition involvesbones throughout the body, but the lower jaw is neveraffected.\\nTypes of osteopetroses\\nEarly-onset osteopetrosis can be fatal. The ends of\\nthe long bones of the arms and legs appear clubbed(widened and thickened) at birth, and bone density con-tinues to increase sporadically or without pause. Chil-dren with early-onset osteopetroses usually die beforethe age of two.\\nMalignant infantile osteopetrosis is usually discov-\\nered by the time a baby is a few months old.

Bone density increases as they age but does notaffect appearance, health, intelligence, or life span.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nOsteopetrosis is the result of a genetic defect that\\ncauses the body to add new bone more rapidly than exist-ing bone disintegrates.\\nWhen fibrous or bony tissue invades bone marrow\\nand displaces red blood cells, the patient may developanemia. Infection results when excess bone impairs theimmune system, and hemorrhage can occur when plateletproduction is disrupted. When the skeleton grows so thickthat nerves are unable to pass between bones, the patientmay have a stroke or become blind or deaf.\\nOther symptoms associated with osteopetrosis\\ninclude:\\n• bones that break easily and don’t heal properly• bruising\\n• convulsions• enlargement of the liver, lymph glands, or spleen• failure to thrive (delayed growth, weight gain, and devel-\\nopment)\\n• hydrocephalus (fluid on the brain)• macrocephaly (abnormal enlargement of the head)• paralysis or loss of control of muscles in the face or eyes\\nDiagnosis\\nOsteopetrosis is usually diagnosed when x rays\\nreveal abnormalities or increases in bone density. Bone\\nbiopsy can confirm the presence of osteopetrosis, but\\nadditional tests may be needed to distinguish one type ofthe disorder from another.\\nTreatment\\nHigh doses of vitamin D can stimulate cells respon-\\nsible for disintegration of old bone and significantly alle-viate symptoms of severe disease. Experimental interfer-on gamma 1-b therapy has been shown to reduce the riskof infection experienced by patients who are severely ill.\\nWhen bone overgrowth deforms the shape of the\\nskull, surgery may be required to relieve pressure on thebrain.

Over time,bone mass, and therefore bone strength, is decreased. As aresult, bones become fragile and break easily. Even asneeze or a sudden movement may be enough to break abone in someone with severe osteoporosis.\\nDescription\\nOsteoporosis is a serious public health problem.\\nSome 28 million people in the United States are affectedby this potentially debilitating disease, which is responsi-ble for 1.5 million fractures (broken bones) annually.\\nThese fractures, which are often the first sign of the dis-ease, can affect any bone, but the most common locationsare the hip, spine, and wrist. Breaks in the hip and spineare of special concern because they almost alwaysrequire hospitalization and major surgery, and may leadto other serious consequences, including permanent dis-ability and even death .\\nTo understand osteoporosis, it is helpful to under-\\nstand the basics of bone formation. Bone is living tissuethat’s constantly being renewed in a two-stage process(resorption and formation) that occurs throughout life. Inthe resorption stage, old bone is broken down andremoved by cells called osteoclasts. In the formationstage, cells called osteoblasts build new bone to replacethe old. During childhood and early adulthood, more boneis produced than removed, reaching its maximum massand strength by the mid-30s. After that, bone is lost at afaster pace than it’s formed, so the amount of bone in theskeleton begins to slowly decline. Most cases of osteo-porosis occur as an acceleration of this normal aging\\nprocess. That’s referred to as primary osteoporosis. Thecondition can also be caused by other disease processes orprolonged use of certain medications that result in boneloss—if so, it’s called secondary osteoporosis.\\nOsteoporosis occurs most often in older people and\\nin women after menopause . It affects nearly half of all\\nthose, men and women, over the age of 75. Women, how-ever, are five times more likely than men to develop thedisease. They have smaller, thinner bones than men tobegin with, and they lose bone mass more rapidly aftermenopause (usually around age 50), when they stop pro-ducing a bone-protecting hormone called estrogen. In thefive to seven years following menopause, women canlose about 20% of their bone mass. By age 65 or 70,though, men and women lose bone mass at the same rate.As an increasing number of men reach an older age,there’s more awareness that osteoporosis is an importanthealth issue for them as well.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA number of factors increase the risk of developing\\nosteoporosis. They include:\\n• Age. Osteoporosis is more likely as people grow older\\nand their bones lose tissue.\\n• Gender. Women are more likely to have osteoporosis\\nbecause they are smaller and so start out with lessbone. They also lose bone tissue more rapidly as theyage. While women commonly lose 30–50% of theirbone mass over their lifetimes, men lose only 20–33%of theirs.\\n• Race. Caucasian and Asian women are most at risk for\\nthe disease, but African American and Hispanic womencan get it too.\\n• Figure type. Women with small bones and those who\\nare thin are more liable to have osteoporosis.\\n• Early menopause. Women who stop menstruating early\\nbecause of heredity, surgery or lots of physical exercise\\nmay lose large amounts of bone tissue early in life.Conditions such as anorexia and bulimia may also leadto early menopause and osteoporosis.\\n• Lifestyle. People who smoke or drink too much, or\\ndon’t get enough exercise have an increased chance ofgetting osteoporosis.\\n• Diet. Those who don’t get enough calcium or protein\\nmay be more likely to have osteoporosis. That’s whypeople who constantly diet are more prone to the disease.\\nOsteoporosis is often called the “silent” disease,\\nbecause bone loss occurs without symptoms. Peopleoften don’t know they have the disease until a bonebreaks, frequently in a minor fall that wouldn’t normallycause a fracture. A common occurrence is compressionfractures of the spine. These can happen even after a\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2425Osteoporosis'),\n",

The fractures can cause severeback pain , but sometimes they go unnoticed—either\\nway, the vertebrae collapse down on themselves, and theperson actually loses height. The hunchback appearanceof many elderly women, sometimes called “dowager’s”hump or “widow’s” hump, is due to this effect of osteo-porosis on the vertebrae.\\nDiagnosis\\nCertain types of doctors may have more training and\\nexperience than others in diagnosing and treating peoplewith osteoporosis. These include a geriatrician, who spe-cializes in treating the aged; an endocrinologist, who spe-cializes in treating diseases of the body’s endocrine system(glands and hormones); and an orthopedic surgeon, whotreats fractures, such as those caused by osteoporosis.\\nBefore making a diagnosis of osteoporosis, the doc-\\ntor usually takes a complete medical history, conducts aphysical exam, and orders x rays, as well as blood andurine tests, to rule out other diseases that cause loss ofbone mass. The doctor may also recommend a bone den-\\nsity test . This is the only way to know for certain if\\nosteoporosis is present. It can also show how far the dis-ease has progressed.\\nSeveral diagnostic tools are available to measure the\\ndensity of a bone. The ordinary x ray is one, though it’sthe least accurate for early detection of osteoporosis,because it doesn’t reveal bone loss until the disease isadvanced and most of the damage has already been done.Two other tools that are more likely to catch osteoporosisat an early stage are computed tomography scans (CT\\nscans) and machines called densitometers, which aredesigned specifically to measure bone density.\\nThe CT scan, which takes a large number of x rays\\nof the same spot from different angles, is an accurate test,but uses higher levels of radiation than other methods.The most accurate and advanced of the densitometersuses a technique called DEXA (dual energy x-rayabsorptiometry). With the DEXA scan, a double x-raybeam takes pictures of the spine, hip, or entire body. Ittakes about 20 minutes to do, is painless, and exposes thepatient to only a small amount of radiation—about one-fiftieth that of a chest x ray .\\nDoctors don’t routinely recommend the test, partly\\nbecause access to densitometers is still not widely avail-able. People should talk to their doctors about their riskfactors for osteoporosis and if, and when, they should getthe test. Ideally, women should have bone density mea-sured at menopause, and periodically afterward, depend-ing on the condition of their bones. Men should be testedaround age 65. Men and women with additional risk fac-\\ntors, such as those who take certain medications, mayneed to be tested earlier.\\nTreatment\\nThere are a number of good treatments for primary\\nosteoporosis, most of them medications. Two new med-ications, alendronate and calcitonin (in nose spray form),have been approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Admin-istration). They provide people who have osteoporosiswith a variety of choices for treatment. For people withsecondary osteoporosis, treatment may focus on curingthe underlying disease.\\nDrugs\\nFor most women who’ve gone through menopause,\\nthe best treatment for osteoporosis is hormone replace-\\nment therapy (HRT), also called estrogen replacement\\ntherapy. Many women participate in HRT when theyundergo menopause, to alleviate symptoms such as hotflashes, but hormones have other important roles as well.They protect women against heart disease, the numberone killer of women in the United States, and they helpto relieve and prevent osteoporosis. HRT increases awoman’s supply of estrogen, which helps build newbone, while preventing further bone loss.\\nSome women, however, do not want to take hor-\\nmones, because some studies show they are linked to anincreased risk of breast cancer or uterine cancer . Other\\nstudies reveal the risk is due to increasing age. (Breastcancer tends to occur more often as women age.) Whetheror not a woman takes hormones is a decision she shouldmake carefully with her doctor. Women should talk totheir doctors about personal risks for osteoporosis, as wellas their risks for heart disease and breast cancer. Mostwomen take estrogen along with a synthetic form of prog-esterone, another female hormone.The combination helpsprotect against cancer of the uterus.\\nFor people who can’t or won’t take estrogen, two\\nother medications can be good choices. These are alen-dronate and calcitonin. Alendronate and calcitonin bothstop bone loss, help build bone, and decrease fracturerisk by as much as 50%. Alendronate (sold under thename Fosamax) is the first nonhormonal medication forosteoporosis ever approved by the FDA. It attaches itselfto bone that’s been targeted by bone-eating osteoclasts. Itprotects the bone from these cells. Osteoclasts help yourbody break down old bone tissue.\\nCalcitonin is a hormone that’s been used as an injec-\\ntion for many years. A new version is on the market as anasal spray. It too slows down bone-eating osteoclasts.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2426Osteoporosis'),\n",

That’s why estrogen medications may still bethe medicine of choice for a few years, as researcherscontinue to study other drugs. Several medications understudy include other biphosphonates that slow bonebreakdown (like alendronate), sodium fluoride, vitaminD metabolites, and selective estrogen receptor modula-tors. Some of these treatments are already being used inother countries, but have not yet been approved by theFDA for use in the United States.\\nSurgery\\nUnfortunately, much of the treatment for osteoporo-\\nsis is for fractures that result from advanced stages of thedisease. For complicated fractures, such as broken hips,hospitalization and a surgical procedure are required. Inhip replacement surgery, the broken hip is removed andreplaced with a new hip made of plastic, or metal andplastic. Though the surgery itself is usually successful,complications of the hip fracture can be serious. Thoseindividuals have a 5–20% greater risk of dying within thefirst year following that injury than do others in their agegroup. A large percentage of those who survive areunable to return to their previous level of activity, andmany end up moving from self-care to a supervised liv-ing situation or nursing home. That’s why getting earlytreatment and taking steps to reduce bone loss are vital.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments for osteoporosis focus on\\nmaintaining or building strong bones. A healthy diet lowin fats and animal products and containing whole grains,fresh fruits and vegetables, and calcium-rich foods (suchas dairy products, dark-green leafy vegetables, sardines,salmon, and almonds), along with nutritional supplements(such as calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D), andweight-bearing exercises are important components ofboth conventional prevention and treatment strategies andalternative approaches to the disease. In addition, alterna-tive practitioners recommend a variety of botanical medi-cines or herbal supplements. Herbal supplementsdesigned to help slow bone loss emphasize the use of cal-cium-containing plants, such as horsetail ( Equisetum\\narvense ), oat straw ( Avena sativa ), alfalfa ( Medicago sati-\\nva), licorice ( Glycyrrhiza galbra ), marsh mallow ( Althaea\\nofficinalis ), and yellow dock ( Rumex crispus ). Homeo-\\npathic remedies focus on treatments believed to help thebody absorb calcium. These remedies are likely to includesuch substances as Calcarea carbonica (calcium carbon-\\nate) or silica. In traditional Chinese medicine , practi-\\ntioners recommend herbs thought to slow or prevent boneloss, including dong quai ( Angelica sinensis ) and Asian\\nginseng ( Panax ginseng ). Natural hormone therapy, using\\nplant estrogens (from soybeans) or progesterone (fromwild yams), may be recommended for women who can-not or choose not to take synthetic hormones.\\nPrognosis\\nThere is no cure for osteoporosis, but it can be con-\\ntrolled. Most people who have osteoporosis fare wellonce they get treatment.

This cre-ates a need for an alternate way for feces or urine to leavethe body. An opening is surgically created in theabdomen for body wastes to pass through. The surgicalprocedure is called an ostomy. The opening that is creat-ed at the end of the bowel or ureter is called a stoma,which is pulled through the abdominal wall.\\nDescription\\nDifferent types of ostomy are performed depending\\non how much and what part of the intestines or bladder isremoved.\\nThe three most common types of ostomies are:\\n•colostomy\\n• ileostomy• urostomy\\nColostomy\\nA colostomy is a when a small portion of the colon\\n(large intestine) is brought to the surface of the abdomi-nal wall to allow stool to be eliminated. A colostomymay be temporary or permanent. A permanent colostomyusually involves the loss of the rectum.\\nA colostomy might be performed due to cancer ,\\ndiverticulitis, imperforate anus, Hirschsprung’s disease ,\\nor trauma to the affected area.\\nIleostomy\\nAn ileostomy is an opening created in the small\\nintestine to bypass the colon for stool elimination. Theend of the ileum, which is the lowest part of the smallintestine, is brought through the abdominal wall to forma stoma.\\nIleoanal reservoir surgery is an alternative to a per-\\nmanent ileostomy. It requires two surgical procedures.The first removes the colon and rectum and a temporaryileostomy is created. The second procedure creates aninternal pouch from a portion of the small intestine tohold stool. This is then attached to the anus. Since themuscle of the rectum is left in place, there is control overbowel movements.\\nAn ileostomy might be performed due to ulcerative\\ncolitis ,Crohn’s disease , or familial polyposis .\\nUrostomy\\nA urostomy is a surgical procedure that diverts urine\\naway from a diseased or defective bladder.

Gilles\\nOtitis externa\\nDefinition\\nOtitis externa refers to an infection of the ear canal,\\nthe tube leading from the outside opening of the ear intowards the ear drum.\\nDescription\\nThe external ear canal is a tube approximately 1 in\\n(2.5 cm) in length. It runs from the outside opening ofthe ear to the start of the middle ear, designated by theear drum or tympanic membrane. The canal is partly car-tilage and partly bone. In early childhood, the first two-thirds of the canal is made of cartilage, and the last one-third is made of bone. By late childhood, and lastingthroughout all of adulthood, this proportion is reversed,so that the first one-third is cartilage, and the last two-thirds is bone. The lining of the ear canal is skin, which isattached directly to the covering of the bone. Glandswithin the skin of the canal produce a waxy substancecalled cerumen (popularly called earwax). Cerumen isdesigned to protect the ear canal, repel water, and keepthe ear canal too acidic to allow bacteria to grow.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBacteria, fungi, and viruses have all been implicated\\nin causing ear infections called otitis externa. The mostcommon cause of otitis externa is bacterial infection. Theusual offenders include Pseudomonas aeruginosa ,Enter-\\nobacter aerogenes ,Proteus mirabilis ,Klebsiella pneu-\\nmoniae ,Staphylococcus epidermidis , and bacteria of the\\nfamily called Streptococci. Occasionally, fungi maycause otitis externa. These include Candida andAspergillus . Two types of viruses, called herpesvirus\\nhominis and varicella-zoster virus, have also been identi-fied as causing otitis externa.\\nOtitis externa occurs most often in the summer\\nmonths, when people are frequenting swimming poolsand lakes. Continually exposing the ear canal to moisturemay cause significant loss of cerumen. The delicate skinof the ear canal, unprotected by cerumen, retains mois-ture and becomes irritated. Without cerumen, the earcanal stops being appropriately acidic, which allows bac-teria the opportunity to multiply. Thus, the warm, moist,dark environment of the ear canal becomes a breedingground for bacteria.\\nOther conditions predisposing to otitis externa\\ninclude the use of cotton swabs to clean the ear canals.This pushes cerumen and normal skin debris back intothe ear canal, instead of allowing the ear canal’s normalcleaning mechanism to work, which would ordinarily\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2431Otitis externa\\nA close-up image of the ear of an elderly man suffering from\\nnon-infectious otitis externa.The skin in the ear canal andouter ear is scaly.

Also, putting other items into the ear can scratch thecanal, making it more susceptible to infection.\\nThe first symptom of otitis externa is often itching\\nof the ear canal. Eventually, the ear begins to feelextremely painful. Any touch, movement, or pressure onthe outside structure of the ear (auricle) may cause quitesevere pain . This is because of the way in which the skin\\nlining the ear canal is directly attached to the covering ofthe underlying bone. If the canal is sufficiently swollen,hearing may become muffled. The canal may appearswollen and red, and there may be evidence of greenish-yellow pus.\\nIn severe cases, otitis externa may have an accompa-\\nnying fever . Often, this indicates that the outside ear\\nstructure (auricle) has become infected as well. It willbecome red and swollen, and there may be enlarged andtender lymph nodes in front of, or behind, the auricle.\\nA serious and life-threatening otitis externa is called\\nmalignant otitis externa. This is an infection which mostcommonly affects patients who have diabetes, especiallythe elderly. It can also occur in other patients who haveweakened immune systems. In malignant otitis externa, apatient has usually had minor symptoms of otitis externafor some months, with pain and drainage. The causativebacteria is usually Pseudomonas aeruginosa . In malig-\\nnant otitis externa, this bacteria spreads from the externalcanal into all of the nearby tissues, including the bones ofthe skull. Swelling and destruction of these tissues maylead to damage of certain nerves, resulting in spasms ofthe jaw muscles or paralysis of the facial muscles. Other,\\nmore severe, complications of this very destructive infec-tion include meningitis (swelling and infection of the\\ncoverings of the spinal cord and brain), brain infection,or brain abscess (the development of a pocket of infec-\\ntion with pus).\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of uncomplicated otitis externa is usually\\nquite simple. The symptoms alone, of ear pain worsenedby any touch to the auricle, are characteristic of otitisexterna. Attempts to examine the ear canal will usuallyreveal redness and swelling. It may be impossible (due topain and swelling) to see much of the ear canal, but thisinability itself is diagnostic.\\nIf there is any confusion about the types of organ-\\nisms causing otitis externa, the canal can be gentlyswabbed to obtain a specimen. The organisms present inthe specimen can then be cultured (allowed to multiply)in a laboratory, and then viewed under a microscope toallow identification of the causative organisms.If the rare disease malignant otitis externa is suspect-\\ned, computed tomography scan (CT scan) or magnetic\\nresonance imaging (MRI) scans will be performed to\\ndetermine how widely the infection has spread withinbone and tissue. A swab of the external canal will notnecessarily reveal the actual causative organism, so someother tissue sample (biopsy) will need to be obtained.The CT or MRI will help the practitioner decide wherethe most severe focus of infection is located, in order toguide the choice of a biopsy site.\\nTreatment\\nAntibiotics which can be applied directly to the skin\\nof the ear canal (topical antibiotics) are usually excellentfor treatment of otitis externa. These are often combinedin a preparation which includes a steroid medication. Thesteroid helps cut down on the inflammation and swellingwithin the ear canal. Some practitioners prefer to insert acotton wick into the ear canal, leaving it there for about48 hours. The medications are applied directly to thewick, enough times per day to allow the wick to remaincontinuously saturated. After the wick is removed, themedications are then put directly into the ear canal threeto four times each day.\\nIn malignant otitis externa, antibiotics will almost\\nalways need to be given through a needle in the vein(intravenously or IV). If the CT or MRI scan reveals thatthe infection has spread extensively, these IV antibioticswill need to be continued for six to eight weeks. If theinfection is in an earlier stage, two weeks of IV antibioticscan be followed by six weeks of antibiotics by mouth.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis is excellent for otitis externa. It is\\nusually easily treated, although it may tend to recur incertain susceptible individuals. Left untreated, malignantotitis externa may spread sufficiently to cause death .\\nPrevention\\nKeeping the ear dry is an important aspect of pre-\\nvention of otitis externa. Several drops of a mixture ofalcohol and acetic acid can be put into the ear canal afterswimming to insure that it dries adequately.\\nThe most serious complications of malignant otitis\\nexterna can be avoided by careful attention to earlysymptoms of ear pain and drainage from the ear canal.Patients with conditions that put them at higher risk forthis infection (diabetes, conditions which weakened theimmune system) should always report new symptomsimmediately.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2432Otitis externa'),\n",

The external ear canal is that tube which\\nleads from the outside opening of the ear to the structurecalled the tympanic membrane. Behind the tympanicmembrane is the space called the middle ear. Within themiddle ear are three tiny bones, called ossicles. Sound (inthe form of vibration) causes movement in the eardrum,and then the ossicles. The ossicles transmit the sound to astructure within the inner ear, which sends it to the brainfor processing.\\nThe nasopharynx is that passageway behind the nose\\nwhich takes inhaled air into the breathing tubes leadingto the lungs. The eustachian tube is a canal which runsbetween the middle ear and the nasopharynx. One of thefunctions of the eustachian tube is to keep the air pres-sure in the middle ear equal to that outside. This allowsthe eardrum and ossicles to vibrate appropriately, so thathearing is normal.\\nBy age three, almost 85% of all children will have had\\notitis media at least once. Babies and children between theages of six months and six years are most likely to developotitis media. Children at higher risk factors for otitis mediainclude boys, children from poor families, Native Ameri-cans, Native Alaskans, children born with cleft palate orother defects of the structures of the head and face, andchildren with Down syndrome . Exposure to cigarette\\nsmoke significantly increases the risk of otitis media aswell as other problems affecting the respiratory system.Also, children who enter daycare at an early age havemore upper respiratory infections (URIs or colds), andthus more cases of otitis media. The most usual times ofyear for otitis media to strike are in winter and early spring(the same times URIs are most common).\\nOtitis media is an important problem, because it\\noften results in fluid accumulation within the middle ear(effusion). The effusion can last for weeks to months.Effusion within the middle ear can cause significanthearing impairment. When such hearing impairmentoccurs in a young child, it may interfere with the devel-opment of normal speech.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe first thing necessary for the development of oti-\\ntis media is exposure to an organism capable of causingthe infection. These include a variety of viruses, as wellas such bacteria as Streptococcus pneumoniae (causes\\nabout 35% of all acute ear infections), Haemophilus\\ninfluenzae (causes about 23% of all acute ear infections),\\nor Moraxella catarrhalis (causes about 14% of all acute\\near infections).\\nThere are other factors which make the development\\nof an ear infection more likely.

Children also have alot of lymph tissue (commonly called the adenoids) inthe area of the eustachian tube. These adenoids mayenlarge with repeated respiratory tract infections (colds),ultimately blocking the eustachian tubes. When theeustachian tube is blocked, the middle ear is more likelyto fill with fluid. This fluid, then, increases the risk ofinfection, and the risk of hearing loss and delayed\\nspeech development.\\nMost cases of acute otitis media occur during the\\ncourse of a URI. Symptoms include fever , ear pain , and\\nproblems with hearing. Babies may have difficulty feed-ing. When significant fluid is present within the middleear, pain may increase depending on position. Lyingdown may cause an increase in painful pressure withinthe middle ear, so that babies may fuss if not heldupright. If the fluid build-up behind the eardrum is suffi-cient, the eardrum may develop a hole (perforate), caus-ing bloody fluid or greenish-yellow pus to drip from theear. Although pain may be significant leading up to sucha perforation, the pain is usually relieved by the reduc-\\ntion of pressure brought on by a perforation.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is usually made simply by looking at the\\neardrum through a special lighted instrument called anotoscope. The eardrum will appear red and swollen, andmay appear either abnormally drawn inward, or bulgingoutward. Under normal conditions, the ossicles create aparticular pattern on the eardrum, referred to as “land-marks.” These landmarks may be obscured. Normally, thelight from the otoscope reflects off of the eardrum in acharacteristic fashion. This is called the “cone of light.” Inan infection, this cone of light may be shifted or absent.\\nA special attachment to the otoscope allows a puff of\\nair to be blown lightly into the ear. Normally, this shouldcause movement of the eardrum. In an infection, or whenthere is fluid behind the eardrum, this movement may bedecreased or absent.\\nIf fluid or pus is draining from the ear, it can be col-\\nlected.

Different antibiotics are used depending on thetype of bacteria most likely to be causing the infection.This decision involves knowledge of the types of antibi-otics that have worked on other ear infections occurringwithin a particular community at a particular time.Options include sulfa-based antibiotics, as well as a vari-ety of penicillins and cephalosporins .\\nSome controversy exists regarding whether overuse of\\nantibiotics is actually contributing to the development ofbacteria, which may evolve and become able to avoid beingkilled by antibiotics. Research is being done to try to helpdetermine whether there may be some ear infections whichwould resolve without antibiotic treatment. In the mean-time, the classic treatment of an ear infection continues toinvolve a seven to 10 day course of antibiotic medication.\\nSome medical practitioners prescribe the use of spe-\\ncial nosedrops, decongestants , or antihistamines to\\nimprove the functioning of the eustachian tube.\\nIn a few rare cases, a procedure to drain the middle\\near of pus may be performed. This procedure is calledmyringotomy.\\nAlternative treatment\\nSome practitioners believe that food allergies may\\nincrease the risk of ear infections, and they suggest elimi-nating suspected food allergens from the diet. The top foodallergens are wheat, dairy products, corn, peanuts, citrusfruits, and eggs. Elimination of sugar and sugar productscan allow the immune system to work more effectively. Anumber of herbal treatments have been recommended,including ear drops made with goldenseal ( Hydrastis\\ncanadensis ), mullein ( Verbascum thapsus ),St. John’s\\nwort (Hypericum perforatum ), and echinacea (Echinacea\\nspp.). Among the herbs often recommended for oral treat-ment of otitis media are echinacea and cleavers ( Galium\\naparine ), or black cohosh ( Cimicifuga racemosa ) and gink-\\ngo (Ginkgo biloba ). Homeopathic remedies that may be\\nprescribed include aconite ( Acontium napellus ),Ferrum\\nphosphoricum, belladonna, chamomile, Lycopodium, pul-\\nsatilla ( Pulsatilla nigricans ), or silica.

Furthermore, without treatment,otitis media can lead to an infection within the nearbymastoid bone, called mastoiditis .\\nPrevention\\nAlthough otitis media seems somewhat inevitable in\\nchildhood, some measures can be taken to decrease thechance of repeated infections and fluid accumulation.Breastfeeding provides some protection against URIs,which in turn protects against the development of otitismedia. If a child is bottle-fed, parents should be advised tofeed him or her upright, rather than allowing the baby to liedown with the bottle. General good hygiene practices (espe-cially handwashing) help to decrease the number of upperrespiratory infections in a household or daycare center.\\nAfter a child has completed treatment for otitis media,\\na return visit to the practitioner should be scheduled. Thisvisit should occur after the antibiotic has been completed,and allows the practitioner to evaluate the patient for thepersistent presence of fluid within the middle ear. In chil-dren who have a problem with recurrent otitis media, asmall daily dose of an antibiotic may prevent repeated fullattacks of otitis media. In children who have persistentfluid, a procedure to place tiny tubes within the eardrummay help equalize pressure between the middle ear and theoutside, thus preventing further fluid accumulation.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nDuran, Marlene, et al. “Infections of the Upper Respiratory\\nTract.” In Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine ,e d .\\nAnthony S.

Sound waves passingthrough the ear cause the ear drum to vibrate. This vibra-tion is transmitted to the inner ear by the three bones. Inthe inner ear, the vibrations are changed into impulseswhich are carried by the nerves, to the brain. If excessivebone growth interferes with the stapes ability to vibrateand transmit sound waves, hearing loss will result.\\nOtosclerosis is classified as a conductive disorder\\nbecause it involves the bones of the ear, which conductthe sound to the nerve. If a person has hearing loss classi-fied as neural, the nerve conducting the impulses to thebrain is involved.\\nOtosclerosis is a common hereditary condition.

It is the most common cause of conductive hearing lossbetween the ages of 15–50, but if the bony growth affectsonly the hammer or anvil, there are no symptoms and thecondition goes undetected. Disease affecting the stapes isalso associated with progressive hearing loss.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nOtosclerosis is hereditary. Acquired illness and acci-\\ndents have no relationship to its development.\\nThe primary symptom of otosclerosis is loss of hear-\\ning. In addition, many people experience tinnitus (noice\\noriginating inside the ear). The amount of tinnitus is notnecessarily related to the kind or severity of hearing loss.\\nDiagnosis\\nHearing loss due to otosclerosis is usually first\\nnoticed in the late teens or early twenties. Hearing lossusually occurs in the low frequencies first, followed byhigh frequencies, then middle frequencies. Extensivehearing tests will confirm the diagnosis.\\nTreatment\\nPeople with otosclerosis often benefit from a proper-\\nly fitted hearing aid.\\nThe surgical replacement of the stapes has become a\\ncommon procedure to improve conductive hearing prob-lems. During this operation, called a stapedectomy , the\\nstapes is removed and replaced with an artificial device.The operation is performed under local anesthesia and isusually an outpatient procedure. Surgery is done on onlyone ear at a time, with a one year wait between procedures.The degree of hearing improvement reaches its maximumabout four months after the surgery.

This section of the ear contains both the hearingmechanism and the vestibulocochlear nerve, the nervethat sends hearing and balance information to the brain.Because of this, ototoxic drugs may cause lack of hear-ing, and loss of sense of balance.\\nThe extent of ototoxicity varies with the drug, the\\ndose, and other conditions. In some cases, there is fullrecovery after the drug has been discontinued. In othercases, the extent of damage is limited, and may even betoo small to be noticed. This may occur in high frequen-cy hearing loss , where the damage to the ear makes it\\ndifficult to hear high pitched musical notes, but does notaffect the ability to hear the spoken word, or carry on aconversation. In extreme cases, there may be permanentand complete deafness.\\nAlthough ototoxicity is undersirable, the ear damage\\ncan actually be used to help people with Meniere’s dis-\\nease. This is a disease of no known cause that is marked\\nby sudden episodes of dizziness and vertigo. Other\\nsymptoms include a feeling of “fullness” in the ears,roaring in the ears, and ringing in the ears. While mostpeople with this condition can be controlled with med-ication, about 10% require surgery. However, use ofsome ototoxic drugs can actually improve this condition,while causing less damage to the hearing mechanismthan traditional treatments.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMany drugs can cause ototoxicity.\\nAntibiotics\\n• amikacin (Amikin)\\n• streptomycin\\n• neomycin\\n• gentamicin (Garamycin)• erythromycin (E-Mycin, Eryc)• kanamycin (Kantrex• tobramycin (Nebcin)• netilmycin (Netromycin)• vancomycin (Vancocin)\\nAnti-cancer drugs\\n• cisplatin (Platinol AQ\\n• bleomycin (Blenoxane)• vincristine (Oncovin)\\nDiuretics\\n• acetazolamide (Diamox)\\n• furosemide (Lasix)• bumetanide (Bumex)• ethacrynic acid (Edecrine)\\nA number of other drugs and chemicals may also\\ncause ototoxicity.

This list is\\nnot complete, and many other drugs and chemicals, suchas industrial solvents, may cause ear problems.\\nDiagnosis\\nOtotoxicity often goes undiagnosed. This occurs when\\nthe hearing loss is slight, or when it is restricted to the high-er frequencies. Patients may notice a change in their hear-ing, but it may not be significant enough to report.\\nIn other cases, the loss of hearing may be very sig-\\nnificant, or the ototoxicity may take the form of ringingin the ears, or other sensations.\\nWhen physicians are administering medications that\\nare known to cause hearing loss, it is often recommendedthat the patient receive regular hearing tests. By monitor-ing hearing on a regular basis, it may be possible to dis-continue the medication, or reduce the dose so that nofurther damage is done.\\nOtotoxicity that causes loss of balance may be even\\nmore difficult to diagnose. These changes may take placegradually, over time, and may be confused with theeffects of the condition the drugs are meant to treat. Ifototoxicity is suspected, balance tests are available,including a platform balance test, and a rotary chair.These, and other tests, determine how a patient respondsto motion and changes in body position.\\nTreatment\\nThere are no current treatments to reverse the effects\\nof ototoxicity.\\nPeople who suffer permanent hearing loss may elect\\nto use hearing aids , or, when appropriate, receive a\\ncochlear implant. For those who have balance problems,physical therapy may often be helpful. Physical thera-pists can help people with balance problems learn to relymore on vision and the sensations from muscles toachieve balance.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis depends on the drugs that caused the\\nototoxicity, and their dose.\\nThe aminoglycoside antibiotics , gentamicin, kan-\\namycin, netilmycin and tobramycin all cause hearingloss to varying degrees. These drugs may be used to treatlife-threatening infections that are resistant to otherclasses of drugs, and so there may be no choice but to usethem. Careful dosing can minimize, but not eliminate therisk. It is estimated that the chances of recovery are 10-15%. The hearing loss usually begins at the higher fre-quencies, and is usually not recognized immediately.KEY TERMS\\nAntibiotic —Drugs that kill or inhibit the growth of\\nbacteria.\\nCochlea —A division of the inner ear.\\nDiuretic —A drug that increases water loss through\\nincreased urination.\\nMeniere’s disease —A disorder of the membranous\\nlabyrinth of the inner ear that is marked by recur-rent attacks of dizziness, tinnitus, and deafness—also called Ménière’s syndrome. It is named afterProsper Ménière(1799–1862), a French physicianwho was among the first people to study diseasesof the ear, nose, and throat.\\nTinnitus —Ringing sounds in the ears.\\nErythromycin may cause hearing loss that affects all\\nfrequencies. This hearing loss usually reverses itself overtime.\\nAspirin and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory\\ndrugs (NSAIDS) may cause ringing in the ears ( tinni-\\ntus). This stops when the drug is discontinued.\\nThe diuretics may cause a hearing loss with a rapid\\nonset. This will usually, but not always, reverse itselfwhen the drugs are stopped.\\nIn some cases, the prognosis isn’t really clear. Van-\\ncomycin appears to cause hearing loss, but this may onlyoccur when vancomycin is used at the same time as otherototoxic drugs, such as gentamicin or erythromycin.\\nPrevention\\nSince most ototoxicity occurs when the harmful\\ndrugs are used in high doses, careful dose calculationsare the best method of prevention.

Cancerous, or malignant, cells divideand multiply in an abnormal fashion.\\nDescription\\nThe ovaries are small, almond-shaped organs, locat-\\ned in the pelvic region, one on either side of the uterus.When a woman is in her childbearing years, the ovariesalternate to produce and release an egg each month dur-ing the menstrual cycle. The released egg is picked up bythe adjacent fallopian tube, and continues down towardthe uterus. The ovaries also produce and secrete thefemale hormones estrogen and progesterone, which regu-late the menstrual cycle and pregnancy , as well as sup-\\nport the development of the secondary female sexualcharacteristics (breasts, body shape, and body hair). Dur-ing pregnancy and when women take certain medica-tions, such as oral contraceptives , the ovaries are given\\na rest from their usual monthly duties.\\nTypes of ovarian cancers\\nNinety percent of all ovarian cancers develop in the\\ncells lining the surface, or epithelium, of the ovaries andso are called epithelial cell tumors. About 15% of epithe-lial cancers are considered low malignant potential orLMP tumors. These tumors occur more often in youngerwomen, and are more likely to be caught early, so prog-nosis is good.Germ cell tumors develop in the egg-producing cells\\nof the ovary, and comprise about 5% of ovarian tumors.These tumors are usually found in teenage girls or youngwomen. The prognosis is good if found early, but as withother ovarian cancers, early detection is difficult.\\nPrimary peritoneal carcinoma (PPC) is a cancer of\\nthe peritoneum, the lining of the abdominal cavity wherethe internal organs are located. Although it is a distinctdisease, it is linked with ovarian cancer. This is becausethe ovarian and peritoneal cells have the same embryonicorigin. This means that the very early cells of the embryothat will ultimately develop into the ovaries and the peri-toneum share a common origin. The term “primary”means that the cancer started first in the peritoneum, asopposed to the cancer starting in the ovary and then mov-ing, or metastasizing, into the peritoneum.\\nOvarian cancer can develop at any age, but is most\\nlikely to occur in women who are 50 years or older. Morethan half the cases are among women who are aged 65years and older. Industrialized countries have the highestincidence of ovarian cancer. Caucasian women, especiallyof Ashkenazi Jewish descent, are at somewhat higher risk;African-American and Asian women are at a slightly lowerrisk. The risk of developing the disease increases with age.Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cancer amongwomen in the United States, and the second most commongynecologic cancer. It accounts for 4% of all cancers inwomen. However, because of poor early detection, thedeath rate for ovarian cancer is higher than for that of any\\nother cancer among women. The American Cancer Societyestimates about 24,000 new cases of ovarian cancer in 2000in the United States, and about 14,000 deaths.\\nOnly 50% of the women who are diagnosed with\\novarian cancer will survive five years after initial diagno-sis. This is due to the cancer being at an advanced stageat the time of diagnosis. With early detection, however,survival at five years post diagnosis may be 95%.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe actual cause of ovarian cancer remains\\nunknown, but several factors are known to increase one’schances of developing the disease. These are called riskfactors. Women at a higher risk than average of develop-ing ovarian cancer include women who:\\n• have never been pregnant or had children,\\n• are Caucasian, especially of Northern European or\\nAskenazi Jewish descent,\\n• are over 50 (half of all diagnosed cases are in women\\nover 65),\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2439Ovarian cancer'),\n",

(The risk is greater if twoor more first-degree relatives had the disease. Having agrandmother, aunt or cousin with ovarian cancer alsoputs a woman at higher-than-average risk.)\\n• have the genetic mutation BRCA1 or BRCA2. (Not all\\nwomen with these genetic breast cancer mutations willdevelop ovarian cancer. By age 70, a woman who hasthe BRCA1 mutation carries about a 40–60% risk ofdeveloping ovarian cancer. Women with the geneticmutation BRCA2 have a 15% increased risk of devel-oping ovarian cancer. However, heredity only plays arole in about 5–10% of cases of ovarian cancer.)\\nWomen who have a strong familial history may ben-\\nefit from genetic counseling to better understand their\\nrisk factors.\\nIn addition to the above risk factors, the following\\nfactors appear to play a role in affecting a women’schances of developing ovarian cancer.\\nReproduction and hormones. Early menstruation\\n(before age 12) and late menopause seem to put women\\nat a higher risk for ovarian cancer. This appears to bebecause the longer, or more often, a woman ovulates, thehigher her risk for ovarian cancer. As mentioned above,women who were never pregnant have a higher risk ofdeveloping the disease than women with one or morepregnancies. It is not yet clear from research studieswhether a pregnancy that ends in miscarriage or still-\\nbirth lowers the risk factor to the same degree as the\\nnumber of term pregnancies. The use of post-menopausalestrogen supplementation for 10 years or more may dou-ble a woman’s risk of ovarian cancer. Short-term usedoes not seem to alter one’s risk factor.\\nInfertility drug-stimulated ovulation. Research\\nstudies have reported mixed findings on this issue. Itappears that women who take medications to stimulateovulation, yet do not become pregnant, are at higher riskof developing ovarian cancer. Women who do becomepregnant after taking fertility drugs do not appear to be athigher risk. One study reported that the use of the fertili-ty drug clomiphene citrate for more than a year increasedthe risk of developing LMP tumors. LMP tumorsrespond better to treatment than other ovarian tumors.\\nTalc. The use of talcum powder in the genital area\\nhas been implicated in ovarian cancer in many studies. Itmay be because talc contains particles of asbestos, aknown carcinogen. Female workers exposed to asbestoshad a higher-than-normal risk of developing ovarian can-cer. Genital deodorant sprays may also present an\\nincreased risk. Not all studies have brought consistentresults.\\nFat. A high-fat diet has been reported in some stud-\\nies to increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer. Inone study the risk level increased with every 10 grams ofsaturated fat added to the diet. This may be because of itseffect on estrogen production.\\nSymptoms\\nMost of the literature on ovarian cancer states that\\nthere are usually no early warning symptoms for the dis-ease. Ovarian cancer is often referred to as a silent killer,because women either are unaware of having it, or havesymptoms that are not accurately diagnosed until the dis-ease is in an advanced state. However, a November 2000study reported in the medical journal Cancer analyzed\\nmore than 1,700 questionnaires completed by womenwith stage III and stage IV ovarian cancer. Theresearchers found that 95% of the women reported hav-ing had early symptoms that they brought to their doc-tors. Most symptoms were somewhat vague and eitherabdominal or gastrointestinal in nature, and consequentlywere either not properly diagnosed or were recognized asbeing ovarian in nature only after a significant length oftime had passed.\\nThe following symptoms are warning signs of ovari-\\nan cancer, but could also be due to other causes. Symp-toms that persist for two to three weeks, or symptomsthat are unusual for the particular woman should be eval-uated by a doctor right away.\\n• digestive symptoms, such as gas, indigestion ,consti-\\npation , or a feeling of fullness after a light meal\\n• bloating, distention or cramping• abdominal or low-back discomfort\\n• pelvic pressure or frequent urination\\n• unexplained changes in bowel habits• nausea or vomiting\\n•pain or swelling in the abdomen\\n• loss of appetite•fatigue\\n• unexplained weight gain or loss\\n• pain during intercourse• vaginal bleeding in post-menopausal women\\nDiagnosis\\nIn the best-case scenario a woman is diagnosed with\\novarian cancer while it is still contained in just one ovary.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2440Ovarian cancer'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 147}, page_content='Early detection can bring five-year survival to near 95%.\\nUnfortunately, about 75% of women (3 out of 4) haveadvanced ovarian cancer at the time of diagnosis.(Advanced cancer is at stage III or stage IV when it hasalready spread to other organs.) Five-year survival forwomen with stage IV ovarian cancer may be less than 5%.\\nDiagnostic tests and techniques\\nIf ovarian cancer is suspected, several of the follow-\\ning tests and examinations will be necessary to make adiagnosis:\\n• a complete medical history to assess all the risk factors• a thorough bi-manual pelvic examination• CA-125 assay• one or more various imaging procedures\\n• a lower GI series, or barium enema\\n• diagnostic laparoscopy\\nBI-MANUAL PELVIC EXAMINATION. The exam should\\ninclude feeling the following organs for any abnormalitiesin shape or size: the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagi-na, bladder, and rectum. Because the ovaries are locateddeep within the pelvic area, it is unlikely that a manualexam will pick up an abnormality while the cancer is stilllocalized. However, a full examination provides the prac-titioner with a more complete picture. An enlarged ovarydoes not confirm cancer, as the ovary may be largebecause of a cyst or endometriosis . While women should\\nhave an annual Pap test , this test screens for cervical\\ncancer . Cancerous ovarian cells, however, might be\\ndetected on the slide. Effectiveness of using Pap smearsfor ovarian cancer detection is about 10-30%.\\nCA-125 ASSAY. This is a blood test to determine the\\nlevel of CA-125, a tumor marker. A tumor marker is ameasurable protein-based substance given off by thetumor. A series of CA-125 tests may be done to see if theamount of the marker in the blood is staying stable,increasing or decreasing. A rising CA-125 level usuallyindicates cancer, while a stable or declining value ismore characteristic of a cyst. The CA-125 level shouldnever be used alone to diagnose ovarian cancer. It is ele-vated in about 80% of women with ovarian cancer, but in20% of cases is not. In addition, it could be elevatedbecause of a non-ovarian cancer, or it can be elevatedwith non-malignant gynecologic conditions, such asendometriosis or ectopic pregnancy . During menstrua-\\ntion the CA-125 level may be elevated, so the test is bestdone when the woman is not in her menses.\\nIMAGING. There are several different imaging tech-\\nniques used in ovarian cancer evaluation. A fluid-filledstructure such as a cyst creates a different image thandoes a solid structure, such as a tumor. An ultrasound\\nuses high-frequency sound waves that create a visual pat-tern of echoes of the structures at which they are aimed.It is painless, and is the same technique used to check thedeveloping fetus in the womb. Ultrasound may be doneexternally through the abdomen and lower pelvic area, orwith a transvaginal probe.\\nOther painless imaging techniques are computed\\ntomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging\\n(MRI). Color Doppler analysis provides additional con-trast and accuracy in distinguishing masses. It remainsunclear whether Doppler is effective in reducing the highnumber of false-positives with transvaginal ultrasonogra-phy. These imaging techniques allow better visualizationof the internal organs and can detect abnormalities with-out having to perform surgery.\\nLOWER GI SERIES. A lower GI series, or barium\\nenema, uses a series of x rays to highlight the colon andrectum. To provide contrast, the patient drinks a chalkyliquid containing barium. This test might be done to seeif the cancer had spread to these areas.\\nDIAGNOSTIC LAPAROSCOPY. This technique uses a\\nthin, hollow, lighted instrument inserted through a smallincision in the skin near the belly button to visualize theorgans inside of the abdominal cavity. If the ovary isbelieved to be malignant, the entire ovary is removed(oophorectomy ) and its tissue sent for evaluation to the\\npathologist, even though only a small piece of the tissue isneeded for evaluation. If cancer is present, great care mustbe taken not to cause the rupture of the malignant tumor,as this would cause spreading of the cancer to adjacentorgans. If the cancer is completely contained in the ovary,its removal functions also as the treatment. If the cancerhas spread or is suspected to have spread, then a salinesolution may be instilled into the cavity and then drawnout again. This technique is called peritoneal lavage. Theaspirated fluid will be evaluated for the presence of cancercells. If peritoneal fluid is present, called ascites , a sample\\nof this will also be drawn and examined for malignantcells. If cancer cells are present in the peritoneum, thentreatment will be directed at the abdominal cavity as well.\\nTreatment\\nClinical staging\\nStaging is the term used to determine if the cancer is\\nlocalized or has spread, and if so, how far and to where.Staging helps define the cancer, and will determine thecourse of suggested treatment. Staging involves examin-ing any tissue samples that have been taken from theovary, nearby lymph nodes, as well as from any nearbyorgans or structures where metastasis was suspected.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2441Ovarian cancer'),\n",

Treatment plans are based on stag-ing, in part because of trying to duplicate the best resultsachieved in prior research trials. When staging is incon-sistent, it becomes more difficult to know how differentresearch studies compare, so the results themselves can-not be relied upon.\\nTreatment offered will primarily depend on the stage\\nof the cancer and the woman’s age. It is always appropri-ate to consider getting a second opinion, especially whentreatment involves surgery, chemotherapy , and possible\\nradiation. Before the patient makes her decision as towhich course of treatment to take, she should feel thatshe has the information necessary with which to make aninformed decision. The diagnostic tools mentioned aboveare used to determine the course of treatment. However,the treatment plan may need to be revised if the surgeonsees that the tumor has spread beyond the scope of whatwas seen during diagnostic tests.\\nSurgery\\nSurgery is done to remove as much of the tumor as\\npossible (called tissue debulking), utilizing chemothera-py and/or radiation to target cancer cells that haveremained in the body, without jeopardizing the woman’shealth. This can be hard to balance once the cancer hasspread. Removal of the ovary is called oophorectomy,and removal of both ovaries is called bi-lateral oophorec-tomy. Unless it is very clear that the cancer has notspread, the fallopian tubes are usually removed as well(salpingo-oophorectomy ). Removal of the uterus is\\ncalled hysterectomy .\\nIf the woman is very young, all attempts will be\\nmade to spare the uterus. It is crucial that a woman dis-cuss with her surgeon her childbearing plans prior to\\nsurgery. Unfortunately, ovarian cancer spreads easily andoften swiftly throughout the reproductive tract. It may benecessary to remove all reproductive organs as well aspart of the lining of the peritoneum to provide the womanwith the best possible chance of long-term survival. Fer-tility-sparing surgery can be successful if the ovariancancer is caught very early.\\nSide effects of the surgery will depend on the extent\\nof the surgery, but may include pain and temporary diffi-culty with bladder and bowel function, as well as reactionto the loss of hormones produced by the organs removed.A hormone replacement patch may be applied to thewoman’s skin in the recovery room to help with the tran-sition. An emotional side effect may be the feeling of lossstemming from the removal of reproductive organs.\\nChemotherapy\\nChemotherapy is used to target cells that have trav-\\neled to other organs, and throughout the body via thelymphatic system or the blood stream. Chemotherapydrugs are designed to kill cancer cells, but may also beharmful to healthy cells as well. Chemotherapy may beadministered through a vein in the arm (intravenous, IV),may be taken in tablet form, and/or may be given througha thin tube called a catheter directly into the abdominalcavity (intraperitoneal). IV and oral chemotherapy drugstravel throughout the body; intraperitoneal chemotherapyis localized in the abdominal cavity.\\nSide effects of chemotherapy can vary greatly\\ndepending on the drugs used. Currently, chemotherapydrugs are often used in combinations to treat advancedovarian cancer, and usually the combination includes aplatinum-based drug (such as cisplatin) with a taxolagent, such as paclitaxel. Some of the combinations usedor being studied include: carboplatin/paclitaxel, cis-platin/paclitaxel, cisplatin/topotecan, and cisplatin/car-boplatin. As new drugs are evaluated and developed, thegoal is always for maximum effectiveness with minimumside effects. Side effects include nausea and vomiting ,\\ndiarrhea , decreased appetite and resulting weight loss,\\nfatigue, headaches, loss of hair, and numbness and tin-\\ngling in the hands or feet. Managing these side effects is\\nan important part of cancer treatment.\\nAfter the full course of chemotherapy has been\\ngiven, the surgeon may perform a “second look” surgeryto examine the abdominal cavity again to evaluate thesuccess of treatment.\\nRadiation\\nRadiation uses high-energy, highly focused x rays to\\ntarget very specific areas of cancer.

Very careful\\nmeasurements are taken so that the targeted area can beas focused and small as possible. Another form of radia-tion uses a radioactive liquid that is administered into theabdominal cavity in the same fashion as intraperitonealchemotherapy. Radiation is usually given on a dailyMonday though Friday schedule and for several weekscontinuously. Radiation is not painful, but side effectscan include skin damage at the area exposed to the exter-nal beam, and extreme fatigue. The fatigue may hit sud-denly in the third week or so of treatment, and may take awhile to recover even after treatments have terminated.Other side effects may include nausea, vomiting, diar-rhea, loss of appetite, weight loss and urinary difficulties.For patients with incurable ovarian cancer, radiation maybe used to shrink tumor masses to provide pain relief andimprove quality of life.\\nOnce the full course of treatment has been undertak-\\nen, it is important to have regular follow-up care to moni-tor for any long-term side effects as well as for futurerelapse or metastases.\\nAlternative treatment\\nThe term alternative therapy refers to therapy uti-\\nlized instead of conventional treatment. By definition,these treatments have not been scientifically proven orinvestigated as thoroughly and by the same standards asconventional treatments. The terms complementary orintegrative therapies denote practices used in conjunc-tion with conventional treatment. Regardless of the\\ntherapies chosen, it is key for patients to inform theirdoctors of any alternative or complementary therapiesbeing used or considered. (Some alternative and com-plementary therapies adversely affect the effectivenessof conventional treatments.) Some common comple-mentary and alternative medicine techniques and thera-pies include:\\n• prayer and faith healing•meditation\\n• mind/body techniques such as support groups, visual-\\nization, guided imagery and hypnosis\\n• energy work such as therapeutic touch and Reiki\\n•acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine\\n• body work such as yoga , massage and T’ai Chi\\n• vitamins and herbal supplements• diets such as vegetarianism and macrobiotic\\nMind/body techniques along with meditation,\\nprayer, yoga, T’ai Chi and acupuncture have been shownto reduce stress levels, and the relaxation provided may\\nhelp boost the body’s immune system.

While stage Icancer may have a 95% success rate, stages III and IVmay have a survival rate of 17-30% at five years post-diagnosis. Early detection remains an elusive, yethopeful, goal of research. Also, clinical trials areaddressing new drug and treatment combinations toprolong survival in women with more advanced dis-ease. Learning one’s family history may assist in earlydetection, and genetic studies may clarify who is atgreater risk for the disease.\\nResearch studies are usually designed to compare a\\nnew treatment method against the standard method, orthe effectiveness of a drug against a placebo (an inertsubstance that would be expected to have no effect onthe outcome). Since the research is experimental innature, there are no guarantees about the outcome. Newdrugs being used may have harmful, unknown sideeffects. Some people participate to help further knowl-edge about their disease. For others, the study may pro-vide a possible treatment that is not yet available other-wise. If one participates in a study and is in the groupreceiving the standard care or the placebo, and the treat-ment group gets clear benefit, it may be possible toreceive the experimental treatment once one’s originalparticipation role is over. Participants will have to meetcertain criteria before being admitted into the study. It isimportant to fully understand one’s role in the study, andweigh the potential risks versus benefits when decidingwhether or not to participate.\\nPrevention\\nSince the cause of ovarian cancer is not known, it is\\nnot possible to fully prevent the disease. However, thereare ways to reduce one’s risks of developing the disease.\\nDecrease ovulation. Pregnancy gives a break from\\novulation, and multiple pregnancies appear to furtherreduce the risk of ovarian cancer. The research is notclear as to whether the pregnancy must result in a termdelivery to have full benefit. Women who breast-feedtheir children also have a lower risk of developing thedisease. Since oral contraceptives suppress ovulation,women who take birth control pills (BCPs), even for aslittle as 3 to 6 months have a lower incidence of the dis-ease. It appears that the longer a woman takes BCPs, thelower her risk for ovarian cancer. Also, this benefit maylast for up to 15 years after a woman has stopped takingthem. However, since BCPs alter a woman’s hormonalstatus, her risk for other hormonally related cancers maychange. For this reason it is very important to discuss allthe risks and benefits with one’s health care provider.Genetic testing . Tests are available which can help\\nto determine whether a woman who has a family historyof breast, endometrial, or ovarian cancer has inheritedthe mutated BRCA gene that predisposes her to thesecancers. If the woman tests positive for the mutation,then she may be able to choose to have her ovariesremoved. Even without testing for the mutated gene,some women with strong family histories of ovarian can-cer may consider having their ovaries removed as a pre-ventative measure (prophylactic oophorectomy). Thisprocedure diminishes but does not completely removethe risk of cancer, as some women may still develop pri-mary peritoneal carcinoma after oophorectomy.\\nSurgery. Procedures such as tubal ligation (in\\nwhich the fallopian tubes are blocked or cut off) and hys-terectomy (in which the uterus is removed) appear toreduce the risk of ovarian cancer. However, any removalof the reproductive tract organs has surgical as well ashormonal side effects.\\nScreening. There are no definitive tests or screen-\\ning procedures to detect ovarian cancer in its earlystages. Women at high risk should consult with theirphysicians about regular screenings, which may includetransvaginal ultrasound and the blood test for the CA-125 protein.\\nThe American Cancer Society recommends annual\\npelvic examinations for all women after age 40, in order toincrease the chances of early detection of ovarian cancer.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nColeman, C.

Lymph is a fluid that contains the infection-fighting white blood cells that form part of thebody’s immune system. Because the network goesthroughout the body, cancer cells that enter thelymphatic system can travel to and be deposited atany point into the tissues and organs and formnew tumors there.\\nPathologist —The pathologist is a doctor specializ-\\ning in determining the presence and type of dis-ease by looking at cells and tissue samples.\\nDescription\\nOvarian cysts are common and the vast majority are\\nharmless. Because they cause symptoms that may be thesame as ovarian tumors that may be cancerous, ovariancysts should always be checked out. The most commontypes of ovarian cysts are follicular and corpus luteum,which are related to the menstrual cycle. Follicular cystsoccur when the cyst-like follicle on the ovary in which theegg develops does not burst and release the egg. They areusually small and harmless, disappearing within two tothree menstrual cycles. Corpus luteum cysts occur whenthe corpus luteum—a small, yellow body that secretes hor-mones—doesn’t dissolve after the egg is released. Theyusually disappear in a few weeks but can grow to morethan 4 in (10 cm) in diameter and may twist the ovary.\\nOvarian cysts can develop any time from puberty to\\nmenopause , including during pregnancy . Follicular cysts\\noccur frequently during the years when a woman is men-struating, and are non-existent in postmenopausal womenor any woman who is not ovulating. Corpus luteum cystsoccur occasionally during the menstrual years and duringearly pregnancy. (Dermoid cysts, which may contain hair,teeth, or skin derived from the outer layer of cells of anembryo, are also occasionally found in the ovary.)\\nCauses and symptoms\\nFollicular cysts are caused by the formation of too\\nmuch fluid around a developing egg. Corpus luteumcysts are caused by excessive accumulation of blood dur-ing the menstrual cycle, hormone therapy, or other typesof ovarian tumors.\\nMany ovarian cysts have no symptoms. When the\\ngrowth is large or there are multiple cysts, the patientmay experience any of the following symptoms:\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2445Ovarian cysts\\nAn ovarian cyst is being surgically removed from a 25-year-\\nold female patient.

Symptomatic ovarian cysts are diagnosed through\\na pelvic exam and ultrasound. Ultrasonography is a pain-less test that uses a hand-held wand to send and receivesound waves to create images of the ovaries on a comput-er screen. The images are photographed for later analy-sis. It takes about 15 minutes and is usually done in ahospital or a physician’s office.\\nTreatment\\nMany follicular and corpus luteum cysts require no\\ntreatment and disappear on their own. Often the physi-cian will wait and re-examine the patient in four to sixweeks before taking any action. Follicular cysts don’trequire treatment, but birth control pills may be taken ifthe cysts interfere with the patient’s daily activities.\\nSurgery is usually indicated for patients who haven’t\\nreached puberty and have an ovarian mass and in post-menopausal patients. Surgery is also indicated if the\\ngrowth is larger than 4 in (10 cm), complex, growing,persistent, solid and irregularly shaped, on both ovaries,or causes pain or other symptoms. Ovarian cysts are cur-able with surgery but often recur without it.\\nSurgical options include removal of the cyst or\\nremoval of one or both ovaries. More than 90% of benignovarian cysts can be removed using laparoscopy , a mini-\\nmally invasive outpatient procedure. In laparoscopic cys-\\ntectomy , the patient receives a general or local anesthetic,\\nthen a small incision is made in the abdomen. The laparo-scope is inserted into the incision and the cyst or the entireovary is removed. Laparoscopic cystectomy enables thepatient to return to normal activities within two weeks.Surgical cystectomy to remove cysts and/or ovaries is per-formed under general anesthesia in a hospital and requiresa stay of five to seven days. After an incision is made in theabdomen, the muscles are separated and the membranesurrounding the abdominal cavity (peritoneum) is opened.Blood vessels to the ovaries are clamped and tied. The cystis located and removed. The peritoneum is closed, and theabdominal muscles and skin are closed with sutures orclips.

This resultsin extreme lower abdominal pain .\\nDescription\\nOvarian torsion occurs infrequently only in females.\\nIn can occur in women of all ages, but most women thatexperience this are younger. Approximately 70-75% ofcases occur in women under 30 years old. About 20% ofall reported cases are in pregnant women. It is the fifthmost common gynecological emergency which caninclude surgical intervention.\\nOvarian torsion usually arises in only one ovary at a\\ntime. They can occur in either normal or enlarged ovariesand fallopian tubes, and occasionally they develop in both.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are a variety of conditions that can cause tor-\\nsion of the ovary ranging from changes in normal ovaries\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2447Ovarian torsion'),\n",

Normal ovaries thatexperience spasms or changes in the blood vessels in themesosalpinx can become twisted. For example, if theveins in the mesosolpinx become congested, the ovarieswill undergo torsion.\\nDevelopmental abnormalities of the fallopian tube\\nsuch as extremely longer-than-normal tubes or a missingmesosalpinx will cause ovarian torsion. Diseases such asovarian cysts or fibromas, tumor of the ovary or tubes,\\nand trauma to either the ovaries or the tubes will alsocause ovarian torsion.\\nThe characteristic symptom of ovarian torsion is the\\nsudden onset of extreme lower abdominal pain that radi-ates to the back, side and thigh. Nausea, vomiting, diar-\\nrhea , and constipation can accompany the pain. The\\npatient may also experience tenderness in the lowerabdominal area, a mild fever and tachycardia.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of ovarian torsions usually occurs in\\nan emergency room due to the suddenness of extremepain. Emergency room physicians may consult withanother physician specializing in obstetrics and gynecol-ogy. Since 20% of ovarian torsions occur in pregnantwomen, physicians will order a pregnancy test. Visual-\\nization with an ultrasound and CT scan (computedtomography) will help pinpoint the ovarian structuresand allow physicians to diagnose.

This can result in digestive problems, behavioralchanges, brain damage, seizures, or coma . An adult\\nwhose heart, kidneys, and pituitary gland are functioningproperly would have to drink more than two gallons ofwater a day to develop water intoxication. This conditionis most common in patients whose kidney function isimpaired and may occur when doctors, nurses, or otherhealthcare professionals administer greater amounts ofwater-producing fluids and medications than thepatient’s body can excrete. Overhydration is the mostcommon electrolyte imbalance in hospitals, occurring inabout 2% of all patients.\\nInfants seem to be at greater risk for developing\\noverhydration.

Breast milkor formula provide all the fluids a healthy baby needs.Water should be given slowly, sparingly, and only duringextremely hot weather. Overhydration, which has beencited as a hazard of infant swimming lessons, occurswhenever a baby drinks too much water, excretes too lit-tle fluid, or consumes and retains too much water.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nDrinking too much water rarely causes overhydra-\\ntion when the body’s systems are working normally. Peo-ple with heart, kidney, or liver disease are more likely todevelop overhydration because their kidneys are unableto excrete water normally. It may be necessary for peoplewith these disorders to restrict the amount of water theydrink and/or adjust the amount of salt in their diets .\\nSince the brain is the organ most susceptible to over-\\nhydration, a change in behavior is usually the first symp-tom of water intoxication. The patient may become con-fused, drowsy, or inattentive. Shouting and delirium are\\ncommon. Other symptoms of overhydration may includeblurred vision, muscle cramps and twitching, paralysis\\non one side of the body, poor coordination, nausea and\\nvomiting , rapid breathing, sudden weight gain, and\\nweakness. The patient’s complexion is normal orflushed. Blood pressure is sometimes higher than nor-mal, but elevations may not be noticed even when thedegree of water intoxication is serious.\\nOverhydration can cause acidosis (a condition in\\nwhich blood and body tissues have an abnormally highacid content), anemia, cyanosis (a condition that occurs\\nwhen oxygen levels in the blood drop sharply), hemor-rhage, and shock . The brain is the organ most vulnerable\\nto the effects of overhydration. If excess fluid levelsaccumulate gradually, the brain may be able to adapt tothem and the patient will have only a few symptoms. Ifthe condition develops rapidly, confusion, seizures, andcoma are likely to occur.\\nRisk factors\\nChronic illness, malnutrition , a tendency to retain\\nwater, and kidney diseases and disorders increase thelikelihood of becoming overhydrated. Infants and theelderly seem to be at increased risk for overhydration, asare people with certain mental disorders or alcoholism .\\nDiagnosis\\nBefore treatment can begin, a doctor must determine\\nwhether a patient’s symptoms are due to overhydration, inwhich excess water is found within and outside cells, or\\nexcess blood volume, in which high sodium levels pre-vent the body from storing excess water inside the cells.Overhydration is characterized by excess water both with-in and around the body’s cells, while excess blood volumeoccurs when the body has too much sodium and can’tmove water to reservoirs within the cells. In cases of over-hydration, symptoms of fluid accumulation don’t usuallyoccur. On the other hand, in cases of excess blood vol-ume, fluid tends to accumulate around cells in the lowerlegs, abdomen, and chest. Overhydration can occur aloneor in conjunction with excess blood volume, and differen-tiating between these two conditions may be difficult.\\nTreatment\\nMild overhydration can generally be corrected by fol-\\nlowing a doctor’s instructions to limit fluid intake. In moreserious cases, diuretics may be prescribed to increase uri-\\nnation, although these drugs tend to be most effective inthe treatment of excess blood volume. Identifying andtreating any underlying condition (such as impaired heartor kidney function) is a priority, and fluid restrictions are acritical component of every treatment plan.\\nIn patients with severe neurologic symptoms, fluid\\nimbalances must be corrected without delay. A powerfuldiuretic and fluids to restore normal sodium concentra-tions are administered rapidly at first. When the patienthas absorbed 50% of the therapeutic substances, bloodlevels are measured. Therapy is continued at a moremoderate pace in order to prevent brain damage as aresult of sudden changes in blood chemistry.\\nPrognosis\\nMild water intoxication is usually corrected by\\ndrinking less than a quart of water a day for several days.Untreated water intoxication can be fatal, but this out-come is quite rare.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nGillenwater, Jay Y ., ed., et al.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 156}, page_content='Oxygen/ozone therapy\\nDefinition\\nOxygen/ozone therapy is a term that describes a\\nnumber of different practices in which oxygen, ozone, orhydrogen peroxide are administered via gas or water tokill disease microorganisms, improve cellular function,and promote the healing of damaged tissues. The ratio-nale behind bio-oxidative therapies, as they are some-times known, is the notion that as long as the body’sneeds for antioxidants are met, the use of certain oxida-tive substances will stimulate the movement of oxygenatoms from the bloodstream to the cells. With higher lev-els of oxygen in the tissues, bacteria and viruses arekilled along with defective tissue cells. The healthy cellssurvive and multiply more rapidly. The result is astronger immune system.\\nOzone itself is a form of oxygen, O\\n3, produced when\\nultraviolet light or an electric spark passes through air oroxygen. It is a toxic gas that creates free radicals, theopposite of what antioxidant vitamins do. Oxidation,\\nhowever, is good when it occurs in harmful foreignorganisms that have invaded the body. Ozone inactivatesmany disease bacteria and viruses.\\nPurpose\\nOxygen and ozone therapies are thought to benefit\\npatients in the following ways:\\n• stimulating white blood cell production\\n• killing viruses (ozone and hydrogen peroxide)• improving the delivery of oxygen from the blood\\nstream to the tissues of the body\\n• speeding up the breakdown of petrochemicals\\n• increasing the production of interferon and tumor\\nnecrosis factor, thus helping the body to fight infectionsand cancers\\n• increasing the efficiency of antioxidant enzymes• increasing the flexibility and efficiency of the mem-\\nbranes of red blood cells\\n• speeding up the citric acid cycle, which in turn stimu-\\nlates the body’s basic metabolism\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nThe various forms of oxygen and ozone therapy\\nhave been in use since the late nineteenth century. Theearliest recorded use of oxygen to treat a patient was byDr. J. A. Fontaine in 1879. In the 1950s, hyperbaric oxy-gen treatment was used by cancer researchers. The term\\nhyperbaric means that the oxygen is given under pressurehigher than normal air pressure. Recently, oxygen thera-py has also been touted as a quick purification treatmentfor mass-market consumers. Oxygen bars can be foundin airports and large cities, and provide pure oxygen in20-minute sessions for approximately $16. While propo-nents claim that breathing oxygen will purify the body,most medical doctors do not agree. What is more, oxy-gen can be harmful to people with severe lung diseases,and these people should never self-treat with oxygen.\\nOzone has been used since 1856 to disinfect operat-\\ning rooms in European hospitals, and since 1860 to puri-fy the water supplies of several large German cities.Ozone was not, however, used to treat patients until1915, when a German doctor named Albert Wolff beganto use it to treat skin diseases. During World War I, theGerman Army used ozone to treat wounds and anaero-\\nbic infections . In the 1950s, several German physicians\\nused ozone to treat cancer alongside mainstream thera-peutic methods. It is estimated that as of the late 1990s,about 8,000 practitioners in Germany were using ozonein their practices. This figure includes medical doctors aswell as naturopaths and homeopaths.\\nHydrogen peroxide is familiar to most people as an\\nover-the-counter preparation that is easily available atsupermarkets as well as pharmacies, and is used as anantiseptic for cleansing minor cuts and scrapes. It wasfirst used as an intravenous infusion in 1920 by a Britishphysician in India, T. H. Oliver, to treat a group of 25Indian patients who were critically ill with pneumonia .\\nOliver’s patients had a mortality rate of 48%, comparedto the standard mortality rate of 80% for the disease. Inthe 1920s, an American physician named William Kochexperimented with hydrogen peroxide as a treatment forcancer. He left the United States after a legal battle withthe FDA. In the early 1960s, researchers at Baylor Uni-versity studied the effects of hydrogen peroxide inremoving plaque from the arteries as well as its useful-ness in treating cancer, but their findings were largelyignored.\\nOxygen, ozone, and hydrogen peroxide are used\\ntherapeutically in a variety of different ways.\\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO)\\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) involves putting\\nthe patient in a pressurized chamber in which he or shebreathes pure oxygen for a period of 90 minutes to twohours. HBO may also be administered by using a tight-fitting mask, similar to the masks used for anesthesia. Anasal catheter may be used for small children.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2450Oxygen/ozone therapy'),\n",

They are most fre-quently prescribed to speed the heartbeat of patients whohave a heart rate well under 60 beats per minute (severesymptomatic bradycardia). They are also used in somecases to slow a fast heart rate (tachycardia).\\nPrecautions\\nThe symptoms of fatigue and lightheadedness that\\nare characteristic of bradycardia can also be caused by anumber of other medical conditions, including anemia.Certain prescription medications can also slow the heartrate. A doctor should take a complete medical historyand perform a full physical work-up to rule out all non-cardiac causes of bradycardia.\\nPatients with cardiac pacemakers should not under-\\ngo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedure.\\nDevices that emit electromagnetic waves (includingmagnets) may alter pacemaker programming or function-ing. A 1997 study found that cellular phones often inter-fere with pacemaker programming and cause irregularheart rhythm. However, advances in pacemaker designand materials have greatly reduced the risk of pacemakerinterference from electromagnetic fields.Description\\nApproximately 500,000 Americans have an\\nimplantable permanent pacemaker device. A pacemakerimplantation is performed under local anesthesia in a hos-pital by a surgeon assisted by a cardiologist. An insulatedwire called a lead is inserted into an incision above thecollarbone and guided through a large vein into the cham-bers of the heart. Depending on the configuration of thepacemaker and the clinical needs of the patient, as manyas three leads may be used in a pacing system. Currentpacemakers have a double, or bipolar, electrode attachedto the end of each lead. The electrodes deliver an electri-cal charge to the heart to regulate heartbeat. They arepositioned on the areas of the heart that require stimula-tion. The leads are then attached to the pacemaker device,which is implanted under the skin of the patient’s chest.\\nPatients undergoing surgical pacemaker implanta-\\ntion usually stay in the hospital overnight. Once the pro-cedure is complete, the patient’s vital signs are moni-tored and a chest x ray is taken to ensure that the pace-\\nmaker and leads are properly positioned.\\nModern pacemakers have sophisticated program-\\nming capabilities and are extremely compact. The small-est weigh less than 13 grams (under half an ounce) andare the size of two stacked silver dollars. The actual pac-ing device contains a pulse generator, circuitry pro-grammed to monitor heart rate and deliver stimulation,and a lithiumiodide battery. Battery life typically rangesfrom seven to 15 years, depending on the number of leadsthe pacemaker is configured with and how much energythe pacemaker uses. When a new battery is required, theunit can be exchanged in a simple outpatient procedure.\\nA temporary pacing system is sometimes recom-\\nmended for patients who are experiencing irregularheartbeats as a result of a recent heart attack or other\\nacute medical condition. The implantation procedure forthe pacemaker leads is similar to that for a permanentpacing system, but the actual pacemaker unit housing thepulse generator remains outside the patient’s body.

Paget’sdisease can affect one or more bones in the body. Mostoften, the pelvis, bones in the skull, the long bones (thelarge bones that make up the arms and legs), and the col-larbones are affected by Paget’s disease. In addition, thejoints between bones (the knees or elbows, for example)can develop arthritis because of this condition.\\nPaget’s disease is characterized by changes in the nor-\\nmal mechanism of bone formation. Bone is a living materi-al made by the body through the continual processes of for-mation and breakdown (resorption). The combination ofthese two actions is called remodeling and is used by thebody to build bone tissue that is strong and healthy. Strongbones are formed when bone tissue is made up of plate-shaped crystals of minerals called hydroxyapatite. Normal\\nwear and tear on the skeletal system is repaired throughoutlife by the ongoing process of remodeling. In fact, theentire human skeleton is remodeled every five years.\\nHealthy bone tissue has an ordered structure that\\ngives the bone its strength. Bones affected by Paget’s dis-ease, however, have a structure that is disorganized. Thisdisorganized structure weakens the diseased bone andmakes people suffering from this disease more likely tohave fractures . These fractures are slow to heal.\\nPaget’s disease of bone is most commonly found in\\nEurope, England, Australia, New Zealand, and NorthAmerica. In these areas, up to 3% of all people over 55years of age are affected with the disease. It is interestingto note that Paget’s disease is rare in Asia, possibly show-ing that this disease may affect some ethnic groups andgeographic areas more than others.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of Paget’s disease is not known. Various\\nviruses have been suggested to be involved in this dis-ease, but the relationship between viral infections andPaget’s disease remains uncertain. There also may to be agenetic component to this disease since it may appear inmore than one person within the same family.\\nPaget’s disease usually begins without any symp-\\ntoms. And, in its early stages, the symptoms that dooccur are often confused with symptoms of arthritis.However, as the disease progresses, bone and joint pain\\ndevelop. A unique feature of Paget’s disease is theenlargement of areas of affected bone. This type ofenlargement is clearly identifiable on an x ray.\\nIf the bones of the skull are affected by Paget’s dis-\\nease, enlargement of the skull can occur and may resultin a loss of hearing. When the long bones in the legs areaffected, they can become bent under the body’s weightbecause of their weakness. Little or no injury to a bonecan cause fractures in the weakened bones. Fractures thatoccur when no traumatic injury is present are known asspontaneous fractures.\\nAlthough rare, bone cancer occurs in less than 1%\\nof patients with Paget’s disease. Such cancer is oftenaccompanied by an abrupt increase in the intensity ofpain at the diseased site. Unfortunately, this type of can-cer has a poor prognosis; the average survival time fromthe onset of symptoms is generally one to three years.\\nDiagnosis\\nPaget’s disease is often found when an individual is\\nhaving x rays taken for medical reasons unrelated to thisbone disease. A diagnosis of Paget’s disease can also bemade when higher than normal levels of a chemicalcalled alkaline phosphatase are found in the blood. Alka-line phosphatase is a substance involved in the bone for-mation process, so if its levels are abnormally high thisindicates that the balance between bone formation andresorption is upset.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2455Paget’s disease of bone'),\n",

While non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugscan reduce bone pain, two additional categories of drugsare used to treat this disease.\\nHORMONE TREATMENT. Calcitonin, a hormone\\nwhich is made naturally by the thyroid gland, is used totreat Paget’s disease. This chemical rapidly decreases theamount of bone breakdown or loss (resorption). Afterapproximately two to three weeks of treatment with extracalcitonin, bone pain lessens and new bone tissue forms.Calcitonin is commonly given as daily injections for onemonth, followed by three injections each week for sever-al additional months. The total dose of calcitonin given\\nto an individual depends upon the amount of disease pre-sent and how well the individual’s condition responds tothe treatment.\\nAlthough calcitonin is effective in slowing the pro-\\ngression of Paget’s disease, the favorable effects of thedrug do not continue for very long once administration ofthe drug is stopped. In addition, some temporary sideeffects can occur with this drug. Nausea and flushing arethe most common side effects and have been found in 20-30% of individuals taking calcitonin. V omiting, diar-\\nrhea , and abdominal pain can also occur, but these\\neffects are also temporary. A form of calcitonin takennasally causes fewer side effects, but requires higherdoses because less of the drug reaches the diseased bone.\\nBISPHOSPHONATES. The bisphosphonate group of\\ndrugs are drugs that bind directly to bone mineralsbecause of their specific chemical structure. Once boundto the bone, these drugs inhibit bone loss by reducing theaction of bone cells that normally degrade bone duringthe remodeling process. Unlike treatment with calcitonin,the positive effects of increased bone formation andreduced pain can continue for many months or even yearsafter bisphosphonate treatment is stopped. Bisphospho-nates are considered the treatment of choice for Paget’sdisease and are usually given for 3-6 months at a time.\\nBisphosphonate drugs suitable for the treatment of\\nPaget’s disease are alendronate, clodronate, etidronate,pamidronate, risedronate, and tiludronate. The main sideeffects of these drugs include a flu-like reaction(pamidronate), gastrointestinal disturbances (alen-dronate, clodronate), and abnormal bone formation(etidronate, when taken in high doses). Risedronate is thenewest of these drugs. It is about 1,000 times morepotent than etidronate and 3 to 5 times more potent thanalendronate. Because of the greater potency of this drug,lower doses and a shorter duration of treatment arerequired. This leads to fewer side effects with similar, orbetter, clinical results in the patient.\\nSurgery\\nTreatment of Paget’s disease usually begins with\\ndrug therapy. However, various surgical treatments canalso be used to treat skeletal conditions that occur inpatients with Paget’s disease.\\nIn patients with severe arthritis of the hip or knee, a\\njoint replacement operation can be beneficial. However,\\nin addition to the malformation of bone tissue caused bythis condition, there are greater numbers of blood vesselsthat form in the diseased bone relative to a healthy bone.This makes surgery on bones affected with Paget’s dis-ease more difficult.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2456Paget’s disease of bone\\nThis woman’s legs are bowed due to Paget’s disease.

While sharing its name with Paget’s\\ndisease of bone , these are two medically unrelated con-\\nditions. They are simply named after the same doctorwho first described them.\\nDescription\\nPaget’s disease of the breast is generally associated\\nwith an underlying breast cancer . It is generally seen in\\npeople between the ages of 40 and 80 years. Cases inmen have been identified, but they are extremely rare.\\nPaget’s disease of the breast may also be called\\nmammary Paget’s disease (MPD). There is a much rarerform of this disease called extramammary Paget’s dis-ease (EMPD). MPD affects the breast nipple and is alsocalled Paget’s disease of the nipple. EMPD can affectthe skin of the external genital tissues in both womenand men, as well as the skin of the eyelids and externalear canal. MPD is believed to develop from a tumorgrowth within the milk ducts of the breast. EMPD mayrepresent a spreading (metastasis) of MPD to otherparts of the body.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of Paget’s disease of the breast is\\nunknown, but it is usually associated with an underlyingcancer of the breast.\\nThe symptoms of Paget’s disease of the breast include:\\n• red scaly patches of skin on the nipple and sometimes\\nalso on the dark area of skin around the nipple (areola)\\n• crusting, bleeding, or ulceration of the skin of the affect-\\ned area\\n• a discharge of fluid from the nipple\\n• a turning inward (inversion) of the nipple\\nIn approximately 30–40% of cases of Paget’s dis-\\nease of the breast, there is also a detectable lump in thebreast.\\nDiagnosis\\nPaget’s disease of the breast is often confused with\\nother skin conditions, such as eczema, dermatitis ,o r\\npsoriasis .

These creams willhave no effect on the skin conditions caused by Paget’sdisease of the breast.\\nTreatment\\nSurgery is the main treatment for Paget’s disease\\nof the breast. Removal of the breast ( mastectomy ) may\\nbe recommended if the cancer is seen in a wide areaaway from the nipple or appears to be deep into thebreast tissue. Breast conservation surgery, aimed atkeeping as much of the breast as possible, may be rec-ommended in cases where the disease is diagnosedearly enough and the cancer has not spread far from thesurface of the nipple.\\nSome people will require further treatment after\\nsurgery. This treatment may include radiation therapy ,\\nchemotherapy , or a combination of both. Radiation\\ntherapy involves using high-energy x rays to destroy anycancer cells that may remain after surgical removal of theprimary tumor. Radiation therapy is most common afterbreast conservation surgery. Chemotherapy involves theuse of medicinal drugs to destroy the growth of any can-cer cells that may remain after removal of the primarycancer. Chemotherapy treatments are most common aftermastectomy.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments for Paget’s disease of the\\nbreast include: the use of cartilage from cows or sharks; adiet known as Gerson therapy; administration of thechemicals hydrazine sulfate or laetrile; and, the injectionof solutions derived from the mistletoe plant.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for Paget’s disease of the breast\\ndepends on the underlying cancer that is causing thiscondition and whether or not this cancer has spread(metastasized) to other parts of the body.\\nPrevention\\nBecause the cause of Paget’s disease of the breast\\nis not known, prevention of this disease is not possible.KEY TERMS\\nMetastasis —The spread of a cancer from one part\\nof the body (where the cancer originated) toanother part of the body.\\nUlceration —The formation of an ulcer, a patch of\\ntissue that is discontinuous with the surroundingtissue because the tissue within the ulcer hasdecayed or died and been swept away.\\nIn instances where this conditions arises from other\\nunderlying cancers of the breast, it may be possible toprevent Paget’s disease of the breast from occurring ifthe underlying cause is diagnosed and successfullytreated prior to the development of Paget’s disease ofthe breast.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nLove, Susan M., and Karen Lindsey.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 165}, page_content='Pain\\nDefinition\\nPain is an unpleasant feeling that is conveyed to the\\nbrain by sensory neurons. The discomfort signals actualor potential injury to the body. However, pain is morethan a sensation, or the physical awareness of pain; it alsoincludes perception, the subjective interpretation of thediscomfort. Perception gives information on the pain’slocation, intensity, and something about its nature. Thevarious conscious and unconscious responses to both sen-sation and perception, including the emotional response,add further definition to the overall concept of pain.\\nDescription\\nPain arises from any number of situations. Injury is a\\nmajor cause, but pain may also arise from an illness. Itmay accompany a psychological condition, such asdepression, or may even occur in the absence of a recog-nizable trigger.\\nAcute pain\\nAcute pain often results from tissue damage, such as\\na skin burn or broken bone. Acute pain can also be asso-ciated with headaches or muscle cramps. This type ofpain usually goes away as the injury heals or the cause ofthe pain (stimulus) is removed.\\nTo understand acute pain, it is necessary to under-\\nstand the nerves that support it. Nerve cells, or neurons,perform many functions in the body. Although their gen-eral purpose, providing an interface between the brainand the body, remains constant, their capabilities varywidely. Certain types of neurons are capable of transmit-ting a pain signal to the brain.\\nAs a group, these pain-sensing neurons are called\\nnociceptors, and virtually every surface and organ of thebody is wired with them. The central part of these cells islocated in the spine, and they send threadlike projectionsto every part of the body. Nociceptors are classifiedaccording to the stimulus that prompts them to transmit apain signal. Thermoreceptive nociceptors are stimulatedby temperatures that are potentially tissue damaging.Mechanoreceptive nociceptors respond to a pressurestimulus that may cause injury. Polymodal nociceptorsare the most sensitive and can respond to temperatureand pressure. Polymodal nociceptors also respond tochemicals released by the cells in the area from whichthe pain originates.\\nNerve cell endings, or receptors, are at the front end\\nof pain sensation. A stimulus at this part of the nociceptorunleashes a cascade of neurotransmitters (chemicals thattransmit information within the nervous system) in thespine. Each neurotransmitter has a purpose. For example,substance P relays the pain message to nerves leading tothe spinal cord and brain. These neurotransmitters mayalso stimulate nerves leading back to the site of the injury.This response prompts cells in the injured area to releasechemicals that not only trigger an immune response, butalso influence the intensity and duration of the pain.\\nChronic and abnormal pain\\nChronic pain refers to pain that persists after an\\ninjury heals, cancer pain, pain related to a persistent or\\ndegenerative disease, and long-term pain from anunidentifiable cause. It is estimated that one in three peo-ple in the United States will experience chronic pain atsome point in their lives. Of these people, approximately50 million are either partially or completely disabled.\\nChronic pain may be caused by the body’s response\\nto acute pain. In the presence of continued stimulationof nociceptors, changes occur within the nervous sys-tem. Changes at the molecular level are dramatic andmay include alterations in genetic transcription of neu-rotransmitters and receptors. These changes may alsooccur in the absence of an identifiable cause; one of thefrustrating aspects of chronic pain is that the stimulusmay be unknown. For example, the stimulus cannot beidentified in as many as 85% of individuals sufferinglower back pain.\\nOther types of abnormal pain include allodynia,\\nhyperalgesia, and phantom limb pain. These types ofpain often arise from some damage to the nervous system(neuropathic). Allodynia refers to a feeling of pain inresponse to a normally harmless stimulus. For example,some individuals who have suffered nerve damage as aresult of viral infection experience unbearable pain fromjust the light weight of their clothing. Hyperalgesia issomewhat related to allodynia in that the response to apainful stimulus is extreme. In this case, a mild painstimulus, such as a pin prick, causes a maximum painresponse. Phantom limb pain occurs after a limb isamputated; although an individual may be missing thelimb, the nervous system continues to perceive pain orig-inating from the area.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPain is the most common symptom of injury and\\ndisease, and descriptions can range in intensity from amere ache to unbearable agony. Nociceptors have theability to convey information to the brain that indicatesthe location, nature, and intensity of the pain. For exam-ple, stepping on a nail sends an information-packed mes-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2459Pain'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 166}, page_content='sage to the brain: the foot has experienced a puncture\\nwound that hurts a lot.\\nPain perception also varies depending on the loca-\\ntion of the pain. The kinds of stimuli that cause a painresponse on the skin include pricking, cutting, crushing,burning, and freezing. These same stimuli would notgenerate much of a response in the intestine. Intestinalpain arises from stimuli such as swelling, inflammation,and distension.\\nDiagnosis\\nPain is considered in view of other symptoms and\\nindividual experiences. An observable injury, such as abroken bone, may be a clear indicator of the type of paina person is suffering. Determining the specific cause ofinternal pain is more difficult. Other symptoms, such asfever or nausea, help narrow down the possibilities. In\\nsome cases, such as lower back pain, a specific causemay not be identifiable. Diagnosis of the disease causinga specific pain is further complicated by the fact that paincan be referred to (felt at) a skin site that does not seemto be connected to the site of the pain’s origin. For exam-ple, pain arising from fluid accumulating at the base ofthe lung may be referred to the shoulder.\\nSince pain is a subjective experience, it may be very\\ndifficult to communicate its exact quality and intensity toother people. There are no diagnostic tests that can deter-mine the quality or intensity of an individual’s pain.Therefore, a medical examination will include a lot ofquestions about where the pain is located, its intensity,and its nature. Questions are also directed at what kindsof things increase or relieve the pain, how long it haslasted, and whether there are any variations in it. An indi-vidual may be asked to use a pain scale to describe thepain. One such scale assigns a number to the pain inten-sity; for example, 0 may indicate no pain, and 10 mayindicate the worst pain the person has ever experienced.Scales are modified for infants and children to accommo-date their level of comprehension.\\nTreatment\\nThere are many drugs aimed at preventing or treat-\\ning pain. Nonopioid analgesics , narcotic analgesics,\\nanticonvulsant drugs , and tricyclic antidepressants\\nwork by blocking the production, release, or uptake ofneurotransmitters. Drugs from different classes may becombined to handle certain types of pain.\\nNonopioid analgesics include common over-the-\\ncounter medications such as aspirin ,acetaminophen\\n(Tylenol), and ibuprofen (Advil). These are most oftenused for minor pain, but there are some prescription-strength medications in this class.Narcotic analgesics are only available with a doc-\\ntor’s prescription and are used for more severe pain, suchas cancer pain. These drugs include codeine, morphine,and methadone . Contrary to earlier beliefs, addiction to\\nthese painkillers is not common; people who genuinelyneed these drugs for pain control typically do not becomeaddicted. However, narcotic use should be limited topatients thought to have a short life span (such as peoplewith terminal cancer) or patients whose pain is onlyexpected to last for a short time (such as people recover-ing from surgery).\\nAnticonvulsants, as well as antidepressant drugs ,\\nwere initially developed to treat seizures and depression,respectively. However, it was discovered that these drugsalso have pain-killing applications. Furthermore, in casesof chronic or extreme pain, it is not unusual for an indi-vidual to suffer some degree of depression; therefore,antidepressants may serve a dual role. Commonly pre-scribed anticonvulsants for pain include phenytoin, car-bamazepine, and clonazepam. Tricyclic antidepressantsinclude doxepin, amitriptyline, and imipramine.\\nIntractable (unrelenting) pain may be treated by\\ninjections directly into or near the nerve that is transmit-ting the pain signal. These root blocks may also be usefulin determining the site of pain generation. As the under-lying mechanisms of abnormal pain are uncovered, otherpain medications are being developed.\\nDrugs are not always effective in controlling pain.\\nSurgical methods are used as a last resort if drugs andlocal anesthetics fail. The least destructive surgical pro-cedure involves implanting a device that emits electricalsignals. These signals disrupt the nerve and prevent itfrom transmitting the pain message. However, thismethod may not completely control pain and is not usedfrequently. Other surgical techniques involve destroyingor severing the nerve, but the use of this technique is lim-ited by side effects, including unpleasant numbness.\\nAlternative treatment\\nBoth physical and psychological aspects of pain can\\nbe dealt with through alternative treatment. Some of themost popular treatment options include acupressure and\\nacupuncture , massage, chiropractic , and relaxation\\ntechniques, such as yoga , hypnosis, and meditation .\\nHerbal therapies are gaining increased recognition asviable options; for example, capsaicin, the componentthat makes cayenne peppers spicy, is used in ointments torelieve the joint pain associated with arthritis.

The definition for damage is quite broad;pain can arise from injury as well as disease. After themessage is received and interpreted, further pain can becounter-productive. Pain can have a negative impact on aperson’s quality of life and impede recovery from illnessor injury. Unrelieved pain can become a syndrome in itsown right and cause a downward spiral in a person’shealth and outlook. Managing pain properly facilitatesrecovery, prevents additional health complications, andimproves an individual’s quality of life.\\nDescription\\nWhat is pain?\\nBefore considering pain management, a review of\\npain definitions and mechanisms may be useful. Pain isthe means by which the peripheral nervous system (PNS)warns the central nervous system (CNS) of injury orpotential injury to the body. The CNS comprises thebrain and spinal cord, and the PNS is composed of the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2461Pain management'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 168}, page_content='nerves that stem from and lead into the CNS. PNS\\nincludes all nerves throughout the body except the brainand spinal cord.\\nA pain message is transmitted to the CNS by special\\nPNS nerve cells called nociceptors. Nociceptors are dis-tributed throughout the body and respond to different stim-uli depending on their location. For example, nociceptorsthat extend from the skin are stimulated by sensations suchas pressure, temperature, and chemical changes.\\nWhen a nociceptor is stimulated, neurotransmitters\\nare released within the cell. Neurotransmitters are chemi-cals found within the nervous system that facilitate nervecell communication. The nociceptor transmits its signal tonerve cells within the spinal cord, which conveys the painmessage to the thalamus, a specific region in the brain.\\nOnce the brain has received and processed the pain\\nmessage and coordinated an appropriate response, painhas served its purpose. The body uses natural painkillers, called endorphins, that are meant to derail furtherpain messages from the same source. However, these nat-ural pain killers may not adequately dampen a continuingpain message. Also, depending on how the brain hasprocessed the pain information, certain hormones, suchas prostaglandins, may be released. These hormonesenhance the pain message and play a role in immune sys-tem responses to injury, such as inflammation. Certainneurotransmitters, especially substance P and calcitoningene- related peptide, actively enhance the pain messageat the injury site and within the spinal cord.\\nPain is generally divided into two categories: acute\\nand chronic. Nociceptive pain, or the pain that is trans-mitted by nociceptors, is typically called acute pain. Thiskind of pain is associated with injury, headaches, disease,and many other conditions. It usually resolves once thecondition that precipitated it is resolved.\\nFollowing some disorders, pain does not resolve.\\nEven after healing or a cure has been achieved, the braincontinues to perceive pain. In this situation, the pain maybe considered chronic. The time limit used to definechronic pain typically ranges from three to six months,although some healthcare professionals prefer a moreflexible definition, and consider chronic pain as pain thatendures beyond a normal healing time. The pain associ-ated with cancer , persistent and degenerative conditions,\\nand neuropathy, or nerve damage, is included in thechronic category. Also, unremitting pain that lacks anidentifiable physical cause, such as the majority of casesof low back pain , may be considered chronic. The\\nunderlying biochemistry of chronic pain appears to bedifferent from regular nociceptive pain.\\nIt has been hypothesized that uninterrupted and\\nunrelenting pain can induce changes in the spinal cord.In the past, intractable pain has been treated by severing\\na nerve’s connection to the CNS. However, the lack ofany sensory information being relayed by that nerve cancause pain transmission in the spinal cord to go intooverdrive, as evidenced by the phantom limb pain experi-enced by amputees. Evidence is accumulating that unre-lenting pain or the complete lack of nerve signalsincreases the number of pain receptors in the spinal cord.Nerve cells in the spinal cord may also begin secretingpain-amplifying neurotransmitters independent of actualpain signals from the body. Immune chemicals, primarilycytokines, may play a prominent role in such changes.\\nManaging pain\\nConsidering the different causes and types of pain,\\nas well as its nature and intensity, management canrequire an interdisciplinary approach. The elements ofthis approach include treating the underlying cause ofpain, pharmacological and nonpharmacological thera-pies, and some invasive (surgical) procedures.\\nTreating the cause of pain underpins the idea of\\nmanaging it. Injuries are repaired, diseases are diag-nosed, and certain encounters with pain can be anticipat-ed and treated prophylactically (by prevention). Howev-er, there are no guarantees of immediate relief from pain.Recovery can be impeded by pain and quality of life canbe damaged. Therefore, pharmacological and other ther-apies have developed over time to address these aspectsof disease and injury.\\nPHARMACOLOGICAL OPTIONS. Pain-relieving drugs,\\notherwise called analgesics , include nonsteroidal anti-\\ninflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen , nar-\\ncotics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and others.NSAIDs and acetaminophen are available as over-the-counter and prescription medications, and are frequentlythe initial pharmacological treatment for pain. These drugscan also be used as adjuncts to the other drug therapies,which might require a doctor’s prescription.\\nNSAIDs include aspirin , ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil,\\nNuprin), naproxen sodium (Aleve), and ketoprofen(Orudis KT). These drugs are used to treat pain frominflammation and work by blocking production of pain-enhancing neurotransmitters, such as prostaglandins.Acetaminophen is also effective against pain, but its abil-ity to reduce inflammation is limited.\\nNSAIDs and acetaminophen are effective for most\\nforms of acute (sharp, but of a short course) pain, butmoderate and severe pain may require stronger medica-tion. Narcotics handle intense pain effectively, and areused for cancer pain and acute pain that does not respondto NSAIDs and acetaminophen. Narcotics are classifiedas either opiates or opioids, and are available only with a\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2462Pain management'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 169}, page_content='doctor’s prescription. Opiates include morphine and\\ncodeine, which are derived from opium, a substance nat-urally found in some poppy species. Opioids are synthet-ic drugs based on the structure of opium. This drug classincludes drugs such as oxycodon, methadone , and\\nmeperidine (Demerol).\\nNarcotics may be ineffective against some forms of\\nchronic pain, especially since changes in the spinal cordmay alter the usual pain signaling pathways. Further-more, narcotics are usually not recommended for long-term use because the body develops a tolerance to nar-cotics, reducing their effectiveness over time. In such sit-uations, pain can be managed with antidepressants andanticonvulsants, which are also only available with adoctor’s prescription.\\nAlthough antidepressant drugs were developed to\\ntreat depression, it has been discovered that they are alsoeffective in combating chronic headaches, cancer pain,and pain associated with nerve damage. Antidepressantsthat have been shown to have analgesic (pain reducing)properties include amitriptyline (Elavil), trazodone(Desyrel), and imipramine (Tofranil). Anticonvulsant\\ndrugs share a similar background with antidepressants.\\nDeveloped to treat epilepsy, anticonvulsants were foundto relieve pain as well. Drugs such as phenytoin (Dilan-tin) and carbamazepine (Tegretol) are prescribed to treatthe pain associated with nerve damage.\\nOther prescription drugs are used to treat specific\\ntypes of pain or specific pain syndromes. For example,corticosteroids are very effective against pain caused by\\ninflammation and swelling, and sumatriptan (Imitrex)was developed to treat migraine headaches.\\nDrug administration depends on the drug type and\\nthe required dose. Some drugs are not absorbed very wellfrom the stomach and must be injected or administeredintravenously. Injections and intravenous administrationmay also be used when high doses are needed or if anindividual is nauseous. Following surgery and other med-ical procedures, patients may have the option of control-ling the pain medication themselves. By pressing a but-ton, they can release a set dose of medication into anintravenous solution. This procedure has also beenemployed in other situations requiring pain management.Another mode of administration involves implantedcatheters that deliver pain medication directly to thespinal cord. Delivering drugs in this way can reduce sideeffects and increase the effectiveness of the drug.\\nNONPHARMACOLOGICAL OPTIONS. Pain treatment\\noptions that do not use drugs are often used as adjunctsto, rather than replacements for, drug therapy. One of thebenefits of non-drug therapies is that an individual cantake a more active stance against pain. Relaxation tech-niques, such as yoga and meditation , are used to\\ndecrease muscle tension and reduce stress . Tension and\\nstress can also be reduced through biofeedback ,i n\\nwhich an individual consciously attempts to modify skintemperature, muscle tension, blood pressure, and heartrate.\\nParticipating in normal activities and exercising can\\nalso help control pain levels. Through physical therapy,an individual learns beneficial exercises for reducingstress, strengthening muscles, and staying fit. Regularexercise has been linked to production of endorphins, the\\nbody’s natural pain killers.\\nAcupuncture involves the insertion of small needles\\ninto the skin at key points. Acupressure uses these same\\nkey points, but involves applying pressure rather thaninserting needles. Both of these methods may work byprompting the body to release endorphins. Applying heator being massaged are very relaxing and help reducestress. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation\\n(TENS) applies a small electric current to certain parts ofnerves, potentially interrupting pain signals and inducingrelease of endorphins. To be effective, use of TENSshould be medically supervised.\\nINVASIVE PROCEDURES. There are three types of\\ninvasive procedures that may be used to manage or treatpain: anatomic, augmentative, and ablative. These proce-dures involve surgery, and certain guidelines should befollowed before carrying out a procedure with permanenteffects. First, the cause of the pain must be clearly identi-fied. Next, surgery should be done only if noninvasiveprocedures are ineffective. Third, any psychologicalissues should be addressed. Finally, there should be areasonable expectation of success.\\nAnatomic procedures involve correcting the injury\\nor removing the cause of pain. Relatively commonanatomic procedures are decompression surgeries, suchas repairing a herniated disk in the lower back or reliev-\\ning the nerve compression related to carpal tunnel syn-\\ndrome . Another anatomic procedure is neurolysis, also\\ncalled a nerve block, which involves destroying a portionof a peripheral nerve.\\nAugmentative procedures include electrical stimula-\\ntion or direct application of drugs to the nerves that aretransmitting the pain signals. Electrical stimulationworks on the same principle as TENS. In this procedure,instead of applying the current across the skin, electrodesare implanted to stimulate peripheral nerves or nerves inthe spinal cord. Augmentative procedures also includeimplanted drug-delivery systems. In these systems,catheters are implanted in the spine to allow direct deliv-ery of drugs to the CNS.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2463Pain management'),\n",

However, thismethod may not address potential alterations within thespinal cord.

With growing understand-ing of neuropathic pain and development of less invasiveprocedures, ablative procedures are used less frequently.However, they do have applications in select cases ofperipheral neuropathy , cancer pain, and other disorders.\\nPreparation\\nPrior to beginning management, pain is thoroughly\\nevaluated.

NSAIDs have the well-known sideeffect of causing gastrointestinal bleeding, and long-termuse of acetaminophen has been linked to kidney and liverdamage. Other drugs, especially narcotics, have seriousside effects, such as constipation , drowsiness, and nau-\\nsea. Serious side effects can also accompany pharmaco-logical therapies; mood swings, confusion, bone thin-ning, cataract formation, increased blood pressure, andother problems may discourage or prevent use of someanalgesics.\\nNonpharmacological therapies carry little or no risk.\\nHowever, it is advised that individuals recovering fromserious illness or injury consult with their health careproviders or physical therapists before making use ofadjunct therapies. Invasive procedures carry risks similarto other surgical procedures, such as infection, reactionto anesthesia, iatrogenic (injury as a result of treatment)injury, and failure.\\nA traditional concern about narcotics use has been\\nthe risk of promoting addiction . As narcotic use contin-\\nues over time, the body becomes accustomed to the drugand adjusts normal functions to accommodate to its pres-ence. Therefore, to elicit the same level of action, it isnecessary to increase dosage over time. As dosageincreases, an individual may become physically depen-dent on narcotic drugs.\\nHowever, physical dependence is different from psy-\\nchological addiction. Physical dependence is character-ized by discomfort if drug administration suddenly stops,while psychological addiction is characterized by anoverpowering craving for the drug for reasons other thanpain relief. Psychological addiction is a very real andnecessary concern in some instances, but it should notinterfere with a genuine need for narcotic pain relief.However, caution must be taken with people with a histo-ry of addictive behavior.\\nNormal results\\nEffective application of pain management tech-\\nniques reduces or eliminates acute or chronic pain.

It can appear to skip beats, beat rapidly, beat irregu-larly, or thump in the chest. Although palpitations are verycommon and often harmless, they can be frightening to theperson, who is usually unaware of his or her heartbeat.\\nPalpitations can also be a sign of serious heart trou-\\nble. Palpitations that are caused by certain types ofabnormal heart rhythms ( arrhythmias ) can be serious,\\nand even fatal if left untreated. Recognizable arrhythmiasare present in a small number of patients who have palpi-tations. Immediate medical attention should be soughtfor palpitations that feel like a very fast series of heart-beats, last more than two or three minutes, and are unre-lated to strenuous physical activity, obvious fright, oranger. Medical attention should also be sought if palpita-tions are accompanied by chest pain ,dizziness ,short-\\nness of breath , or an overall feeling of weakness.\\nMost people have experienced a skipped or missed\\nheartbeat, which is really an early beat and not a skippedbeat at all. After a premature heartbeat, the heart rests foran instant then beats with extra force, making the personfeel as if the heart has skipped a beat. This type of palpi-tation is nothing to worry about unless it occurs frequent-ly. Severe palpitations feel like a thudding or flutteringsensation in the chest. After chest pain, palpitations arethe most common reason that people are referred for car-diology evaluation.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPalpitations can be caused by anxiety , arrhythmias,\\ncaffeine , certain medications, cocaine and other amphet-\\namines, emotional stress , overeating, panic, somatiza-\\ntion, and vigorous exercise . There may be no other\\nsymptoms. But, anxiety, dizziness, shortness of breath,and chest pain may be signs of more severe arrhythmias.\\nDiagnosis\\nPalpitations are diagnosed through a medical history, a\\nphysical examination , an electrocardiogram (ECG), and\\nscreening for psychiatric disorders. It is often difficult todistinguish palpitations from panic disorder , a common\\nproblem in which the person experiences frequent andunexplained “fight-or-flight” responses, which is thebody’s natural physical reaction to extreme danger or phys-ical exertion, but without the obvious external stimulus.\\nTo accurately diagnose palpitations, one of the irreg-\\nular heartbeats must be “captured” on an EKG, whichshows the heart’s activity. Electrodes covered with a typeof gel that conducts electrical impulses are placed on thepatient’s chest, arms, and legs. These electrodes sendimpulses of the heart’s activity to a recorder, whichtraces them on paper. This electrocardiography test\\ntakes about 10 minutes and is performed in a physician’soffice or hospital. Because the palpitations are unlikelyto occur during a standard EKG, Holter monitoring is\\noften performed. In this procedure, the patient wears asmall, portable tape recorder that is attached to a belt orshoulder strap and connected to electrode disks on his orher chest. The Holter monitor records the heart’s rhythmduring normal activities. Some medical centers are nowusing event recorders that the patient can carry for weeksor months. When the palpitations occur, the patient\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2465Palpitations'),\n",

Persistent\\npalpitations can be treated with small doses of a betablocker. Beta blockers are drugs that tend to lower blood\\npressure. They slow the heart rate and decrease the forcewith which the heart pumps. If the cause of the palpita-tions is determined to be an arrhythmia, medical or surgi-cal treatment may be prescribed, although surgery israrely needed.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments for palpitations should be used\\nonly as a complement to traditional medicine. Alternativetreatments include: aromatherapy , Chinese herbs, herbal\\ntherapies, homeopathic medicine, exercise, mind/bodymedicine, and diet and nutrition . In aromatherapy,\\nadding citrus oils to bath water may help with minor pal-pitations. Some Chinese herbs can also help, but otherscan worsen arrhythmias, so a qualified herbalist should beconsulted. Herbal therapies such as hawthorn ( Crataegus\\nlaevigata ) and motherwort ( Leonurus cardiaca ) can help\\nwith palpitations. Homeopathic remedies such as Lach-\\nesis, Digitalis, and Aconite (Aconitum nnapellus ) may be\\nused to control palpitations but should be taken onlywhen prescribed by a homeopathic physician. Mind/bodymedicine such as meditation and yoga can help the per-\\nson relax, eliminating or reducing palpitations caused byanxiety or stress. Reducing or eliminating tea, cola, cof-fee, and chocolate, and consuming adequate amounts ofthe minerals calcium, magnesium, and potassium can\\nhelp reduce or eliminate palpitations.\\nPrognosis\\nMost palpitations are harmless, but some can be a\\nsign of heart trouble, which could be fatal if left untreated.KEY TERMS\\nArrhythmia —Any variation from the normal heart-\\nbeat. Some arrhythmias are harmless, while oth-ers, such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricularfibrillation, and ventricular standstill, can be fatal.\\nSomatization —Anxiety converted into physical\\nsymptoms. Somatization is a sign of panic disorder.Prevention\\nPalpitations not caused by arrhythmias can be pre-\\nvented by reducing or eliminating anxiety and emotionalstress, and reducing or eliminating consumption of tea,cola, coffee, and chocolate. Exercise can also help, but atreadmill stress test performed by a physician should be\\nconsidered first to make sure the exercise is safe.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\n“Heart Palpitations.” In New Choices in Natural Healing ,e d .\\nBill Gottlieb, et al.

The thick-est part of the pancreas near the duodenum (small intestine)is called the head, the middle part is called the body, andthe thinnest part adjacent to the spleen is called the tail.\\nWhile surgical removal of tumors in the pancreas is\\npreferred, it is only possible in the 10-15% of patientswho are diagnosed early enough for a potential cure.Patients who are considered suitable for surgery usuallyhave small tumors in the head of the pancreas (close tothe duodenum, or first part of the small intestine), havejaundice as their initial symptom, and have no evidence\\nof metastatic disease (spread of cancer to other sites).\\nPancreatectomy is sometimes necessary when the\\npancreas has been severely injured by trauma, especiallyinjury to the body and tail of the pancreas. While suchsurgery removes normal pancreatic tissue as well, thelong-term consequences of this surgery are minimal,with virtually no effects on the production of insulin,digestive enzymes, and other hormones.\\nChronic pancreatitis is another condition for which\\npancreatectomy is occasionally performed. Chronic pan-creatitis—or continuing inflammation of the pancreasthat results in permanent damage to this organ—candevelop from long-standing, recurring episodes of acute(periodic) pancreatitis. This painful condition usuallyresults from alcohol abuse or the presence of gallstones .\\nIn most patients with alcohol-induced disease, the pan-creas is widely involved, therefore, surgical correction isalmost impossible.\\nPrecautions\\nPancreatectomy is only performed when surgery\\nprovides a clear benefit. Patients who have tumors thatare obviously not operable should be carefully excludedfrom consideration.\\nDescription\\nPancreatectomy sometimes entails removal of the\\nentire pancreas, called a total pancreatectomy, but moreoften involves removal of part of the pancreas, which iscalled a subtotal pancreatectomy, or distal pancreatecto-my, when the body and tail of the pancreas are removed.When the duodenum is removed along with all or part ofthe pancreas, the procedure is called a pancreaticoduo-denectomy, which surgeons sometimes refer to as“Whipple’s procedure.” Pancreaticoduodenectomy isbeing used increasingly for treatment of a variety ofmalignant and benign diseases of the pancreas.Regional lymph nodes are usually removed during\\npancreaticoduodenectomy. In distal pancreatectomy, thespleen may also be removed.\\nPreparation\\nPatients with symptoms of a pancreatic disorder\\nusually undergo a number of tests before surgery iseven considered. These can include ultrasonography, x-ray examinations, computed tomography scans (CTscan), and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancre-\\natography (ERCP), an x-ray imaging technique. Tests\\nmay also include angiography , an x-ray technique for\\nvisualizing the arteries feeding the pancreas, and needleaspiration cytology, in which cells are drawn from areassuspected to contain cancer. Such tests aid in the diag-nosis of the pancreatic disorder and in the planning ofthe operation.\\nSince many patients with pancreatic cancer are\\nundernourished, appropriate nutritional support, some-times by tube feedings , may be required prior to surgery.\\nSome patients with pancreatic cancer deemed suit-\\nable for pancreatectomy will undergo chemotherapy\\nand/or radiation therapy . This treatment is aimed at\\nshrinking the tumor, which will improve the chances forsuccessful surgical removal. Sometimes, patients whoare not initially considered surgical candidates mayrespond so well to chemoradiation that surgical treatmentbecomes possible. Radiation therapy may also be appliedduring the surgery (intraoperatively) to improve thepatient’s chances of survival, but this treatment is not yetin routine use. Some studies have shown that intraopera-tive radiation therapy extends survival by several months.\\nPatients undergoing distal pancreatectomy that\\ninvolves removal of the spleen may receive preoperativemedication to decrease the risk of infection.\\nAftercare\\nPancreatectomy is major surgery. Therefore, extend-\\ned hospitalization is usually required. Some studiesreport an average hospital stay of about two weeks.\\nSome cancer patients may also receive combined\\nchemotherapy and radiation therapy after surgery. Thisadditional treatment has been clearly shown to enhancesurvival from pancreatic cancer.\\nRemoval of all or part of the pancreas can lead to a\\ncondition called pancreatic insufficiency, in which foodcannot be normally processed by the body, and insulinsecretion may be inadequate. These conditions can betreated with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, tosupply digestive enzymes, and insulin injections, to sup-ply insulin.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2469Pancreatectomy'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 176}, page_content='Risks\\nThe mortality rate for pancreatectomy has improved\\nin recent years to 5–10%, depending on the extent of thesurgery and the experience of the surgeon. A study of650 patients at Johns Hopkins Medical Institution, Balti-more, found that only nine patients, or 1.4%, died fromcomplications related to surgery.\\nThere is still, however, a fairly high risk of compli-\\ncations following any form of pancreatectomy. TheJohns Hopkins study documented complications in 41%of cases. The most devastating complication is postoper-ative bleeding, which increases the mortality risk to 20-50%. In cases of postoperative bleeding, the patient maybe returned to surgery to find the source of hemorrhage,or may undergo other procedures to stop the bleeding.\\nOne of the most common complications from a pan-\\ncreaticoduodenectomy is delayed gastric emptying, acondition in which food and liquids are slow to leave thestomach. This complication occurred in 19% of patientsin the Johns Hopkins study. To manage this problem,many surgeons insert feeding tubes at the original opera-tion site, through which nutrients can be fed directly intothe patient’s intestines. This procedure, called enteralnutrition , maintains the patient’s nutrition if the stomach\\nis slow to recover normal function. Certain medications,called promotility agents, can help move the nutritionalcontents through the gastrointestinal tract.KEY TERMS\\nChemotherapy —A treatment of the cancer with\\nsynthetic drugs that destroy the tumor either byinhibiting the growth of the cancerous cells or bykilling the cancer cells.\\nComputed tomography (CT) scan —A medical pro-\\ncedure where a series of x rays are taken and puttogether by a computer in order to form detailedpictures of areas inside the body.\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) —A medical\\nprocedure used for diagnostic purposes where pic-tures of areas inside the body can be created usinga magnet linked to a computer.\\nPancreas —A large gland located on the back wall\\nof the abdomen, extending from the duodenum(first part of the small intestine) to the spleen.

Alsoknown as “Whipple’s procedure” or “Whipple’soperation”.\\nPancreatitis —Inflammation of the pancreas, either\\nacute (sudden and episodic) or chronic, usuallycaused by excessive alcohol intake or gallbladderdisease.\\nRadiation therapy —A treatment using high energy\\nradiation from x-ray machines, cobalt, radium, orother sources.\\nUltrasonogram —A procedure where high-frequen-\\ncy sound waves that cannot be heard by humanears are bounced off internal organs and tissues.These sound waves produce a pattern of echoeswhich are then used by the computer to createsonograms or pictures of areas inside the body.\\nThe other most common complication is pancreatic\\nanastomotic leak. This is a leak in the connection that thesurgeon makes between the remainder of the pancreasand the other structures in the abdomen. Most surgeonshandle the potential for this problem by assuring thatthere will be adequate drainage from the surgical site.\\nNormal results\\nUnfortunately, pancreatic cancer is the most lethal\\nform of gastrointestinal malignancy. However, for ahighly selective group of patients, pancreatectomy offersa chance for cure, especially when performed by experi-enced surgeons. The overall five-year survival rate forpatients who undergo pancreatectomy for pancreatic can-cer is about 10%; patients who undergo pancreaticoduo-denectomy have a 4–5% survival at five years. The riskfor tumor recurrence is thought to be unaffected bywhether the patient undergoes a total pancreatectomy ora pancreaticoduodenectomy, but is increased when thetumor is larger than 3 cm and the cancer has spread to thelymph nodes or surrounding tissue.\\nAfter total pancreatectomy, the body loses the ability\\nto secrete insulin, enzymes, and other substances, there-fore, certain medications will be required to compensatefor this. In some cases of pancreatic disease, the pancreasceases to function normally, then total pancreatectomy maybe preferable to other less radical forms of the operation.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2470Pancreatectomy'),\n",

Helwick\\nPancreatic cancer, endocrine\\nDefinition\\nEndocrine pancreatic cancer is a disease in which\\ncancerous cells originate within the tissues of the pan-creas that produce hormones.\\nDescription\\nThe pancreas is a 6–8 in (15–20 cm) long, slipper-\\nshaped gland located in the abdomen. It lies behind thestomach, within a loop formed by the small intestine.Other nearby organs include the gallbladder, spleen, andliver. The pancreas has a wide end (head), a narrow end(tail), and a middle section (body). A healthy pancreas isimportant for normal food digestion and plays a criticalrole in the body’s metabolic processes. The pancreas hastwo main functions, each performed by distinct types oftissue. The exocrine tissue secretes fluids into the otherorgans of the digestive system, while the endocrine tissuesecretes substances that are circulated in the bloodstream.The exocrine pancreas makes up the vast majority of thegland; it produces pancreatic juices containing enzymesthat help break down proteins and fatty food. Theendocrine tissue of the pancreas makes up only 2% of thegland’s total mass. It consists of small patches of cells thatproduce hormones (like insulin) that control how thebody stores and uses nutrients. These patches are calledislets (islands) of Langerhans or islet cells and are inter-spersed evenly throughout the pancreas. Each islet con-tains approximately 1,000 endocrine cells and a densenetwork of capillaries (tiny blood vessels), which allowsimmediate entry of hormones into the circulatory system.\\nPancreatic tumors are classified as either exocrine or\\nendocrine tumors depending on which type of tissue theyarise from within the gland. Endocrine tumors of thepancreas are very rare, accounting for only 5% of allpancreatic cancers. The majority of endocrine pancreatictumors are functional adenocarcinomas that overproducea specific hormone. There are several types of islet cellsand each produces its own hormone or peptide (smallprotein molecule). Functional endocrine tumors arenamed after the hormone they secrete. Insulinoma is themost common tumor of the endocrine pancreas. Patientswith this disease usually develop hypoglycemia due toincreased insulin production that leads to abnormally lowblood sugar levels. Gastrinoma, a disease in which gas-trin (hormone that stimulates stomach acid production) isoverproduced, causes multiple ulcers in the upper gas-trointestinal (GI) tract. Gastrinoma was first described inpatients with a rare form of severe peptic ulcer diseaseknown as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES). The lesscommon glucagonoma causes mild diabetes due toexcess glucagon (hormone that stimulates glucose pro-duction) secretion. Other rare islet cell tumors includevipoma (vasoactive intestinal peptide) and somatostatin-oma. Nonfunctional pancreatic endocrine tumors are notassociated with an excess production of any hormoneand can be difficult to distinguish from exocrine pancre-atic cancer. Cancers of the endocrine pancreas are rela-tively slow-growing compared to the more common duc-tal adenocarcinomas of the exocrine pancreas.\\nBetween one and four cases of insulinoma occur per\\nmillion people per year, and 90% of these tumors arebenign. They occur mostly between the ages of 50 and 60and affect men and women equally. Less than three casesof gastrinoma per million people are diagnosed each year,but it is the most common functional islet cell tumor inpatients with multiple endocrine tumors, a conditionknown as multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome.Vipoma and glucagonoma are even rarer and they occurmore frequently in women. Somatostatinoma is exceeding-ly uncommon, and less than 100 cases have been reportedworldwide. Nonfunctional islet cell cancers account forapproximately one-third of all cancers of the endocrinepancreas, and the majority of these are malignant.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are no known causes of islet cell cancer, but a\\nsmall percentage of cases occur due to hereditary syn-dromes such as MEN. This is a condition that frequently\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2471Pancreatic cancer, endocrine'),\n",

Twenty-five percent of gastri-nomas and less than 10% of insulinomas occur in MENpatients. V on Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is anothergenetic disorder that causes multiple tumors, and10–15% of VHL patients will develop islet cell cancer.\\nSymptoms vary among the different islet cell cancer\\ntypes. Insulinoma causes repeated episodes of hypo-glycemia, sweating, and tremors, while patients with gas-trinoma have inflammation of the esophagus, epigastricpain, multiple ulcers, and possibly diarrhea. Symptoms ofglucagonoma include a distinctive skin rash, inflammationof the stomach, glucose intolerance, weight loss, weak-ness, and anemia (less common). Patients with vipomahave episodes of profuse, watery diarrhea, even after fast-ing. Somatostatinoma causes mild diabetes, diarrhea/steat-orrhea (fatty stools), weight loss, and gallbladder disease.Nonfunctional endocrine tumors frequently produce thesame symptoms as cancer of the exocrine pancreas such asabdominal pain, jaundice, and weight loss.\\nDiagnosis\\nA thorough physical exam is usually performed\\nwhen a patient presents with the above symptoms, how-ever, functional endocrine tumors of the pancreas tend tobe small and are not detected by palpating the abdomen.Once other illnesses such as infection are ruled out, thedoctor will order a series of blood and urine tests. Thefunctional endocrine tumors can be identified throughincreased levels of hormone in the bloodstream.\\nFunctional endocrine tumors can occur in multiple\\nsites in the pancreas and are often small (less than 1 cm),making them difficult to diagnose. Nonfunctional tumorstend to be larger, which makes them difficult to distin-guish from tumors of the exocrine pancreas. Methodssuch as computed tomography (CT) scan and magneticresonance imaging (MRI) are used to take pictures of theinternal organs and allow the doctor to determine whethera tumor is present. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy(trade name OctreoScan) is an imaging system used tolocalize endocrine tumors, especially gastrinomas andsomatostatinomas. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is amore sensitive technique that may be used if a CT scanfails to detect a tumor. Endocrine tumors usually havemany blood vessels, so angiography may be useful in thedoctor’s assessment and staging of the tumor. Surgicalexploration is sometimes necessary in order to locate verysmall tumors that occur in multiple sites. These tech-niques also help the doctor evaluate how far the tumor hasspread. A biopsy can be taken to confirm diagnosis, butmore often, doctors look at the size and local invasion ofthe tumor in order to plan a treatment strategy.Treatment\\nStaging\\nThe staging system for islet cell cancer is still evolv-\\ning, but the tumors typically fall into three categories:cancers that arise in one location within the pancreas,cancers that arise in several locations within the pan-creas, and cancers that have spread to nearby lymphnodes or to other organs in the body.\\nSurgery is the only curative method for islet cell can-\\ncers, and studies have shown that an aggressive surgicalapproach can improve survival and alleviate symptoms ofthe disease. As with most forms of cancer, the earlier it isdiagnosed, the greater the chance for survival. With theexception of insulinoma, the majority of islet cell tumorsare malignant at the time of diagnosis, and more than halfare metastatic. However, surgery and chemotherapy havebeen shown to improve the outcome of patients even ifthey have metastatic disease. Surgery may include partialor total removal of the pancreas, and in patients with gas-trinoma, the stomach may be removed as well. Streptozo-tocin, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) arechemotherapeutic agents commonly used in the treatmentof islet cell cancer. Patients may experience nausea andvomiting as well as kidney toxicity from streptozotocin,and bone marrow suppression from doxorubicin. Hor-mone therapy is used to relieve the symptoms of function-al tumors by inhibiting excess hormone production. Othertechniques may be used to block blood flow to the liver inan attempt to kill the cancer cells that have spread there.Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and fever may resultfrom this type of treatment. Radiation has little if any rolein the treatment of islet cell cancer.\\nPrognosis\\nIslet cell cancers overall have a more favorable prog-\\nnosis than cancers of the exocrine pancreas, and themedian survival from diagnosis is three and a half years.This is mainly due to their slow-growing nature. Insuli-nomas have a five-year survival rate of 80% and gastri-nomas have 65%. When malignant, islet cell cancers donot generally respond well to chemotherapy, and thetreatment is mainly palliative. Most patients with metas-tasis do not survive five years. Islet cell cancer tends tospread to the surrounding lymph nodes, stomach, smallintestine, and liver.\\nPrevention\\nThere are no known risk factors associated with spo-\\nradic islet cell cancer. Therefore, it is not clear how toprevent its occurrence.

Unless specified, near-\\nly all reports on pancreatic cancer refer to ductal adeno-carcinomas. Less common types of pancreatic exocrinetumors include acinar cell carcinoma, cystic tumors thatare typically benign but may become cancerous, and pap-illary tumors that grow within the pancreatic ducts. Pan-creatoblastoma is a very rare disease that primarily affectsyoung children. Two-thirds of pancreatic tumors occur inthe head of the pancreas, and tumor growth in this areacan lead to the obstruction of the nearby common bileduct that empties bile fluid into the small intestine. Whenbile cannot be passed into the intestine, patients maydevelop yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) due tothe buildup of bilirubin (a component of bile) in thebloodstream. Tumor blockage of bile or pancreatic ductsmay also cause digestive problems since these fluids con-tain critical enzymes in the digestive process. Dependingon their size, pancreatic tumors may cause abdominalpain by pressing on the surrounding nerves. Because ofits location deep within the abdomen, pancreatic canceroften remains undetected until it has spread to otherorgans such as the liver or lung. Pancreatic cancer tends torapidly spread to other organs, even when the primary(original) tumor is relatively small.\\nThough pancreatic cancer accounts for only 3% of all\\ncancers, it is the fifth most frequent cause of cancerdeaths. In 2001, an estimated 29,200 new cases of pancre-atic cancer will be diagnosed in the United States. Pancre-atic cancer is primarily a disease associated withadvanced age, with 80% of cases occurring between theages of 60 and 80. Men are almost twice as likely todevelop this disease than women. Countries with thehighest frequencies of pancreatic cancer include the Unit-ed States, New Zealand, Western European nations, andScandinavia. The lowest occurrences of the disease arereported in India, Kuwait, and Singapore. African-Ameri-cans have the highest incidence of pancreatic cancer ofany ethnic group worldwide. Whether this difference isdue to diet or environmental factors remains unclear.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAlthough the exact cause for pancreatic cancer is\\nnot known, several risk factors have been shown toincrease susceptibility to this particular cancer, thegreatest of which is cigarette smoking. Approximatelyone-third of pancreatic cancer cases occur among smok-ers. People who have diabetes develop pancreatic cancertwice as often as non-diabetics. Numerous studies sug-gest that a family history of pancreatic cancer is anotherstrong risk factor for developing the disease, particularlyif two or more relatives in the immediate family have thedisease. Other risk factors include chronic (long-term)inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), diets high infat, and occupational exposure to certain chemicals such\\nas petroleum.\\nPancreatic cancer often does not produce symptoms\\nuntil it reaches an advanced stage. Patients may then pre-sent with the following signs and symptoms:\\n• upper abdominal and/or back pain\\n• jaundice\\n• weight loss\\n• loss of appetite• diarrhea\\n• weakness\\n• nausea\\nThese symptoms may also be caused by other ill-\\nnesses; therefore, it is important to consult a doctor foran accurate diagnosis.\\nDiagnosis\\nPancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose, especially\\nin the absence of symptoms, and there is no currentscreening method for early detection. The most sophisti-cated techniques available often do not detect very smalltumors that are localized (have not begun to spread). Atadvanced stages where patients show symptoms, a num-ber of tests may be performed to confirm diagnosis andto assess the stage of the disease. Approximately half ofall pancreatic cancers are metastatic (have spread toother sites) at the time of diagnosis.\\nThe first step in diagnosing pancreatic cancer is a\\nthorough medical history and complete physical exami-nation. The abdomen will be palpated to check for fluidaccumulation, lumps, or masses. If there are signs ofjaundice, blood tests will be performed to rule out thepossibility of liver diseases such as hepatitis. Urine andstool tests may be performed as well.\\nNon-invasive imaging tools such as computed\\ntomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) can be used to produce detailed pictures of theinternal organs. CT is the tool most often used to diag-nose pancreatic cancer, as it allows the doctor to deter-mine if the tumor can be removed by surgery or not. It isalso useful in staging a tumor by showing the extent towhich the tumor has spread. During a CT scan, patientsreceive an intravenous injection of a contrast dye so theorgans can be visualized more clearly. MRI may be per-formed instead of CT if a patient has an allergy to the CTcontrast dye. In some cases where the tumor is impingingon blood vessels or nearby ducts, MRI may be used togenerate an image of the pancreatic ducts.\\nIf the doctor suspects pancreatic cancer and no visi-\\nble masses are seen with a CT scan, a patient may under-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2474Pancreatic cancer, exocrine'),\n",

Endoscopic ultrasound(EUS) involves the use of an ultrasound probe at the endof a long, flexible tube that is passed down the patient’sthroat and into the stomach. This instrument can detect atumor mass through high frequency sound waves andechoes. EUS can be accompanied by fine needle aspira-tion (FNA), where a long needle, guided by the ultra-sound, is inserted into the tumor mass in order to take abiopsy sample. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancre-atography (ERCP) is a technique often used in patientswith severe jaundice because it enables the doctor torelieve blockage of the pancreatic ducts. The doctor,guided by endoscopy and x rays, inserts a small metal orplastic stent into the duct to keep it open. During ERCP, abiopsy can be done by collecting cells from the pancreaswith a small brush. The cells are then examined under themicroscope by a pathologist, who determines the pres-ence of any cancerous cells.\\nIn some cases, a biopsy may be performed during a\\ntype of surgery called laparoscopy, which is done undergeneral anesthesia. Doctors insert a small camera andinstruments into the abdomen after a minor incision ismade. Tissue samples are removed for examinationunder the microscope. This procedure allows a doctor todetermine the extent to which the disease has spread anddecide if the tumor can be removed by further surgery.KEY TERMS\\nAcinar cell carcinoma —A malignant tumor arising\\nfrom the acinar cells of the pancreas.\\nAngiography —Diagnostic technique used to study\\nblood vessels in a tumor.\\nBiopsy —Removal and microscopic examination of\\ncells to determine whether they are cancerous.\\nCancer vaccines —A treatment that uses the\\npatient’s immune system to attack cancer cells.\\nChemotherapy —Drug treatment administered to\\nkill cancerous cells.\\nDuctal adenocarcinoma —A malignant tumor aris-\\ning from the duct cells within a gland.\\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography\\n(ERCP) —Diagnostic technique used to obtain a\\nbiopsy.

The test requireslocal anesthesia and a catheter is inserted into thepatient’s upper thigh. A dye is then injected into bloodvessels that lead into the pancreas, and x rays are taken.\\nAs of April 2001, doctors at major cancer research\\ninstitutions such as Memorial Sloan-Kettering CancerCenter in New York are investigating CT angiography, animaging technique that is less invasive than angiographyalone. CT angiography is similar to a standard CT scan,but allows doctors to take a series of pictures of the bloodvessels that support tumor growth. A dye is injected as ina CT scan (but at rapid intervals) and no catheter or seda-tion is required. A computer generates 3D images fromthe pictures that are taken, and the information is gath-ered by the surgical team who will develop an appropri-ate strategy if the patient’s disease can be operated on.\\nTreatment\\nStaging\\nAfter cancer of the pancreas has been diagnosed,\\ndoctors typically use a TNM staging system to classifythe tumor based on its size and the degree to which it has\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2475Pancreatic cancer, exocrine'),\n",

T indicates the size and\\nlocal advancement of the primary tumor. Since cancersoften invade the lymphatic system before spreading toother organs, regional lymph node involvement (N) is animportant factor in staging. M indicates whether thetumor has metastasized (spread) to distant organs. Instage I, the tumor is localized to the pancreas and has notspread to surrounding lymph nodes or other organs.Stage II pancreatic cancer has spread to nearby organssuch as the small intestine or bile duct, but not the sur-rounding lymph nodes. Stage III indicates lymph nodeinvolvement, whether the cancer has spread to nearbyorgans or not. Stage IV A pancreatic cancer has spread toorgans near the pancreas such as the stomach, spleen, orcolon. Stage IVB is a cancer that has spread to distantsites (liver, lung). If pancreatic cancer has been treatedwith success and then appears again in the pancreas or inother organs, it is referred to as recurrent disease.\\nTreatment of pancreatic cancer will depend on sev-\\neral factors, including the stage of the disease and thepatient’s age and overall health status. A combination oftherapies is often employed in the treatment of this dis-ease to improve the patient’s chances for survival.Surgery is used whenever possible and is the only meansby which cancer of the pancreas can be cured. However,less than 15% of pancreatic tumors can be removed bysurgery. By the time the disease is diagnosed (usually atstage III), therapies such as radiation and chemotherapyor both are used in addition to surgery to relieve apatient’s symptoms and enhance quality of life. Forpatients with metastatic disease, chemotherapy and radi-ation are used mainly as palliative (pain alleviating)treatments.\\nSurgery\\nThree types of surgery are used in the treatment of\\npancreatic cancer, depending on what section of thepancreas the tumor is located in. A Whipple procedureremoves the head of the pancreas, part of the smallintestine and some of the surrounding tissues. This pro-cedure is most common since the majority of pancreat-ic cancers occur in the head of the organ. A total pan-createctomy removes the entire pancreas and theorgans around it. Distal pancreatectomy removes onlythe body and tail of the pancreas. Chemotherapy andradiation may precede surgery (neoadjuvant therapy)or follow surgery (adjuvant therapy). Surgery is alsoused to relieve symptoms of pancreatic cancer bydraining fluids or bypassing obstructions. Side effectsfrom surgery can include pain, weakness, fatigue, anddigestive problems. Some patients may develop dia-betes or malabsorption as a result of partial or totalremoval of the pancreas.Radiation therapy\\nRadiation therapy is sometimes used to shrink a\\ntumor before surgery or to remove remaining cancer cellsafter surgery. Radiation may also be used to relieve painor digestive problems caused by the tumor if it cannot beremoved by surgery. External radiation therapy refers toradiation applied externally to the abdomen using a beamof high-energy x rays. High-dose intraoperative radiationtherapy is sometimes used during surgery on tumors thathave spread to nearby organs. Internal radiation therapyrefers to the use of small radioactive seeds implanted inthe tumor tissue. The seeds emit radiation over a periodof time to kill tumor cells. Radiation treatment maycause side effects such as fatigue, tender or itchy skin,nausea, vomiting, and digestive problems.\\nChemotherapy\\nChemotherapeutic agents are powerful drugs that are\\nused to kill cancer cells. They are classified according tothe mechanism by which they induce cancer cell death.Multiple agents are often used to increase the chances oftumor cell death. Gemcitabine is the standard drug usedto treat pancreatic cancers and can be used alone or incombination with other drugs, such as 5-flourouracil (5-FU). Other drugs are being tested in combination withgemcitabine in several ongoing clinical trials, specifical-ly irinotecan (CPT-11) and oxaliplatin. Chemotherapymay be administered orally or intravenously in a series ofdoses over several weeks. During treatment, patients mayexperience fatigue, nausea, vomiting, hair loss, andmouth sores, depending on which drugs are used.\\nBiological treatments\\nNumerous vaccine treatments are being developed in\\nan effort to stimulate the body’s immune system intoattacking cancer cells. This is also referred to asimmunotherapy. Another type of biological treatmentinvolves using a targeted monoclonal antibody to inhibitthe growth of cancer cells. The antibody is thought tobind to and neutralize a protein that contributes to thegrowth of the cancer cells. Investigational treatments suchas these may be considered by patients with metastaticdisease who would like to participate in a clinical trial.Biological treatments typically cause flu-like symptoms(chills, fever, loss of appetite) during the treatment period.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAcupuncture or hypnotherapy may be used in addi-\\ntion to standard therapies to help relieve the pain associ-ated with pancreatic cancer. Because of the poor progno-sis associated with pancreatic cancer, some patients may\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2476Pancreatic cancer, exocrine'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 183}, page_content='try special diets with vitamin supplements, certain exer-\\ncise programs, or unconventional treatments not yetapproved by the FDA. Patients should always informtheir doctors of any alternative treatments they are usingas they could interfere with standard therapies. As of theyear 2000, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is fundingphase III clinical trials of a controversial treatment forpancreatic cancer that involves the use of supplementalpancreatic enzymes (to digest cancerous cells) and coffeeenemas (to stimulate the liver to detoxify the cancer).These theories remain unproven and the study is widelycriticized in the medical community. It remains to beenseen whether this method of treatment has any advantageover the standard chemotherapeutic regimen in prolong-ing patient survival or improving quality of life.\\nPrognosis\\nUnfortunately, cancer of the pancreas is often fatal,\\nand median survival from diagnosis is less than six months,while the five-year survival rate is 4%. This is mainly dueto the lack of screening methods available for early detec-tion of the disease. Yet, even when localized tumors can beremoved by surgery, patient survival after five years is only10% to 15%. These statistics demonstrate the aggressivenature of most pancreatic cancers and their tendency torecur. Pancreatic cancers tend to be resistant to radiationand chemotherapy and these modes of treatment are mainlyused to relieve pain and tumor burden.\\nPrevention\\nAlthough the exact cause of pancreatic cancer is not\\nknown, there are certain risk factors that may increase aperson’s chances of developing the disease. Quitting smok-ing will certainly reduce the risk for pancreatic cancer andmany other cancers. The American Cancer Society recom-mends a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and dietary fiber inorder to reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer. According tothe NCI, workers who are exposed to petroleum and otherchemicals may be at greater risk for developing the diseaseand should follow their employer’s safety precautions. Peo-ple with a family history of pancreatic cancer are at greaterrisk than the general population, as a small percentage ofpancreatic cancers are considered hereditary.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBeger, Hans G., et al., ed.

Pancreatitis can beacute (beginning suddenly, usually with the patientrecovering fully) or chronic (progressing slowly withcontinued, permanent injury to the pancreas).\\nDescription\\nThe pancreas is located in the midline of the back of\\nthe abdomen, closely associated with the liver, stomach,and duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). The\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2477Pancreatitis'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 184}, page_content='pancreas is considered a gland. A gland is an organ\\nwhose primary function is to produce chemicals that passeither into the main blood circulation (called anendocrine function), or pass into another organ (called anexocrine function). The pancreas is unusual because ithas both endocrine and exocrine functions. Its endocrinefunction produces three hormones. Two of these hor-mones, insulin and glucagon, are central to the process-ing of sugars in the diet (carbohydrate metabolism orbreakdown). The third hormone produced by theendocrine cells of the pancreas affects gastrointestinalfunctioning. This hormone is called vasoactive intestinalpolypeptide (VIP). The pancreas’ exocrine function pro-duces a variety of digestive enzymes (trypsin, chy-motrypsin, lipase, and amylase, among others). Theseenzymes are passed into the duodenum through a chan-nel called the pancreatic duct. In the duodenum, theenzymes begin the process of breaking down a variety offood components, including, proteins, fats, and starches.\\nAcute pancreatitis occurs when the pancreas sud-\\ndenly becomes inflamed but improves. Patients recoverfully from the disease, and in almost 90% of cases thesymptoms disappear within about a week after treatment.The pancreas returns to its normal architecture and func-tioning after healing from the illness. After an attack ofacute pancreatitis, tissue and cells of the pancreas returnto normal. With chronic pancreatitis, damage to the pan-creas occurs slowly over time. Symptoms may be persis-tent or sporadic, but the condition does not disappear andthe pancreas is permanently impaired. Pancreatic tissueis damaged, and the tissue and cells function poorly.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are a number of causes of acute pancreatitis.\\nThe most common, however, are gallbladder disease andalcoholism . These two diseases are responsible for more\\nthan 80% of all hospitalizations for acute pancreatitis.Other factors in the development of pancreatitis include:\\n• certain drugs\\n• infections\\n• structural problems of the pancreatic duct and bile\\nducts (channels leading from the gallbladder to the duo-denum)\\n• injury to the abdomen resulting in injury to the pan-\\ncreas (including injuries occurring during surgery)\\n• abnormally high levels of circulating fats in the blood-\\nstream\\n• malfunction of the parathyroid gland, with high blood\\nlevels of calcium\\n• complications from kidney transplants• a hereditary tendency toward pancreatitis\\nPancreatitis caused by drugs accounts for about 5%\\nof all cases. Some drugs that are definitely related to pan-creatitis include:\\n• azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine (Imuran)\\n• dideoxyinosine (Videx)\\n• estrogens (birth control pills)• furosemide (Lasix)• pentamidine (NebuPent)\\n• sulfonamides (Urobak, Azulfidine)\\n• tetracycline• thiazide diuretics (Diuril, Enduron)\\n• valproic acid (Depakote)\\nSome drugs that are probably related to pancreatitis\\ninclude:\\n• acetaminophen (Tylenol)• angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (Cap-\\noten, Vasotec)\\n• erythromycin• methyldopa (Aldomet)\\n• metronidazole (Flagyl, Protostat)\\n• nitrofurantoin (Furadantin, Furan)• nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Aleve,\\nNaprosyn, Motrin)\\n• salicylates (aspirin)\\nAll of these causes of pancreatitis seem to have a\\nsimilar mechanism in common. Under normal circum-stances, many of the extremely potent enzymes producedby the pancreas are not active until they are passed intothe duodenum, where contact with certain other chemi-cals allow them to function. In pancreatitis, somethingallows these enzymes to become prematurely activated,so that they actually begin their digestive functions with-in the pancreas. The pancreas, in essence, begins digest-ing itself. A cycle of inflammation begins, includingswelling and loss of function. Digestion of the blood ves-sels in the pancreas results in bleeding. Other active pan-creatic chemicals cause blood vessels to become leaky,and fluid begins leaking out of the normal circulationinto the abdominal cavity. The activated enzymes alsogain access to the bloodstream through leaky, erodedblood vessels, and begin circulating throughout the body.\\nPain is a major symptom in pancreatitis. The pain is\\nusually quite intense and steady, located in the upperright hand corner of the abdomen, and often described as“boring.” This pain is also often felt all the way throughto the patient’s back. The patient’s breathing may\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2478Pancreatitis'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 185}, page_content='become quite shallow because deeper breathing tends to\\ncause more pain. Relief of pain by sitting up and bendingforward is characteristic of pancreatic pain. Nausea and\\nvomiting , and abdominal swelling are all common as\\nwell. A patient will often have a slight fever , with an\\nincreased heart rate and low blood pressure.\\nClassic signs of shock may appear in more severely\\nill patients. Shock is a very serious syndrome that occurswhen the volume (quantity) of fluid in the blood is verylow. In shock, a patient’s arms and legs become extreme-ly cold, the blood pressure drops dangerously low, theheart rate is quite fast, and the patient may begin to expe-rience changes in mental status.\\nIn very severe cases of pancreatitis (called necrotiz-\\ning pancreatitis), the pancreatic tissue begins to die, andbleeding increases. Due to the bleeding into theabdomen, two distinctive signs may be noted in patientswith necrotizing pancreatitis. Turner’s sign is a reddish-purple or greenish-brown color to the flank area (the areabetween the ribs and the hip bone). Cullen’s sign is abluish color around the navel.\\nSome of the complications of pancreatitis are due to\\nshock. When shock occurs, all of the body’s major organsare deprived of blood (and, therefore, oxygen), resulting indamage. Kidney, respiratory, and heart failure are serious\\nrisks of shock. The pancreatic enzymes that have beguncirculating throughout the body (as well as various poisonscreated by the abnormal digestion of the pancreas by thoseenzymes) have severe effects on the major body systems.Any number of complications can occur, including dam-age to the heart, lungs, kidneys, lining of the gastrointesti-nal tract, liver, eyes, bones, and skin. As the pancreaticenzymes work on blood vessels surrounding the pancreas,and even blood vessels located at a distance, the risk ofblood clots increases. These blood clots complicate the sit-uation by blocking blood flow in the vessels. When bloodflow is blocked, the supply of oxygen is decreased to vari-ous organs and the organ can be damaged.\\nThe pancreas may develop additional problems,\\neven after the pancreatitis decreases. When the entireorgan becomes swollen and suffers extensive cell death(pancreatic necrosis), the pancreas becomes extremelysusceptible to serious infection. A local collection of pus(called a pancreatic abscess ) may develop several weeks\\nafter the illness subsides, and may result in increasedfever and a return of pain. Another late complication ofpancreatitis, occurring several weeks after the illnessbegins, is called a pancreatic pseudocyst. This occurswhen dead pancreatic tissue, blood, white blood cells,enzymes, and fluid leaked from the circulatory systemaccumulate. In an attempt to enclose and organize thisabnormal accumulation, a kind of wall forms from thedead tissue and the growing scar tissue in the area.\\nPseudocysts cause additional abdominal pain by puttingpressure on and displacing pancreatic tissue (resulting inmore pancreatic damage). Pseudocysts also press onother nearby structures in the gastrointestinal tract, caus-ing more disruption of function. Pseudocysts are life-threatening when they become infected (abscess) andwhen they rupture. Simple rupture of a pseudocyst caus-es death 14% of the time. Rupture complicated by bleed-ing causes death 60% of the time.\\nAs the pancreatic tissue is increasingly destroyed in\\nchronic pancreatitis, many digestive functions becomedisturbed. The quantity of hormones and enzymes nor-mally produced by the pancreas begins to seriouslydecrease. Decreases in the production of enzymes resultin the inability to appropriately digest food. Fat diges-tion, in particular, is impaired. A patient’s stools becomegreasy as fats are passed out of the body. The inability todigest and use proteins results in smaller muscles (wast-ing) and weakness. The inability to digest and use thenutrients in food leads to malnutrition , and a generally\\nweakened condition. As the disease progresses, perma-nent injury to the pancreas can lead to diabetes.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of pancreatitis can be made very early in\\nthe disease by noting high levels of pancreatic enzymescirculating in the blood (amylase and lipase). Later in thedisease, and in chronic pancreatitis, these enzyme levelswill no longer be elevated. Because of this fact, andbecause increased amylase and lipase can also occur inother diseases, the discovery of such elevations are help-ful but not mandatory in the diagnosis of pancreatitis.Other abnormalities in the blood may also point to pan-creatitis, including increased white blood cells (occur-ring with inflammation and/or infection), changes due todehydration from fluid loss, and abnormalities in the\\nblood concentration of calcium, magnesium, sodium,potassium, bicarbonate, and sugars.\\nX rays or ultrasound examination of the abdomen\\nmay reveal gallstones , perhaps responsible for blocking\\nthe pancreatic duct. The gastrointestinal tract will showsigns of inactivity ( ileus ) due to the presence of pancre-\\natitis. Chest x rays may reveal abnormalities due to airtrapping from shallow breathing, or due to lung compli-cations from the circulating pancreatic enzyme irritants.Computed tomography scans (CT scans) of the\\nabdomen may reveal the inflammation and fluid accumu-lation of pancreatitis, and may also be useful when com-plications like an abscess or a pseudocyst are suspected.\\nIn the case of chronic pancreatitis, a number of\\nblood tests will reveal the loss of pancreatic function that\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2479Pancreatitis'),\n",

Blood sugar (glucose) levels will rise,\\neventually reaching the levels present in diabetes. Thelevels of various pancreatic enzymes will fall, as theorgan is increasingly destroyed and replaced by non-functioning scar tissue. Calcification of the pancreas canalso be seen on x rays. Endoscopic retrograde cholan-\\ngiopancreatography (ERCP) may be used to diagnose\\nchronic pancreatitis in severe cases. In this procedure,the doctor uses a medical instrument fitted with a fiber-optic camera to inspect the pancreas. A magnified imageof the area is shown on a television screen viewed by thedoctor. Many endoscopes also allow the doctor toretrieve a small sample (biopsy) of pancreatic tissue toexamine under a microscope. A contrast product mayalso be used for radiographic examination of the area.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of pancreatitis involves quickly and suffi-\\nciently replacing lost fluids by giving the patient new flu-ids through a needle inserted in a vein (intravenous or IVfluids). These IV solutions need to contain appropriateamounts of salts, sugars, and sometimes even proteins, inorder to correct the patient’s disturbances in blood chem-istry. Pain is treated with a variety of medications. Inorder to decrease pancreatic function (and decrease thedischarge of more potentially harmful enzymes into thebloodstream), the patient is not allowed to eat.

Thenasogastric tube can empty the stomach of fluid and air,which may accumulate due to the inactivity of the gas-trointestinal tract.

Infections (oftenoccurring in cases of necrotizing pancreatitis, abscesses,and pseudocysts) will require antibiotics through the IV .\\nSevere necrotizing pancreatitis may require surgery toremove part of the dying pancreas. A pancreatic abscesscan be drained by a needle inserted through the abdomenand into the collection of pus (percutaneous needle aspi-ration). If this is not sufficient, an abscess may alsorequire surgical removal. Pancreatic pseudocysts mayshrink on their own (in 25–40% of cases) or may continueto expand, requiring needle aspiration or surgery. Whendiagnostic exams reveal the presence of gallstones,surgery may be necessary for their removal. When apatient is extremely ill from pancreatitis, however, suchsurgery may need to be delayed until any infection istreated, and the patient’s condition stabilizes.\\nBecause chronic pancreatitis often includes repeated\\nflares of acute pancreatitis, the same kinds of basic treat-ment are necessary.

As chronic pancreatitis continues and insulinlevels drop, a patient may require insulin injections inorder to be able to process sugars in his or her diet. Pan-creatic enzymes can be replaced with oral medicines, andpatients sometimes have to take as many as eight pillswith each meal. As the pancreas is progressivelydestroyed, some patients stop feeling the abdominal painthat was initially so severe. Others continue to have con-stant abdominal pain, and may even require a surgicalprocedure for relief. Drugs can be used to reduce thepain, but when narcotics are used for pain relief there isdanger of the patient becoming addicted.\\nPrognosis\\nA number of systems have been developed to help\\ndetermine the prognosis of an individual with pancreati-tis. A very basic evaluation of a patient will allow someprediction to be made based on the presence of dying pan-creatic tissue (necrosis) and bleeding. When necrosis andbleeding are present, as many as 50% of patients may die.\\nMore elaborate systems have been created to help\\ndetermine the prognosis of patients with pancreatitis. Themost commonly used system identifies 11 different signs(Ranson’s signs) that can be used to determine the severi-ty of the disease. The first five categories are evaluatedwhen the patient is admitted to the hospital:\\n• age over 55 years\\n• blood sugar level over 200 mg/Dl\\n• serum lactic dehydrogenase over 350 IU/L (increased\\nwith increased breakdown of blood, as would occurwith internal bleeding, and with heart or liver damage)\\n• AST over 250 µ (a measure of liver function, as well as\\na gauge of damage to the heart, muscle, brain, and kid-ney)\\n• white blood count over 16,000 µL\\nThe next six of Ranson’s signs are reviewed 48\\nhours after admission to the hospital. These are:\\n• greater than 10% decrease in hematocrit (a measure of\\nred blood cell volume)\\n• increase in BUN greater than 5 mg/dL (blood urea\\nnitrogen, an indicator of kidney function)\\n• blood calcium less than 8 mg/dL• PaO2 less than 60 mm Hg (a measure of oxygen in the\\nblood)\\n• base deficit greater than 4 mEg/L (a measure of change\\nin the normal acidity of the blood)• fluid sequestration greater than 6 L (an estimation of\\nthe quantity of fluid that has leaked out of the blood cir-culation and into other body spaces)\\nOnce a doctor determines how many of Ranson’s\\nsigns are present and gives the patient a score, the doctorcan better predict the risk of death. The more signs pre-sent, the greater the chance of fatal complications. Apatient with less than three positive Ranson’s signs has a95% survival rate. A patient with three to four positiveRanson’s signs has a 80-85% survival rate.\\nThe results of a CT scan can also be used to predict\\nthe severity of pancreatitis. Slight swelling of the pancreasindicates mild illness. Significant swelling, especially withevidence of destruction of the pancreas and/or fluid build-up in the abdominal cavity, indicates more severe illness.With severe illness, there is a worse prognosis.\\nPrevention\\nAlcoholism is essentially the only preventable cause\\nof pancreatitis. Patients with chronic pancreatitis muststop drinking alcohol entirely. The drugs that cause ormay cause pancreatitis should also be avoided.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nGreenberger, Norton J., Phillip P.

A per-son with panic disorder may have repeated panic attacks(at least several a month) and feel severe anxiety abouthaving another attack.\\nDescription\\nEach year, panic disorder affects one out of 63\\nAmericans. While many people experience moments ofanxiety, panic attacks are sudden and unprovoked, hav-ing little to do with real danger.\\nPanic disorder is a chronic, debilitating condition\\nthat can have a devastating impact on a person’s family,work, and social life. Typically, the first attack strikeswithout warning. A person might be walking down thestreet, driving a car, or riding an escalator when suddenlypanic strikes. Pounding heart, sweating palms, and anoverwhelming feeling of impending doom are commonfeatures. While the attack may last only seconds or min-utes, the experience can be profoundly disturbing. A per-son who has had one panic attack typically worries thatanother one may occur at any time.\\nAs the fear of future panic attacks deepens, the per-\\nson begins to avoid situations in which panic occurred inthe past. In severe cases of panic disorder, the victimrefuses to leave the house for fear of having a panicattack. This fear of being in exposed places is oftencalled agoraphobia .\\nPeople with untreated panic disorder may have prob-\\nlems getting to work or staying on the job. As the person’sworld narrows, untreated panic disorder can lead todepression, substance abuse, and in rare instances, suicide.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nScientists are not sure what causes panic disorder,\\nbut they suspect the tendency to develop the conditioncan be inherited. Some experts think that people withpanic disorder may have a hypersensitive nervous systemthat unnecessarily responds to nonexistent threats.Research suggests that people with panic disorder maynot be able to make proper use of their body’s normalstress-reducing chemicals.People with panic disorder usually have their first\\npanic attack in their 20s. Four or more of the followingsymptoms during panic attacks would indicate panic dis-order if no medical, drug-related, neurologic, or otherpsychiatric disorder is found:\\n• pounding, skipping or palpitating heartbeat• shortness of breath or the sensation of smothering• dizziness or lightheadedness• nausea or stomach problems• chest pains or pressure• choking sensation or a “lump in the throat”\\n• chills or hot flashes\\n• sweating• fear of dying• feelings of unreality or being detached• tingling or numbness• shaking and trembling• fear of losing control or going crazy\\nA panic attack is often accompanied by the urge to\\nescape, together with a feeling of certainty that death is\\nimminent. Others are convinced they are about to have aheart attack , suffocate, lose control, or “go crazy.” Once\\npeople experience a panic attack, they tend to worry somuch about having another attack that they avoid theplace or situation associated with the original episode.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause its physical symptoms are easily confused\\nwith other conditions, panic disorder often goes undiag-nosed. A thorough physical examination is needed to\\nrule out a medical condition. Because the physical symp-toms are so pronounced and frightening, panic attackscan be mistaken for a heart problem. Some people expe-riencing a panic attack go to an emergency room andendure batteries of tests until a diagnosis is made.\\nOnce a medical condition is ruled out, a mental\\nhealth professional is the best person to diagnose panicattack and panic disorder, taking into account not just theactual episodes, but how the patient feels about theattacks, and how they affect everyday life.\\nMost health insurance policies include some limited\\namount of mental health coverage, although few com-pletely cover outpatient mental health care.\\nTreatment\\nMost patients with panic disorder respond best to a\\ncombination of cognitive-behavioral therapy and med-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2482Panic disorder'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 189}, page_content='ication. Cognitive-behavioral therapy usually runs from\\n12–15 sessions. It teaches patients:\\n• how to identify and alter thought patterns so as not to\\nmisconstrue bodily sensations, events, or situations ascatastrophic,\\n• how to prepare for the situations and physical symp-\\ntoms that trigger a panic attack,\\n• how to identify and change unrealistic self-talk (such as\\n“I’m going to die!”) that can worsen a panic attack,\\n• how to calm down and learn breathing exercises to\\ncounteract the physical symptoms of panic,\\n• how to gradually confront the frightening situation step\\nby step until it becomes less terrifying,\\n• how to “desensitize” themselves to their own physical\\nsensations, such as rapid heart rate.\\nAt the same time, many people find that medications\\ncan help reduce or prevent panic attacks by changing theway certain chemicals interact in the brain. People withpanic disorder usually notice whether or not the drug iseffective within two months, but most people take med-ication for at least six months to a year.\\nSeveral kinds of drugs can reduce or prevent panic\\nattacks, including:\\n• selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antipres-\\nsants like paroxetine (Paxil) or fluoxetine (Prozac), areapproved specifically for the treatment of panic,\\n• tricyclic antidepressants such as clomipramine (Ana-\\nfranil),\\n•benzodiazepines such as alprazolam (Xanax) and clon-\\nazepam (Klonopin)\\nFinally, patients can make certain lifestyle changes\\nto help keep panic at bay, such as eliminating caffeine\\nand alcohol, cocaine , amphetamines, and marijuana.\\nAlternative treatment\\nOne approach used in several medical centers focus-\\nes on teaching patients how to accept their fear instead ofdreading it. In this method, the therapist repeatedly stim-ulates a person’s body sensations (such as a poundingheartbeat) that can trigger fear. Eventually, the patientgets used to these sensations and learns not to be afraidof them. Patients who respond report almost completeabsence of panic attacks.\\nA variety of other atlernative therapies may be help-\\nful in treating panic attacks. Neurolinguistic program-ming and hypnotherapy can be beneificial, since these\\ntechniques can help bring an awareness of the root causeof the attacks to the conscious mind. Herbal remedies,including lemon balm ( Melissa officinalis ), oat straw\\n(Avena sativa ), passionflower ( Passiflora incarnata ), and\\nskullcap ( Scutellaria lateriflora ), may help significantly\\nby strengthening the nervous system. Homeopathic med-icine, nutritional supplementation (especially with B vit-\\namins , magnesium, and antioxidant vitamins), creative\\nvisualization, guided imagery , and relaxation tech-\\nniques may help some people experiencing from panicattacks. Hydrotherapies, especially hot epsom salt bathsor baths with essential oil of lavender ( Lavandula offici-\\nnalis ), can help patients relax.\\nPrognosis\\nWhile there may be occasional periods of improve-\\nment, the episodes of panic rarely disappear on theirown. Fortunately, panic disorder responds very well totreatment; panic attacks decrease in up to 90% of peopleafter 6-8 weeks of a combination of cognitive-behavioraltherapy and medication.\\nUnfortunately, many people with panic disorder\\nnever get the help they need. If untreated, panic disordercan last for years and may become so severe that a nor-mal life is impossible. Many people who struggle withuntreated panic disorder and try to hide their symptomsend up losing their friends, family, and jobs.\\nPrevention\\nThere is no way to prevent the initial onset of panic\\nattacks. Antidepressant drugs or benzodiazepines can\\nprevent future panic attacks, especially when combinedwith cognitive-behavioral therapy. There is some sugges-tion that avoiding stimulants (including caffeine, alcohol,or over-the-counter cold medicines) may help preventattacks as well.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBassett, Lucinda.

Turkington\\nPap test\\nDefinition\\nThe Pap test is a procedure in which a physician\\nscrapes cells from the cervix or vagina to check for cer-\\nvical cancer , vaginal cancer, or abnormal changes that\\ncould lead to cancer .\\nPurpose\\nThe Pap test is used to detect abnormal growth of cer-\\nvical cells at an early stage so that treatment can be startedwhen the condition is easiest to treat. This microscopicanalysis of cells can detect cervical cancer, precancerouschanges, inflammation (vaginitis), infections, and somesexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The Pap test can\\noccasionally detect endometrial (uterine) cancer or ovari-\\nan cancer , although it was not designed for this purpose.\\nWomen should begin to have Pap tests at the age of\\n18 or whenever they become sexually active. Young peo-ple are more likely to have multiple sex partners, whichincreases their risk of certain diseases that can cause can-cer, such as human papillomavirus (HPV), but the Amer-ican Cancer Society suggests the test benefits women ofevery age. Doctors have varying opinions about howoften a woman should have a Pap test. The AmericanCancer Society states that after three consecutive nega-tive examinations, a doctor may decide that a womanwithout symptoms of gynecologic problems may beexamined less frequently, usually every three years.Many other doctors, however, recommend annual Paptests for all their patients.\\nWomen with certain risk factors should always have\\nyearly tests. Those at highest risk for cervical cancer are\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2484Pap test'),\n",

Women older than 40 should also have thetest yearly, especially in the event of bleeding aftermenopause . Women who have had a positive test result\\nin the past may need screening every six months. Womenwho have had cervical cancer or precancer should haveregular Pap smears.\\nOther women also benefit from the Pap test. Women\\nover age 65 account for 25% of all cases of cervical can-cer and 41% of deaths from this disease. Women overage 65 who have never had a Pap smear benefit the mostfrom a Pap smear. Even a woman who has had a hys-\\nterectomy (removal of the uterus) should continue to\\nhave regular Pap tests at the discretion of the woman andthe provider. If the surgery was for cancer, she may needto be examined more often than once a year. (Somewomen have the cervix left in place after hysterectomy.)Finally, a pregnant woman should have a Pap test as partof her first prenatal examination.\\nThe Pap test is a screening test. It identifies women\\nwho are at increased risk of cervical dysplasia (abnormalcells) or cervical cancer. Only an examination of thecervix with a special lighted instrument ( colposcopy )\\nand samples of cervical tissue (biopsies) can actuallydiagnose these problems.\\nPrecautions\\nThe Pap test is usually not done during the menstru-\\nal period because of the presence of blood cells. The besttime is in the middle of the menstrual cycle.\\nDescription\\nThe Pap test is an extremely cost-effective and bene-\\nficial test. Cervical cancer used to be a leading cause ofcancer deaths in American women, but widespread use ofthis diagnostic procedure reduced the death rate from thisdisease by 74% between 1955 and 1992. The Pap testdetects about 95% of cervical cancer.\\nThe Pap test, sometimes called a cervical smear, is\\nthe microscopic examination of cells scraped from boththe outer cervix and the cervical canal. (The cervix is theopening between the vagina and the uterus, or womb.) Itis called the “Pap” test after its developer, Dr. George N.Papanicolaou. This simple procedure is performed dur-ing a gynecologic examination and is usually covered byinsurance. For those with coverage, Medicare will payfor one screening Pap smear every three years.During the pelvic examination, an instrument called a\\nspeculum is inserted into the vagina to open it. The doctorthen uses a tiny brush, or a cotton-tipped swab and a smallspatula to wipe loose cells off the cervix and to scrapethem from the inside of the cervix. The cells are trans-ferred or “smeared” onto glass slides, the slides are treatedto stabilize the cells, and the slides are sent to a laboratoryfor microscopic examination. The entire procedure is usu-ally painless and takes five to 10 minutes at most.\\nPreparation\\nThe Pap test may show abnormal results when a\\nwoman is healthy or normal results in women with cervicalabnormalities as much as 25% of the time. It may even missup to 5% of cervical cancers. Some simple preparationsmay help to ensure that the results are reliable. Among themeasures that may help increase test reliability are:\\n• avoiding sexual intercourse for two days before the test• not using douches for two or three days before the test• avoid use of tampons, vaginal creams, or birth control\\nfoams or jellies for two to three days before the test\\n• scheduling the Pap smear when not menstruating\\nHowever, most women are not routinely advised to\\nmake any special preparations for a Pap test.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2485Pap test\\nUterusVagina\\nCervixSpeculumSpatula\\nThe Pap test is a procedure used to detect abnormal growth\\nof cervical cells which may be a precursor to cancer of thecervix. It is administered by a physician who inserts a specu-lum into the vagina to open and separate the vaginal walls.

The physi-cian should be confident in the accuracy of the chosen lab.\\nBefore the exam, the physician will take a complete\\nsexual history to determine a woman’s risk status for cer-vical cancer. Questions may include date and results ofthe last Pap test, any history of abnormal Pap tests, dateof last menstrual period and any irregularity, use of hor-mones and birth control, family history of gynecologicdisorders, and any vaginal symptoms. These topics arerelevant to the interpretation of the Pap test, especially ifany abnormalities are detected. Immediately before thePap test, the woman should empty her bladder to avoiddiscomfort during the procedure.\\nAftercare\\nHarmless cervical bleeding is possible immediately\\nafter the test; a woman may need to use a sanitary nap-kin. She should also be sure to comply with her doctor’sorders for follow-up visits.\\nRisks\\nNo appreciable health risks are associated with the\\nPap test. However, abnormal results (whether valid ordue to technical error) can cause significant anxiety .\\nWomen may wish to have their sample double-checked,either by the same laboratory or by the new technique ofcomputer-assisted rescreening. The Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) has approved the use of AutoPapand PAPNET to doublecheck samples that have beenexamined by technologists. AutoPap may also be used toperform initial screening of slides, which are thenchecked by a technologist. Any abnormal Pap test shouldbe followed by colposcopy and not by double checking\\nthe pap test.\\nNormal results\\nNormal (negative) results from the laboratory exam\\nmean that no atypical, dysplastic, or cancer cells weredetected, and the cervix is normal.\\nAbnormal results\\nTerminology\\nAbnormal cells found on the Pap test may be\\ndescribed using two different grading systems. Althoughthis can be confusing, the systems are quite similar. TheBethesda system is based on the term squamous intraep-ithelial lesion (SIL). Precancerous cells are classified asatypical squamous cells of undetermined significance(ASCUS), low-grade SIL, or high-grade SIL. Low-gradeSIL includes mild dysplasia (abnormal cell growth) andabnormalities caused by HPV; high-grade SIL includesmoderate or severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ (can-cer that has not spread beyond the cervix).\\nAnother term that may be used is “cervical intraep-\\nithelial neoplasia” (CIN). In this classification system,mild dysplasia is called CIN I, moderate is CIN II, andsevere dysplasia or carcinoma in situ is CIN III.\\nRegardless of terminology, it is important to remem-\\nber that an abnormal (positive) result does not necessari-ly indicate cancer. Results may be falsely abnormal afterinfection or irritation of the cervix. Up to 40% of milddysplasia reverts to normal tissue without treatment, andonly 1% of mild abnormalities ever develop into cancer.\\nChanges of unknown cause\\nASCUS or LSIL cells are found in 5–10% of all Pap\\ntests. The most common abnormality is atypical squa-mous cells of undetermined significance, which arefound in 4% of all Pap tests. Sometimes these results aredescribed further as either reactive or precancerous.Reactive changes suggest that the cervical cells areresponding to inflammation, such as from a yeast infec-tion. These women may be treated for infection and thenundergo repeat Pap testing in three to six months. If thoseresults are negative, no further treatment is necessary.This category may also include atypical “glandular”cells, which could imply a more severe type of cancerand requires repeat testing and further evaluation.\\nDysplasia\\nThe next most common finding (in about 25 of every\\n1,000 tests) is low-grade SIL, which includes mild dys-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2486Pap test\\nThese malignant cells were taken from a woman’s cervix\\nduring a Pap test.

Unlike can-\\ncer cells, these cells do not invade normal tissues.Women are most susceptible to cervical dysplasiabetween the ages of 25 and 35. Typically, dysplasia caus-es no symptoms, although women may experienceabnormal vaginal bleeding. Because dysplasia is precan-cerous, it should be treated if it is moderate or severe.\\nTreatment of dysplasia depends on the degree of\\nabnormality. In women with no other risk factors for cer-vical cancer, mild precancerous changes may be simplyobserved over time with repeat testing, perhaps everyfour to six months. This strategy works only if womenare diligent about keeping later appointments. Premalig-nant cells may remain that way without causing cancerfor five to ten years, and may never become malignant.\\nIn women with positive results or risk factors, the\\ngynecologist must perform colposcopy and biopsy. A col-poscope is an instrument that looks like binoculars, with alight and a magnifier, used to view the cervix. Biopsy, orremoval of a small piece of abnormal cervical or vaginaltissue for analysis, is usually done at the same time.\\nHigh-grade SIL (found in three of every 50 Pap tests)\\nincludes moderate to severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ(CIN II or III). After confirmation by colposcopy and biop-sy, it must be removed or destroyed to prevent furthergrowth. Several outpatient techniques are available: coniza-tion (removal of a cone-shaped piece of tissue), laser\\nsurgery ,cryotherapy (freezing), or the “loop electrosurgi-\\ncal excision procedure.” Cure rates are nearly 100% afterprompt and appropriate treatment of carcinoma in situ. Ofcourse, frequent checkups are then necessary.\\nCancer\\nHPV , the most common STD in the United States,\\nmay be responsible for many cervical cancers. Cancermay be manifested by unusual vaginal bleeding or dis-charge, bowel and bladder problems, and pain . Women\\nare at greatest risk of developing cervical cancer betweenthe ages of 30 and 40 and between the ages of 50 and 60.Most new cancers are diagnosed in women between 50and 55. Although the likelihood of developing this diseasebegins to level off for Caucasian women at the age of 45,it increases steadily for African-Americans for another 40years. Biopsy is indicated when any abnormal growth isfound on the cervix, even if the Pap test is negative.\\nDoctors have traditionally used radiation therapy\\nand surgery to treat cervical cancer that has spread withinthe cervix or throughout the pelvis. In severe cases, post-operative radiation is administered to kill any remainingcancer cells, and chemotherapy may be used if cancer\\nhas spread to other organs.

Swelling of the optic nerve due to other causessuch as infection or inflammatory disease is not calledpapilledema.\\nDescription\\nThe optic nerve is the nerve that transmits signals\\nfrom the eye to the brain. Papilledema is a swelling ofthis nerve where it meets the eye (the optic disc) causedby an increase in intracranial pressure. Almost all casesof papilledema are bilateral (affect both eyes). Papillede-ma can be observed in people of any age, but is relativelyuncommon in infants because the bones of the skull arenot fully fused together at this age.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPapilledema is caused by an increase in the pressure\\nof the fluid (cerebrospinal fluid) that is present betweenthe brain and the skull, inside the head. This increase inintracranial pressure may be caused by any of a varietyof conditions within the skull, brain, or spinal cord. Themost common causes of papilledema are:• tumor of the brain, spinal cord, skull, spinal column, or\\noptic nerve\\n• abscess (the accumulation of pus within a confined\\nspace)\\n• craniosynostosis (an abnormal closure of the bones of\\nthe skull)\\n• hemorrhage (bleeding)\\n• hydrocephalus (an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid\\nwithin the skull)\\n• intracranial infection (any infection within the skull\\nsuch as meningitis and encephalitis)\\n• head injury\\nThe symptoms of papilledema include:\\n• headaches, which are usually worse upon awakening\\nand exacerbated by coughing, holding the breath, orother maneuvers that tend to increase intracranial pres-sure\\n• nausea and vomiting\\n• changes in vision, such as temporary and transient blur-\\nring, graying, flickering, or double vision\\nDiagnosis\\nA diagnosis of papilledema is achieved by visual\\nexamination of the eye with an ophthalmoscope. Thisinstrument shines light through the pupil of the eye andilluminates the retina while the clinician looks through it.Eye drops to dilate the pupils are used to insure a thor-ough examination.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of papilledema is generally aimed at the\\ntreatment of the underlying disorder that is causingpapilledema.\\nDiuretic drugs combined with a weight reduction\\nprogram may be useful in cases of papilledema that arecaused by an abnormally high production of cere-brospinal fluid.\\nCorticosteroids have been shown to be effective in\\nrelieving the symptoms in some patients with papillede-ma caused by inflammatory disorders.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments for conditions that cause the\\noccurrence of papilledema include acupuncture ,aro-\\nmatherapy ,hydrotherapy , massage, and herbal reme-\\ndies.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2488Papilledema'),\n",

The other is to relieve pressure.\\nLiquid that accumulates in the abdomen is called\\nascites . Ascites seeps out of organs for several reasons\\nrelated either to disease in the organ or fluid pressuresthat are changing.\\nLiver disease\\nAll the blood flowing through the intestines passes\\nthrough the liver on its way back to the heart. When pro-gressive disease such as alcohol damage or hepatitisdestroys enough liver tissue, the scarring that resultsshrinks the liver and constricts the blood flow. Such scar-ring of the liver is called cirrhosis . Pressure builds up in\\nthe intestinal circulation, slowing flow and pushing fluidinto the tissues. Slowly the fluid accumulates in areaswith the lowest pressure and greatest capacity. The freespace around abdominal organs receives most of it. Thisspace is called the peritoneal space because it is enclosedby a thin membrane called the peritoneum. The peri-toneum wraps around nearly every organ in the abdomen,providing many folds and spaces for the fluid to gather.\\nInfections\\nPeritonitis is an infection of the peritoneum. Infec-\\ntion changes the dynamics of body fluids, causing themto seep into tissues and spaces. Peritonitis can develop inseveral ways. Many abdominal organs contain germs thatdo not belong elsewhere in the body. If they spill theircontents into the peritoneum, infection is the result. Thegall bladder, the stomach, any part of the intestine, andmost especially the appendix—all cause peritonitis whenthey leak or rupture. Tuberculosis can infect many\\norgans in the body; it is not confined to the lungs. Tuber-culous peritonitis causes ascites.\\nOther inflammations\\nPeritoneal fluid is not just produced by infections.\\nThe pancreas can cause a massive sterile peritonitis whenit leaks its digestive enzymes into the abdomen.\\nCancer\\nAny cancer that begins in or spreads to the abdomen\\ncan leak fluid.

Nephrosis and nephrotic\\nsyndrome are the general terms for diseases that cause\\nthe kidneys to retain water and provoke its movementinto body tissues and spaces.\\nHeart failure\\nThe ultimate source of fluid pressure in the body is\\nthe heart, which generates blood pressure. All other pres-sures in the body are related to blood pressure. As theheart starts to fail, blood backs up waiting to be pumped.This increases back pressure upstream, particularlybelow the heart where gravity is also pulling blood awayfrom the heart. The extra fluid from heart failure is first\\nnoticed in the feet and ankles, where gravitational effectsare most potent. In the abdomen, the liver swells first,then it and other abdominal organs start to leak.\\nPleural fluid\\nThe other major body cavity is the chest. The tissue\\nin the chest corresponding to the peritoneum is called thepleura, and the space contained within the pleura,between the ribs and the lungs, is called the pleuralspace. Fluid is often found in both cavities, and fluidfrom one cavity can find its way into the other.\\nFluid that accumulates in the abdomen creates\\nabnormal pressures on organs in the abdomen. Digestionis hindered; blood flow is slowed. Pressure upward onthe chest compromises breathing. The kidneys functionpoorly in the presence of such external pressures andmay even fail with tense, massive ascites.\\nDescription\\nDuring paracentesis, special needles puncture the\\nabdominal wall, being careful not to hit internal organs. Iffluid is needed only for analysis, just a bit is removed. Ifpressure relief is an additional goal, many quarts may beremoved. Rapid removal of large amounts of fluid cancause blood pressure to drop suddenly. For this reason, thephysician will often leave a tube in place so that fluid canbe removed slowly, giving the circulation time to adapt.\\nA related procedure called culpocentesis removes\\nascitic fluid from the very bottom of the abdominal cavi-ty through the back of the vagina.

Normal muscle function requires intactconnections all along this motor pathway. Damage at anypoint reduces the brain’s ability to control the muscle’smovements. This reduced efficiency causes weakness,also called paresis. Complete loss of communication pre-vents any willed movement at all. This lack of control iscalled paralysis. Certain inherited abnormalities in mus-cle cause periodic paralysis , in which the weakness\\ncomes and goes.\\nThe line between weakness and paralysis is not\\nabsolute. A condition causing weakness may progress toparalysis. On the other hand, strength may be restored to aparalyzed limb. Nerve regeneration or regrowth is one wayin which strength can return to a paralyzed muscle. Paraly-sis almost always causes a change in muscle tone. Para-lyzed muscle may be flaccid, flabby, and without appre-ciable tone, or it may be spastic, tight, and with abnormal-ly high tone that increases when the muscle is moved.\\nParalysis may affect an individual muscle, but it usu-\\nally affects an entire body region. The distribution ofweakness is an important clue to the location of the nervedamage that is causing the paralysis. Words describingthe distribution of paralysis use the suffix “-plegia,” fromthe Greek word for “stroke.” The types of paralysis areclassified by region:\\n• monoplegia, affecting only one limb• diplegia, affecting the same body region on both sides\\nof the body (both arms, for example, or both sides ofthe face)\\n• hemiplegia, affecting one side of the body• paraplegia, affecting both legs and the trunk• quadriplegia, affecting all four limbs and the trunk\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe nerve damage that causes paralysis may be in\\nthe brain or spinal cord (the central nervous system) or itmay be in the nerves outside the spinal cord (the periph-eral nervous system). The most common causes of dam-age to the brain are:\\n•stroke\\n• tumor• trauma (caused by a fall or a blow)•multiple sclerosis (a disease that destroys the protec-\\ntive sheath covering nerve cells)•cerebral palsy (a condition caused by a defect or injury\\nto the brain that occurs at or shortly after birth)\\n• metabolic disorder (a disorder that interferes with the\\nbody’s ability to maintain itself)\\nDamage to the spinal cord is most often caused by\\ntrauma, such as a fall or a car crash. Other conditions thatmay damage nerves within or immediately adjacent tothe spine include:\\n• tumor• herniated disk (also called a ruptured or slipped disk)\\n• spondylosis (a disease that causes stiffness in the joints\\nof the spine)\\n• rheumatoid arthritis of the spine\\n• neurodegenerative disease (a disease that damages\\nnerve cells)\\n• multiple sclerosis\\nDamage to peripheral nerves may be caused by:\\n• trauma\\n• compression or entrapment (such as carpal tunnel syn-\\ndrome)\\n•Guillain-Barré syndrome (a disease of the nerves that\\nsometimes follows fever caused by a viral infection or\\nimmunization)\\n• chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneu-\\nropathy (CIDP) (a condition that causes pain and\\nswelling in the protective sheath covering nerve cells)\\n• radiation\\n• inherited demyelinating disease (a condition that\\ndestroys the protective sheath around the nerve cell)\\n• toxins or poisons\\nSymptoms\\nThe distribution of paralysis offers important clues\\nto the site of nerve damage. Hemiplegia is almost alwayscaused by brain damage on the side opposite the paraly-sis, often from a stroke. Paraplegia occurs after injury tothe lower spinal cord, and quadriplegia occurs after dam-age to the upper spinal cord at the level of the shouldersor higher (the nerves controlling the arms leave the spineat that level). Diplegia usually indicates brain damage,most often from cerebral palsy. Monoplegia may becaused by isolated damage to either the central or theperipheral nervous system.

Persecutorydelusions in paranoid schizophrenia are bizarre, some-times grandiose, and often accompanied by auditory hal-\\nlucinations . Delusions experienced by individuals with\\ndelusional disorder are more plausible than those experi-enced by paranoid schizophrenics; not bizarre, thoughstill unjustified. Individuals with delusional disorder mayseem offbeat or quirky rather than mentally ill, and, assuch, may never seek treatment.\\nPersons with paranoid personality disorder tend to\\nbe self-centered, self-important, defensive, and emo-tionally distant. Their paranoia manifests itself in con-stant suspicions rather than full-blown delusions. Thedisorder often impedes social and personal relation-ships and career advancement. Some individuals withPPD are described as “litigious,” as they are constantlyinitiating frivolous law suits. PPD is more common inmen than in women, and typically begins in earlyadulthood.Causes and symptoms\\nThe exact cause of paranoia is unknown. Potential\\ncausal factors may be genetics, neurological abnormali-ties, changes in brain chemistry, and stress . Paranoia is\\nalso a possible side effect of drug use and abuse (forexample, alcohol, marijuana, amphetamines, cocaine ,\\nPCP). Acute, or short term, paranoia may occur in someindividuals overwhelmed by stress.\\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\\nDisorders , fourth edition ( DSM-IV ), the diagnostic\\nstandard for mental health professionals in the UnitedStates, lists the following symptoms for paranoid per-sonality disorder:\\n• suspicious; unfounded suspicions; believes others are\\nplotting against him/her\\n• preoccupied with unsupported doubts about friends or\\nassociates\\n• reluctant to confide in others due to a fear that informa-\\ntion may be used against him/her\\n• reads negative meanings into innocuous remarks• bears grudges• perceives attacks on his/her reputation that are not clear\\nto others, and is quick to counterattack\\n• maintains unfounded suspicions regarding the fidelity\\nof a spouse or significant other\\nDiagnosis\\nPatients with paranoid symptoms should undergo a\\nthorough physical examination and patient history to\\nrule out possible organic causes (such as dementia) orenvironmental causes (such as extreme stress). If a psy-chological cause is suspected, a psychologist will con-duct an interview with the patient and may administerone of several clinical inventories, or tests, to evaluatemental status.\\nTreatment\\nParanoia that is symptomatic of paranoid schizo-\\nphrenia, delusional disorder, or paranoid personality dis-order should be treated by a psychologist and/or psychia-trist. Antipsychotic medication such as thioridazine(Mellaril), haloperidol (Haldol), chlorpromazine (Tho-razine), clozapine (Clozaril), or risperidone (Risperdal)may be prescribed, and cognitive therapy or psychothera-py may be employed to help the patient cope with theirparanoia and/or persecutory delusions.

PTH works together with vitaminD to maintain healthy bones. The parathyroid glands aresmall paired glands located near the thyroid gland at thebase of the neck.\\nPurpose\\nThe PTH level is measured to evaluate the level of\\nblood calcium. It is routinely monitored in patients witha kidney disorder called chronic renal failure (CRF).Because PTH is one of the major factors affecting calci-um metabolism, the PTH test helps to distinguish non-parathyroid from parathyroid causes of too much calci-um in the blood ( hypercalcemia ).\\nDifferential diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism\\nPTH is also useful in the differential diagnosis of\\noveractive parathyroid glands ( hyperparathyroidism ).\\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism is most often caused by abenign tumor in one or more of the parathyroid glands. Itis rarely caused by parathyroid cancer . Patients with this\\ncondition have high PTH and calcium levels.\\nSecondary hyperparathyroidism is often seen in\\npatients with chronic renal failure (CRF). The kidneysfail to excrete sufficient phosphate, and the parathyroidgland secretes PTH in an effort to lower calcium levels tobalance the calcium-phosphate ratio. Because of the con-stant stimulation of the parathyroid, CRF patients havehigh PTH and normal or slightly low calcium levels.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2494Parathyroid hormone test'),\n",

Patients with this condition have highPTH and high calcium levels.\\nSpecific PTH assays\\nPTH is broken down in the body into three different\\nmolecular forms: the intact PTH molecule and severalsmaller fragments which include an amino acid or N-ter-minal, a midregion or midmolecule, and a carboxyl orC-terminal. Two tests are currently used to measureintact PTH and its terminal fragments. While both testsare used to diagnose hyper-or hypoparathyroidism ,\\neach test also has specific applications as well. The C-terminal PTH assay is used to diagnose the ongoing dis-turbances in PTH metabolism that occur with secondaryand tertiary hyperparathyroidism. The assay for intactPTH and the N-terminal fragment, which are both mea-sured at the same time, is more accurate in detectingsudden changes in the PTH level. For this reason, the N-terminal PTH assay is used to monitor a patient’sresponse to therapy.\\nPrecautions\\nDrug interactions\\nSome prescription drugs affect the results of PTH\\ntests. Drugs that increase PTH levels include phosphates,\\nanticonvulsants, steroids, isoniazid, lithium, and rifampin.Drugs that decrease PTH include cimetidine and propra-\\nnolol.\\nTiming\\nPTH levels are subject to daily variation, ranging\\nfrom a peak around 2:00 \\nA.M. to a low point around 2:00\\nP.M. Specimens are usually drawn at 8:00 A.M. The labo-\\nratory should be notified if the patient works a night shiftso that this difference in biological rhythm can be takeninto account.\\nOther serum level tests\\nDue to the relationship between PTH and calcium,\\ncalcium levels should be tested at the same time asPTH. Most laboratories have established reference val-ues to indicate what PTH level is normal for a particularcalcium level. In addition, the effects of PTH on kidneyfunction and bone strength indicate that serum calcium,phosphorus, and creatinine levels should be measuredtogether with PTH. The creatinine test measures kid-\\nney function and aids in the diagnosis of parathyroiddysfunction.KEY TERMS\\nAssay —An analysis of the chemical composition\\nor strength of a substance.\\nHypercalcemia —Abnormally high levels of blood\\ncalcium.\\nHyperparathyroidism —Overactivity of the para-\\nthyroid glands.

This scanuses radioactive pharmaceuticals that are readily taken upby cells in the parathyroid glands to obtain an image ofthe glands and any abnormally active areas within them.\\nPurpose\\nThe parathyroid glands, embedded in the thyroid\\ngland in the neck, but separate from the thyroid in func-tion, control calcium metabolism in the body. Theparathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone (PTH).PTH regulates the level of calcium in the blood.\\nCalcium is critical to cellular metabolism, as well as\\nbeing the main component of bones. If too much PTH issecreted, the bones release calcium into the bloodstream.Over time, the bones become brittle and more likely tobreak. A person with levels of calcium in the blood thatare too high feels tired, run down, irritable, and has diffi-culty sleeping. Additional signs of too much calcium inthe blood are nausea and vomiting , frequent urination,\\nkidney stones and bone pain . A parathyroid scan is\\nadministered when the parathyroid appears to be overac-tive and a tumor is suspected.\\nPrecautions\\nParathyroid scans are not recommended for pregnant\\nwomen because of the potential harm to the developingfetus. People who have had another recent nuclear medi-cine procedure or an intravenous contrast test may needto wait until the earlier radioactive markers have beeneliminated from their system in order to obtain accurateresults from the parathyroid scan.\\nDescription\\nA parathyroid scan is a non-invasive procedure that\\nuses two radiopharmaceuticals (drugs with a radioactivemarker) to obtain an image of highly active areas of theparathyroid glands. The test can be done in two ways.\\nImmediate scan\\nIf the test is to be performed immediately, the patient\\nlies down on an imaging table with his head and neckextended and immobilized. The patient is injected withthe first radiopharmaceutical. After waiting 20 minutes,the patient is positioned under the camera for imaging.Each image takes five minutes. It is essential that thepatient remain still during imaging.\\nAfter the first image, the patient is injected with a\\nsecond radiopharmaceutical, and imaging continues foranother 25 minutes. Total time for the test is about onehour: injection 10 minutes, waiting period 20 minutes,and imaging 30 minutes.\\nAnother way to do this test is as follows. After the\\nfirst images are acquired, the patient returns two hourslater for additional images. Time for this procedure totalsabout three hours: injection 10 minutes, waiting periodtwo hours and 20 minutes, and imaging 30 minutes.\\nDelayed scan\\nIn a delayed parathyroid scan, the patient is asked to\\nswallow capsules containing the first radiopharmaceuti-cal. The patient returns after a four hour waiting period,and the initial image is made. Then the patient is injectedwith the second radiopharmaceutical. Imaging continuesfor another 25 minutes.

Theoperation begins when the anesthesiologist anesthetizesor puts the patient to sleep. The surgeon makes an inci-sion in the front of the neck where a tight-fitting necklacewould rest. All of the parathyroid glands are identified.The surgeon then identifies the gland or glands with thedisease and confirms the diagnosis by sending a piece ofthe gland(s) to the pathology department for immediatemicroscopic examination. The glands are then removedand the incision is closed and a dressing is placed overthe incision.\\nPatients generally stay overnight in the hospital after\\ncompletion of the operation and may remain for one ortwo additional days. These procedures are reimbursed byinsurance companies. Surgeon’s fees typically rangefrom $1,000–$2,000.

It is also grouped\\ntogether with typhoid fever under the name enteric\\nfever.\\nDescription\\nEnteric fever is increasingly rare in the United\\nStates. Of the 500 cases reported in an average year,about 60% are infections acquired during travel in Mexi-co, India, or South America.\\nParatyphoid fever has three stages: an early stage\\nmarked by high fever; a toxic stage with abdominal pain\\nand intestinal symptoms, and a long period of recoveryfrom fever (defervescence). In adults, these three phasesmay cover a period of four to six weeks; in children, theyare shorter and may cover 10 days to two weeks. Duringthe toxic stage there is a 1–10% chance of intestinal per-foration or hemorrhage.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nParatyphoid fever is caused by any of three strains of\\nSalmonella paratyphi :S. paratyphi A ; S. schottmuelleri\\n(also called S. paratyphi B ); or S. hirschfeldii (also called\\nS. paratyphi C ). It can be transmitted from animals or\\nanimal products to humans or from person to person. Theincubation period is one to two weeks but is often shorterin children. Symptom onset may be gradual in adults butis often sudden in children.\\nParatyphoid fever is marked by high fever,\\nheadache , loss of appetite, vomiting, and constipation\\nor diarrhea . The patient typically develops an enlarged\\nspleen. About 30% of patients have rose spots on thefront of the chest during the first week of illness. Therose spots develop into small hemorrhages that may behard to see in African or Native Americans.\\nPatients with intestinal complications have symp-\\ntoms resembling those of appendicitis : intense cramping\\npain with soreness in the right lower quadrant of theabdomen.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis is usually made on the basis of a his-\\ntory of recent travel and culturing the paratyphoid organ-ism. Because the disease is unusual in the United States,the doctor may not consider paratyphoid in the diagnosisunless the patient has the classic symptoms of anenlarged spleen and rose spots. The doctor will need torule out other diseases with high fevers, includingtyphus ,brucellosis ,tularemia (rabbit fever), psittacosis\\n(parrot fever ), mononucleosis, and Kawasaki syn-\\ndrome . S. paratyphi is easily cultured from samples of\\nblood, stool, urine, or bone marrow.Treatment\\nMedications\\nParatyphoid fever is treated with antibiotics over a\\ntwo- to three-week period with trimethoprim-sul-famethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra); amoxicillin (Amoxil,Novamoxin); and ampicillin (Amcill). Third-generationcephalosporins (ceftriaxone [Rocephin], cefotaxime\\n[Claforan], or cefixime [Suprax]) or chloramphenicol(Chloromycetin) may be given if the specific strain isresistant to other antibiotics.\\nSurgery\\nPatients with intestinal perforation or hemorrhage\\nmay need surgery if the infection cannot be controlled byantibiotics.\\nSupportive care\\nPatients with paratyphoid fever need careful moni-\\ntoring for signs of complications as well as bed rest andnutritional support. Patients with severe infections mayrequire fluid replacement or blood transfusions.\\nPrognosis\\nMost patients with paratyphoid fever recover com-\\npletely, although intestinal complications can result indeath .

It occurs whencells in one of the movement-control centers of the brainbegin to die for unknown reasons. PD was first noted byBritish physician James Parkinson in the early 1800s.\\nDescription\\nUsually beginning in a person’s late fifties or early\\nsixties, Parkinson disease causes a progressive decline inmovement control, affecting the ability to control initia-tion, speed, and smoothness of motion. Symptoms of PDare seen in up to 15% of those ages 65–74, and almost30% of those ages 75–84.\\nMost cases of PD are sporadic. This means that there\\nis a spontaneous and permanent change in nucleotidesequences (the building blocks of genes). Sporadic muta-tions also involve unknown environmental factors incombination with genetic defects. The abnormal gene(mutated gene) will form an altered end-product or pro-tein. This will cause abnormalities in specific areas in thebody where the protein is used.

This implies that an affected parent has a\\n50% chance of transmitting the disease to any child. Thistype of inheritance is not commonly observed. The mostrecent evidence is linking PD with a gene that codes for aprotein called alpha-synuclein. Further research isattempting to fully understand the relationship with thisprotein and nerve cell degeneration.\\nPD affects approximately 500,000 people in the\\nUnited States, both men and women, with as many asfifty thousand new cases each year.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe immediate cause of PD is degeneration of brain\\ncells in the area known as the substantia nigra, one of themovement control centers of the brain. Damage to thisarea leads to the cluster of symptoms known as “parkin-sonism.” In PD, degenerating brain cells contain Lewybodies, which help identify the disease. The cell deathleading to parkinsonism may be caused by a number ofconditions, including infection, trauma, and poisoning .\\nSome drugs given for psychosis , such as haloperidol\\n(Haldol) or chlorpromazine (thorazine), may causeparkinsonism. When no cause for nigral cell degenera-tion can be found, the disorder is called idiopathicparkinsonism, or Parkinson disease. Parkinsonism maybe seen in other degenerative conditions, known as the“parkinsonism plus” syndromes, such as progressive\\nsupranuclear palsy .\\nThe substantia nigra, or “black substance,” is one of\\nthe principal movement control centers in the brain. Byreleasing the neurotransmitter known as dopamine, ithelps to refine movement patterns throughout the body.The dopamine released by nerve cells of substantia nigrastimulates another brain region, the corpus striatum.Without enough dopamine, the corpus striatum cannotcontrol its targets, and so on down the line. Ultimately,the movement patterns of walking, writing, reaching forobjects, and other basic programs cannot operate proper-ly, and the symptoms of parkinsonism are the result.\\nThere are some known toxins that can cause parkin-\\nsonism, most notoriously a chemical called MPTP, foundas an impurity in some illegal drugs. Parkinsonian symp-toms appear within hours of ingestion, and are perma-nent. MPTP may exert its effects through generation oftoxic molecular fragments called free radicals, andreducing free radicals has been a target of several experi-mental treatments for PD using antioxidants.\\nIt is possible that early exposure to some as-yet-\\nunidentified environmental toxin or virus leads to unde-tected nigral cell death, and PD then manifests as normalage-related decline brings the number of functioningnigral cells below the threshold needed for normal move-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2500Parkinson’s disease'),\n",

It is also possible that, for genetic reasons, some\\npeople are simply born with fewer cells in their substan-tia nigra than others, and they develop PD as a conse-quence of normal decline.\\nSymptoms\\nThe identifying symptoms of PD include:\\n• Tremors, usually beginning in the hands, often occuring\\non one side before the other. The classic tremor of PD iscalled a “pill-rolling tremor,” because the movementresembles rolling a pill between the thumb and forefin-ger. This tremor occurs at a frequency of about threeper second.\\n• Slow movements (bradykinesia) occur, which may\\ninvolve slowing down or stopping in the middle of famil-iar tasks such as walking, eating, or shaving. This mayinclude freezing in place during movements (akinesia).\\n• Muscle rigidity or stiffness, occuring with jerky move-\\nments replacing smooth motion.\\n• Postural instability or balance difficulty occurs. This\\nmay lead to a rapid, shuffling gait (festination) to pre-vent falling.\\n• In most cases, there is a “masked face,” with little facial\\nexpression and decreased eye-blinking.\\nIn addition, a wide range of other symptoms may\\noften be seen, some beginning earlier than others:\\n• depression\\n• speech changes, including rapid speech without inflec-\\ntion changes\\n• problems with sleep, including restlessness and night-\\nmares\\n• emotional changes, including fear, irritability, and inse-\\ncurity\\n• incontinence\\n•constipation\\n• handwriting changes, with letters becoming smaller\\nacross the page (micrographia)\\n• progressive problems with intellectual function ( demen-\\ntia)\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease involves a\\ncareful medical history and a neurological exam to lookfor characteristic symptoms. There are no definitive testsfor PD, although a variety of lab tests may be done torule out other causes of symptoms, especially if onlysome of the identifying symptoms are present. Tests forother causes of parkinsonism may include brain scans,blood tests, lumbar puncture, and x rays.Treatment\\nThere is no cure for Parkinson’s disease. Most drugs\\ntreat the symptoms of the disease only, although onedrug, selegiline (Eldepryl), may slow degeneration of thesubstantia nigra.\\nExercise, nutrition, and physical therapy\\nRegular, moderate exercise has been shown to\\nimprove motor function without an increase in medicationfor a person with PD. Exercise helps maintain range ofmotion in stiff muscles, improve circulation, and stimulateappetite. An exercise program designed by a physical ther-apist has the best chance of meeting the specific needs ofthe person with PD. A physical therapist may also suggeststrategies for balance compensation and techniques tostimulate movement during slowdowns or freezes.\\nGood nutrition is important to maintenance of\\ngeneral health. A person with PD may lose some inter-est in food, especially if depressed, and may have nau-sea from the disease or from medications, especiallythose known as dopamine agonists. Slow movementsmay make it difficult to eat quickly, and delayed gastricemptying may lead to a feeling of fullness without hav-ing eaten much. Increasing fiber in the diet can improveconstipation, soft foods can reduce the amount of need-ed chewing, and a prokinetic drug such as cisapride(Propulsid) can increase the movement of food throughthe digestive system.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2501Parkinson’s disease\\nA sample of fetal nigral cells.

The main drug used to treat PD, L-\\ndopa, is an amino acid, and is absorbed by the digestivesystem by the same transporters that pick up other aminoacids broken down from proteins in the diet. Limitingprotein, under the direction of the physician or a nutri-tionist, can improve the absorption of L-dopa.\\nNo evidence indicates that vitamin or mineral sup-\\nplements can have any effect on the disease other than inthe improvement of the patient’s general health. Noantioxidants used to date have shown promise as a treat-ment except for selegiline, an MAO-B inhibitor which isdiscussed in the Drugs section. A large, carefully con-trolled study of vitamin E demonstrated that it could nothalt disease progression.\\nDrugs\\nThe pharmacological treatment of Parkinson disease\\nis complex. While there are a large number of drugs thatcan be effective, their effectiveness varies with thepatient, disease progression, and the length of time thedrug has been used. Dose-related side effects may pre-clude using the most effective dose, or require the intro-duction of a new drug to counteract them. There are fiveclasses of drugs currently used to treat PD.\\nDRUGS THAT REPLACE DOPAMINE. One drug that\\nhelps replace dopamine, levodopa (L-dopa), is the singlemost effective treatment for the symptoms of PD. L-dopais a derivative of dopamine, and is converted intodopamine by the brain. It may be started when symptomsbegin, or when they become serious enough to interferewith work or daily living.\\nL-dopa therapy usually remains effective for five\\nyears or longer. Following this, many patients developmotor fluctuations, including peak-dose “dyskinesias”(abnormal movements such as tics, twisting, or restless-ness), rapid loss of response after dosing (known as the“on-off” phenomenon), and unpredictable drug response.Higher doses are usually tried, but may lead to anincrease in dyskinesias. In addition, side effects of L-dopa include nausea and vomiting , and low blood pres-\\nsure upon standing ( orthostatic hypotension ), which\\ncan cause dizziness . These effects usually lessen after\\nseveral weeks of therapy.\\nENZYME INHIBITORS. Dopamine is broken down by\\nseveral enzyme systems in the brain and elsewhere in thebody, and blocking these enzymes is a key strategy to pro-longing the effect of dopamine. The two most commonlyprescribed forms of L-dopa contain a drug to inhibit theamino acid decarboxylase (an AADC inhibitor), one typeof enzyme that breaks down dopamine. These combina-tion drugs are Sinemet (L-dopa plus carbidopa) and\\nMadopar (L-dopa plus benzaseride). Controlled-releaseformulations also aid in prolonging the effective intervalof an L-dopa dose.\\nThe enzyme monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B)\\ninhibitor selegiline may be given as add-on therapy for L-dopa. Research indicates selegiline may have a neuropro-tective effect, sparing nigral cells from damage by freeradicals. Because of this, and the fact that it has few sideeffects, it is also frequently prescribed early in the diseasebefore L-dopa is begun. Entacapone and tolcapone, twoinhibitors of another enzyme system called catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), may soon reach the marketas early studies suggest that they effectively treat PDsymptoms with fewer motor fluctuations and decreaseddaily L-dopa requirements.\\nDOPAMINE AGONISTS. Dopamine works by stimu-\\nlating receptors on the surface of corpus striatum cells.Drugs that also stimulate these cells are called dopamineagonists, or DAs. DAs may be used before L-dopa thera-py, or added on to avoid requirements for higher L-dopadoses late in the disease. DAs available in the UnitedStates as of early 1998, include bromocriptine (Permax,Parlodel), pergolide (Permax), and pramipexole(Mirapex). Two more, cabergoline (Dostinex) and ropini-role (Requip), are expected to be approved soon. Otherdopamine agonists in use elsewhere include lisuride(Dopergine) and apomorphine. Side effects of all theDAs are similar to those of dopamine, plus confusion andhallucinations at higher doses.\\nANTICHOLINERGIC DRUGS. Anticholinergics main-\\ntain dopamine balance as levels decrease. However, theside effects of anticholinergics ( dry mouth , constipation,\\nconfusion, and blurred vision) are usually too severe inolder patients or in patients with dementia. In addition,anticholinergics rarely work for very long. They are oftenprescribed for younger patients who have predominantshaking. Trihexyphenidyl (Artane) is the drug most com-monly prescribed.\\nDRUGS WHOSE MODE OF ACTION IS UNCERTAIN.\\nAmantadine (Symmetrel) is sometimes used as an earlytherapy before L-dopa is begun, and as an add-on later inthe disease. Its anti-parkinsonian effects are mild, and arenot seen in many patients. Clozapine (Clozaril) is effec-tive especially against psychiatric symptoms of late PD,including psychosis and hallucinations.\\nSurgery\\nTwo surgical procedures are used for treatment of\\nPD that cannot be controlled adequately with drug thera-py.

In a pallidotomy, the GPi is destroyed by heat,delivered by long thin needles inserted under anesthesia.Electrical stimulation of the GPi is another way to reduceits action. In this procedure, fine electrodes are insertedto deliver the stimulation, which may be adjusted orturned off as the response dictates. Other regions of thebrain may also be stimulated by electrodes inserted else-where. In most patients, these procedures lead to signifi-cant improvement for some motor symptoms, includingpeak-dose dyskinesias. This allows the patient to receivemore L-dopa, since these dyskinesias are usually whatcauses an upper limit on the L-dopa dose.\\nA third procedure, transplant of fetal nigral cells, is\\nstill highly experimental. Its benefits to date have beenmodest, although improvements in technique and patientselection are likely to change that.\\nAlternative treatment\\nCurrently, the best treatments for PD involve the use\\nof conventional drugs such as levodopa. Alternative ther-apies, including acupuncture , massage, and yoga , can\\nhelp relieve some symptoms of the disease and loosentight muscles. Alternative practitioners have also appliedherbal and dietary therapies, including amino acid sup-plementation, antioxidant ( vitamins A, C, E, selenium,\\nand zinc) therapy, B vitamin supplementation, and calci-um and magnesium supplementation, to the treatment ofPD. Anyone using these therapies in conjunction withconventional drugs should check with their doctor toavoid the possibility of adverse interactions. For exam-ple, vitamin B\\n6(either as a supplement or from foods\\nsuch as whole grains, bananas, beef, fish, liver, and pota-toes) can interfere with the action of L-dopa when thedrug is taken without carbidopa.\\nPrognosis\\nDespite medical treatment, the symptoms of Parkin-\\nson disease worsen over time, and become less respon-sive to drug therapy.

A number oftumors can develop in the parotid gland. Many of theseare tumors that have spread from other areas of thebody, entering the parotid gland by way of the lym-phatic system. Among the tumors seen in the parotidgland are lymphoma, melanoma, and squamous cellcarcinoma.\\nDescription\\nThe parotid gland is the largest of the salivary\\nglands. There are two parotid glands, one on each sideof the face. They lie just in front of the ears and a ductruns from each to the inside of the cheek. Each parotidgland has several lobes. Surgery is recommend as part ofthe treatment for all cancers in the parotid gland. Super-ficial or localized parotidectomy is recommended bysome authorities, unless a lipoma or Warthin’s tumor ispresent. One of the advantages to this approach is thatnerves to facial muscles are left intact. Many facialnerves run through the same area as the parotid glandand can be damaged during more complete parotidec-tomies. Most authorities recommend total parotidecto-my, especially if cancer is found in both the superficial\\nand deep lobes of the parotid gland. If the tumor hasspread to involve the facial nerve, the operation isexpanded to include parts of bone behind the ear (mas-toid) to remove as much tumor as possible. Someauthorities recommend post-surgery radiation as follow-up treatment for cancer.\\nAftercare\\nAfter surgery, the patient will remain in the hospital\\nfor one to three days. The site of incision will be watchedclosely for signs of infection and heavy bleeding (hemor-rhage). The incision site should be kept clean and dryuntil it is completely healed. The patient should not washtheir hair until the stitches have been removed. If thepatient has difficulty smiling, winking, or drinking flu-ids, the physician should be contacted immediately.These are signs of facial nerve damage.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2504Parotidectomy'),\n",

Atrialtachycardia means that the upper chambers of the heartare beating abnormally fast. Paroxysmal atrial tachycar-dia can occur without any heart disease being present. Itis usually more annoying than dangerous.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nParoxysmal atrial tachycardia may be caused by sev-\\neral different things.

A care-ful description of the episode will aid the doctor in hisdiagnosis. If the rapid heart rate is still occurring, anelectrocardiograph (ECG) will show the condition.

It is transmitted from pet birds or\\npoultry. The illness is caused by a chlamydia, which is a typeof intracellular parasite closely related to bacteria. Parrotfever is also called chlamydiosis, psittacosis, or ornithosis.KEY TERMS\\nPremature atrial beat —A beat that occurs before\\nit would normally be expected.\\nSupraventricular —A term for an event that occurs\\nin the upper chambers (atria) of the heart.Description\\nParrot fever, which is referred to as avian psittacosis\\nwhen it infects birds, is caused by Chlamydia psittaci .\\nPet birds in the parrot family, including parrots, para-keets, macaws, and cockatiels, are the most common car-riers of the infection. Other birds that may also spread C.\\npsittaci include pigeons, doves, mynah birds, and\\nturkeys. Birds that are carrying the organism may appearhealthy, but can shed it in their feces. The symptoms ofavian psittacosis include inactivity, loss of appetite andruffled feathers, diarrhea , runny eyes and nasal dis-\\ncharge, and green or yellow-green urine. Sick birds canbe treated with antibiotics by a veterinarian.\\nC. psittaci is usually spread from birds to humans\\nthrough exposure to infected bird feces during cagecleaning or by handling infected birds. In humans, parrotfever can range in severity from minor flu-like symptomsto severe and life-threatening pneumonia.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nParrot fever is usually transmitted by inhaling dust\\nfrom dried bird droppings or by handling infected birds.Humans can also spread the disease by person-to-personcontact, but that is very rare. The symptoms usuallydevelop within five to 14 days of exposure and includefever ,headache , chills, loss of appetite, cough , and tired-\\nness. In the most severe cases of parrot fever, the patientdevelops pneumonia. People who work in pet shops orwho keep pet birds are the most likely to become infected.\\nDiagnosis\\nOnly 100–200 cases of parrot fever are reported\\neach year in the United States. It is possible, however,that the illness is more common since it is easily con-fused with other types of influenza or pneumonia. Doc-\\ntors are most likely to consider a diagnosis of parrotfever if the patient has a recent history of exposure tobirds. The diagnosis can be confirmed by blood tests forantibodies, usually complement fixation or immunofluo-rescence tests. The organism is difficult to culture. Achest x ray may also be used to diagnose the pneumonia\\ncaused by C. psittaci .\\nTreatment\\nPsittacosis is treated with an antibiotic, usually tetra-\\ncycline (Achromycin, Sumycin); doxycycline (Doxy,Vibramycin); or erythromycin (Eryc, Ilotycin). Oralmedication is typically prescribed for at least 10–14days. Severely ill patients may be given intravenousantibiotics for the first few days of therapy.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2506Parrot fever'),\n",

The combination of tests narrows the list of\\npossible missing or defective factors.\\nHeparin prevents clotting by blocking certain factors\\nin the intrinsic pathway. The PTT test allows a doctor tocheck that there is enough heparin in the blood to preventclotting, but not so much as to cause bleeding. The test isdone before the first dose of heparin or whenever thedosage level is changed; and again when the heparin hasreached a constant level in the blood. The PTT test isrepeated at scheduled intervals.\\nThe PTT test uses blood to which a chemical has\\nbeen added to prevent clotting before the test begins.About 5 mL of blood are drawn from a vein in thepatient’s inner elbow region. Collection of the sampletakes only a few minutes. The blood is spun in a cen-trifuge, which separates the pale yellow liquid part ofblood (plasma) from the cells. Calcium and activatingsubstances are added to the plasma to start the intrinsicpathway of the coagulation cascade.

If the patient is on heparin therapy, the bloodsample is drawn one hour before the next dose ofheparin.\\nAftercare\\nAftercare includes routine care of the puncture site.\\nIn addition, patients on heparin therapy must be watchedfor signs of spontaneous bleeding. The patient should notbe left alone until the doctor or nurse is sure that bleedinghas stopped.

People with coagulation problems maybleed for a longer period than normal.\\nNormal results\\nNormal results vary based on the method and activa-\\ntors used. Normal APTT results are usually between25–40 seconds; PTT results are between 60–70 seconds.APTT results for a patient on heparin should be 1.5–2.5times normal values. An APTT longer than 100 secondsindicates spontaneous bleeding.\\nAbnormal results\\nIncreased levels in a person with a bleeding disorder\\nindicate a clotting factor may be missing or defective.Further tests are done to identify the factor involved.Liver disease decreases production of factors, increasingthe PTT.\\nLow levels in a patient on heparin indicate too little\\nheparin is in the blood to prevent clots.

The extra chro-mosome 13 causes numerous physical and mental abnor-malities, especially heart defects. Patau syndrome isnamed for Dr. Klaus Patau, who reported the syndromeand its association with trisomy in 1960.\\nDescription\\nChildren normally inherit 23 chromosomes from\\neach parent, for a total of 46 chromosomes. A typicalhuman being has 46 chromosomes: 22 pairs of non-sexlinked chromosomes and one pair of sex-linked chromo-somes, that determine that child’s sex. Sometimes a childmay end up with more than 46 chromosomes because ofproblems with the father’s sperm or the mother’s egg; or,because of mutations that occurred after the sperm andthe egg fused to form the embryo (conception).\\nNormally, there are two copies of each of the 23\\nchromosomes: one from each parent. A condition calledtrisomy occurs when three, instead of two, copies of achromosome are present in a developing human embryo.An extra copy of a particular chromosome can comeeither from the egg or sperm, or because of mutationsthat occur after conception.\\nThe most well-known trisomy-related disorder is\\nDown syndrome (trisomy 21), in which the developing\\nembryo has an extra copy of chromosome 21. Patau syn-drome is trisomy 13, in which the developing embryo hasthree copies of chromosome 13.An extra copy of chromosome 13 is not the only\\ncause of Patau syndrome. Other changes in chromosome13, such as mispositioning (translocation), can also resultin the characteristics classified as Patau syndrome. Inthese cases, an error occurs that causes a portion of chro-mosome 13 to be exchanged for a portion of anotherchromosome. There is no production of extra chromo-somes; but, a portion of each affected chromosome is“misplaced” (translocated) to another chromosome.\\nPatau syndrome causes serious physical and mental\\nabnormalities including: heart defects; incomplete braindevelopment; unusual facial features such as a slopingforehead, a smaller than average head (microcephaly),small or missing eyes, low set ears, and cleft palate orhare lip; extra fingers and toes (polydactyly); abnormalgenitalia; spinal defects; seizures; gastrointestinal her-nias, particularly at the navel (omphalocele); and mental\\nretardation . Due to the severity of these conditions,\\nfewer than 20% of those affected with Patau syndromesurvive beyond infancy.\\nGenetic profile\\nWhen an extra copy (trisomy) of a chromosome is\\nmade, it may either be a total trisomy (in which an extracopy of the entire chromosome is made), or partial tri-somy (in which only one part of the chromosome is madean extra time).\\nIn most cases of trisomy, errors in chromosome\\nduplication occur at conception because of problems withthe egg or the sperm that are coming together to producean offspring. In these cases, every cell in the body of theoffspring has an extra copy of the affected chromosome.However, errors in chromosome duplication may alsooccur during the rapid cell division that takes place imme-diately after conception. In these cases, only some cells ofthe body have the extra chromosome error. The conditionin which only some of the cells in the body have the extrachromosome is called mosaicism.\\nSeventy-five to 80 percent of the cases of Patau syn-\\ndrome are caused by a trisomy of chromosome 13. Someof these cases are the result of a total trisomy, while oth-ers are the result of a partial trisomy. Partial trisomy gen-erally causes less severe physical symptoms than full tri-somy. Ten percent of these cases are of the mosaic type,in which only some of the body’s cells have the extrachromosome. The physical symptoms of the mosaic formof Patau syndrome depends on the number and type ofcells that carry the trisomy.\\nMost cases of trisomy are not passed on from one\\ngeneration to the next. Usually they result from a mal-function in the cell division (mitosis) that occurs after\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2509Patau syndrome'),\n",

At least 75% of the cases of Patau syndrome\\nare caused by errors in chromosome replication that occurafter conception. The remaining 25% are caused by theinheritance of translocations of chromosome 13 withother chromosomes within the parental chromosomes. Inthese cases, a portion of another chromosome switchesplaces with a portion of chromosome 13. This leads toerrors in the genes on both chromosome 13 and the chro-mosome from which the translocated portion originated.\\nPatau syndrome occurs in approximately one in\\n10,000 live births. In many cases, spontaneous abortion(miscarriage ) occurs and the fetus does not survive to\\nterm. In other cases, the affected individual is stillborn.As appears to be the case in all trisonomies, the risks ofPatau syndrome seem to increase with the mother’s age,particularly if she is over 30 when pregnant. Male andfemale children are equally affected, and the syndromeoccurs in all races.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe severity and symptoms of Patau syndrome vary\\nwith the type of chromosomal anomaly, from extremelyserious conditions to nearly normal appearance and func-tioning. Full trisomy 13, which is present in the majorityof the cases, results in the most severe and numerousinternal and external abnormalities. Commonly, the fore-brain fails to divide into lobes or hemispheres (holopros-encephaly) and the entire head is unusually small (micro-cephaly). The spinal cord may protrude through a defectin the vertebrae of the spinal column (myelomeningo-cele). Children who survive infancy have profound men-tal retardation and may experience seizures.\\nIncomplete development of the optic (sight) and olfac-\\ntory (smell) nerves often accompany the brain defectsdescribed above. The eyes may be unusually small(microphthalmia) or one eye may be absent (anoph-thalmia). The eyes are sometimes set close together(hypotelorism) or even fused into a single structure. Incom-plete development of any structures in the eye (coloboma)or failure of the retina to develop properly (retinal dyspla-sia) will also produce vision problems. Patau syndromeaffected individuals may be born either partially or totallydeaf and many are subject to recurring ear infections.\\nThe facial features of many Patau syndrome affected\\nindividuals appear flattened. The ears are generally mal-formed and lowset. Frequently, a child with trisomy 13has a cleft lip, a cleft palate, or both. Other physical char-acteristics include loose folds of skin at the back of theneck, extra fingers or toes (polydactyly), permanentlyflexed (closed) fingers (camptodactyly), noticeablyprominent heels, “rocker-bottom foot,” and missing ribs.Genital malformations are common in individuals affect-ed with Patau syndrome and include undescended testi-\\ncles (cryptorchidism), an abnormally developed scrotum,and ambiguous genitalia in males, or an abnormallyformed uterus (bicornuate uterus) in females.\\nIn nearly all cases, Patau syndrome affected infants\\nhave respiratory difficulties and heart defects, includingatrial and ventricular septal defects (holes betweenchambers of the heart); malformed ducts that causeabnormal direction of blood flow ( patent ductus arte-\\nriosus ); holes in the valves of the lungs and the heart\\n(pulmonary and aortic valves); and misplacement of theheart in the right, rather than the left, side of the chest(dextrocardia). The kidneys and gastrointestinal systemmay also be affected with cysts similar to those seen inpolycystic kidney disease . These defects are frequently\\nsevere and life-threatening.\\nPartial trisomy of the distal segment of chromosome\\n13 results in generally less severe, but still serious, symp-toms and a distinctive facial appearance including a shortupturned nose, a longer than usual area between the noseand upper lip (philtrum), bushy eyebrows, and tumorsmade up of blood capillaries on the forehead (frontalcapillary hemangiomata). Partial trisomy of the proximalsegment of chromosome 13 is much less likely to be fataland has been associated with a variety of facial featuresincluding a large nose, a short upper lip, and a recedingjaw. Both forms of partial trisomy also result in severemental retardation.\\nBeyond one month of age, other symptoms that are\\nseen in individuals with Patau syndrome are: feeding dif-ficulties and constipation , reflux disease, slow growth\\nrates, curvature of the spine ( scoliosis ), irritability, sensi-\\ntivity to sunlight, low muscle tone, high blood pressure,sinus infections, urinary tract infections, and ear and eyeinfections.\\nDiagnosis\\nPatau syndrome is detectable during pregnancy\\nthrough the use of ultrasound imaging, amniocentesis ,\\nand chorionic villus sampling (CVS). At birth, the new-\\nborn’s numerous malformations indicate a possible chro-mosomal abnormality. Trisomy 13 is confirmed by exam-ining the infant’s chromosomal pattern through karyotyp-ing or another procedure. Karyotyping involves the sepa-ration and isolation of the chromosomes present in cellstaken from an individual. These cells are generally extract-ed from cells found in a blood sample. The 22 non-sexlinked chromosomes are identified by size, from largest tosmallest, as chromosomes 1 through 22. The sex determin-ing chromosomes are also identified. Patau syndrome isconfirmed by the presence of three, rather than the normaltwo, copies of the thirteenth largest chromosome.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2510Patau syndrome'),\n",

Johnson\\nPatent ductus arteriosus\\nDefinition\\nPatent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a heart defect that\\noccurs when the ductus arteriosus (the temporary fetalblood vessel that connects the aorta and the pulmonaryartery) does not close at birth.\\nDescription\\nThe ductus arteriosus is a temporary fetal blood ves-\\nsel that connects the aorta and the pulmonary arterybefore birth. The ductus arteriosus should be present andopen before birth while the fetus is developing in theuterus. Since oxygen and nutrients are received from theplacenta and the umbilical cord instead of the lungs, theductus arteriosus acts as a “short cut” that allows bloodto bypass the deflated lungs and go straight out to thebody. After birth, when the lungs are needed to add oxy-gen to the blood, the ductus arteriosus normally closes.The closure of the ductus arteriosus ensures that bloodgoes to the lungs to pick up oxygen before going out tothe body. Closure of the ductus arteriosus usually occursat birth as levels of certain chemicals, called prostaglad-ins, change and the lungs fill with air. If the ductus arte-riosus closes correctly, the blood pumped from the heartgoes to the lungs, back into the heart, and then out to thebody through the aorta. The blood returning from thelungs and moving out of the aorta carries oxygen to thecells of the body.In some infants, the ductus arteriosus remains open\\n(or patent) and the resulting heart defect is known aspatent ductus arteriosus. In most cases, a small PDA doesnot result in physical symptoms. If the PDA is larger,health complications may occur.\\nIn an average individual’s body, the power of blood\\nbeing pumped by the heart and other forces leads to acertain level of pressure between the heart and lungs. Thepressure between the heart and lungs of an individualaffected by PDA causes some of the oxygenated bloodthat should go out to the body (through the aorta) toreturn back through the PDA into the pulmonary artery.The pulmonary artery takes the blood immediately backto the lungs. The recycling of the already oxygenatedblood forces the heart to work harder as it tries to supplyenough oxygenated blood to the body. In this case, usual-ly the left side of the heart grows larger as it works hard-er and must contain all of the extra blood moving backinto the heart. This is know as a left-to-right or aortic-pulmonary shunt.\\nAs noted, the size of the PDA determines how much\\nharder the heart has to work and how much bigger theheart becomes. If the PDA is large, the bottom left side ofthe heart is forced to pump twice as much blood becauseit must supply enough blood to recycle back to the lungsand move out to the body. As the heart responds to theincreased demands for more oxygenated blood by pump-ing harder, the pulmonary artery has to change in sizeand shape in order to adapt to the increased amount andforce of the blood. In some cases, the increase in size andshape changes the pressure in the pulmonary artery andlungs. If the pressure in the lungs is higher than that ofthe heart and body, blood returning to the heart will takethe short cut back into the aorta from the pulmonaryartery through the PDA instead of going to the lungs.This backward flowing of blood does not carry muchoxygen. If blood without much oxygen is being deliveredto the body, the legs and toes will turn blue or cyanotic.This is called a shunt reversal.\\nWhen a PDA results in a large amount of blood\\nbeing cycled in the wrong order, either through a left-to-right shunt or shunt reversal, the overworked, enlargedheart may stop working (congestive heart failure ) and\\nthe lungs can become filled with too much fluid ( pul-\\nmonary edema ). At this time, there is also an increased\\nrisk for a bacterial infection that can inflame the lining ofthe heart ( endocarditis ). These three complications are\\nvery serious.\\nPDA is a very common heart defect.

PDA is two to three times more common in\\nfemales than males. PDA occurs in individuals of everyethnic origin and does not occur more frequently in anyone country or ethnic population.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPDA can be a result of an environmental exposure\\nbefore birth, inheriting a specific changed or mutatedgene or genes, a symptom of a genetic syndrome, or becaused by a combination of genetic and environmentalfactors (multifactorial).\\nEnvironmental exposures that can increase the\\nchance for a baby to be affected by PDA include fetalexposure to rubella before birth, preterm delivery, andbirth at a high altitude location.\\nPDA can be an inherited condition running in fami-\\nlies as isolated PDA or part of a genetic syndrome. Ineither case, there are specific gene changes or mutationswhich lead to a defect in the elastic tissue forming thewalls of the ductus arteriosus. The genes causing isolated\\nPDA have not been identified, but it is known that PDAcan be inherited through a family in an autosomal domi-nant pattern or an autosomal recessive pattern.\\nEvery person has approximately 30,000 genes,\\nwhich tell our bodies how to grow and develop correctly.Each gene is present in pairs since one is inherited fromour mother, and one is inherited from our father. In anautosomal dominant condition, only one specificchanged or mutated copy of the gene for PDA is neces-sary for a person to have PDA. If a parent has an autoso-mal dominant form of PDA, there is a 50% chance foreach child to have the same or similar condition.\\nPDA can also be inherited in an autosomal recessive\\nmanner. A recessive condition occurs when a childreceives two changed or mutated copies of the gene for aparticular condition, such as PDA (one copy from eachparent). Individuals with a single changed or mutated copyof a gene for a recessive condition, are known as “carri-ers,” and have no health problems related to the condition.In fact, each of us carries between five and 10 genes forharmful, recessive conditions.

Respiration is the process bywhich nutrients (specifically sugar, or glucose) and oxy-gen are taken in, chemical reactions take place, energy isproduced and stored, and carbon monoxide and wastesare given off. This process is absolutely central to basiccell functioning, and thus the functioning of the body asa whole.\\nNiacin is a B vitamin found in such foods as yeast,\\nliver, meat, fish, whole-grain cereals and breads, andlegumes. Niacin can also be produced within the bodyfrom the essential amino acid called tryptophan. Dietaryrequirements for niacin depend on the age, gender, size,and activity level of the individual. Niacin requirementsrange from 5 mg in infants up to 20 mg in certain adults.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPellagra can be either primary or secondary. Prima-\\nry pellagra results when the diet is extremely deficientin niacin-rich foods. A classic example occurs in geo-graphic locations where Indian corn (maize) is thedietary staple. Maize does contain niacin, but in a formwhich cannot be absorbed from the intestine (exceptwhen it has been treated with alkali, as happens in thepreparation of tortillas). People who rely on maize astheir major food source often develop pellagra. Pellagracan also occur when a hospitalized patient, unable toeat for a very prolonged period of time, is given fluidsdevoid of vitamins through a needle in the vein (intra-venous or IV fluids).\\nSecondary pellagra occurs when adequate quantities\\nof niacin are present in the diet, but other diseases orconditions interfere with its absorption and/or process-ing. This is seen in various diseases that cause prolongeddiarrhea , with cirrhosis of the liver and alcoholism ,\\nwith long-term use of the anti-tuberculosis drug calledisoniazid, in patients with malignant carcinoid tumor,and in patients suffering from Hartnup disease (an\\ninherited disorder which results in disordered absorptionof amino acids from the intestine and kidney).\\nPellagra causes a variety of symptoms affecting the\\nskin; mucous membranes (moist linings of the mouth,organs, etc.); central nervous system (including thebrain and nerves); and the gastrointestinal system. Theclassic collection of symptoms includes redness andswelling of the mouth and tongue, diarrhea, skin rash,and abnormal mental functioning, including memoryloss. While early patients may simply have a light skinrash, over time the skin becomes increasingly thickened,pigmented, and may slough off in places. Areas of theskin may become prone to bacterial infection. Themouth and tongue, and sometimes the vagina, becomeincreasingly thick, swollen, and red. Abdominal pain\\nand bloating occur, with nausea and vomiting , and\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2515Pellagra'),\n",

Initial mental changes appear\\nas inability to sleep ( insomnia ),fatigue , and a sense of\\ndisconnectedness (apathy). These mental changesprogress to memory loss, confusion, depression, andhallucinations (in which the individual sees sights or\\nhears sounds that do not really exist). The most severestates include stiffness of the arms and legs, with resis-tance to attempts to move the limbs; variations in levelof consciousness; and the development of involuntarysucking and grasping motions. This collection of symp-toms is called “encephalopathic syndrome.”\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is purely based on the patient’s collection\\nof symptoms, together with information regarding thepatient’s diet. When this information points to niacindeficiency, replacement is started, and the diagnosis isthen partly made by evaluating the patient’s response toincreased amounts of niacin. There are no chemical testsavailable to definitively diagnose pellagra.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of pellagra usually involves supplement-\\ning the individual’s diet with a form of niacin calledniacinamide (niacin itself in pure supplementation formcauses a number of unpleasant side effects, includingsensations of itching , burning, and flushing). The niaci-\\nnamide can be given by mouth (orally) or by injection(when diarrhea would interfere with its absorption). Theusual oral dosage is 300–500 mg each day; the usualdosage of an injection is 100–250 mg, administered twoto three times each day. When pellagra has progressed tothe point of the encephalopathic syndrome, a patient willrequire 1,000 mg of niacinamide orally, and 100-250 mgof niacinamide by injection. Once the symptoms of pel-lagra have subsided, a maintenance dose of niacin can becalculated, along with attempting (where possible) tomake appropriate changes in the diet.

In addition,\\nexams detect some forms of cancer that may affect the\\ngenitalia. By analyzing the cervical region with a Papani-colaou or Pap smear, clinicians are able to look for signsof cervical cancer . The American Cancer Society and\\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecolo-gists recommend pelvic exams with Pap smears forwomen starting at age 18. It is also recommended thatexams start earlier if the teenager requests oral contra-\\nception . Pap smears should continue once yearly for\\nthree years and at the physicians discretion following thistime. Various groups differ in opinions on when to dis-continue screening for cervical cancer, however, theUnited States Preventative Services Task Force recom-mends screening continue until age 65 if the patient hasnot had previous abnormal results. Women who haveundergone a total hysterectomy for reasons other than\\ncervical cancer do not need to be screened.\\nPrecautions\\nPelvic examinations are safe procedures, thus no\\nprecautions are necessary.\\nDescription\\nThe first part of the examination involves visual\\ninspection and palpation of the external genitalia. Theexaminer will note the characteristics of the labia majora,labia minora, clitoris, urethral orifice, and the Skene’s and\\nBartholin’s glands. In addition, the perineum and anuswill be checked. The clinician will be examining theseareas for any indication of swelling, inflammation, abnor-mal discharge, polyps, abnormal odor, or other lesions.\\nThe next part involves examining the internal geni-\\ntalia. The examiner will first insert a gloved finger intothe vagina in order to palpate the cervix—the vaginalwalls. Next an instrument called a speculum is inserted.This device is made of plastic or metal and used to openthe vaginal cavity in order for the examiner to be able toview the vaginal walls and cervix. Any lesions, bleeding,or abnormal discharge can be visualized with the specu-lum in place. If indicated, a Pap smear will then be per-formed. With the speculum still in place, the examinergently scrapes the patient’s cervix with a wooden or plas-tic spatula as well as a cylindrical-type brush. The spatu-la collects cells from the outer surface of the cervix,while the brush is used to collect cells from the inner-cervix. The collected cells are then spread on a glassslide, sprayed with a fixative, and sent to a laboratory foranalysis. The examiner may then insert a cotton orDacron swab into the cervix. This will be held in placefor 10–30 seconds and when withdrawn spread on a plas-tic plate or into a tube containing a reagent for the speci-men. This procedure may be repeated again with theanus. Such swab tests are used to check for gonorrheaand chlamydia, or bacterial vaginitis, which is a bacterialinfection resulting in inflammation of the vagina.\\nFollowing the Pap smear is the bimanual examina-\\ntion during which the examiner will place an index and\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2517Pelvic exam\\nRectumBladder\\nCervixUterus\\nSpeculum\\nDuring a pelvic exam, cells from the cervix are scraped on a spatula and are tested for abnormalacies.

The cervix willthen be palpated in order to note its shape, consistency,mobility, and any tenderness. The examiner will thenplace his or her other hand on the abdomen and gentlypush down while pushing the cervix up. This is done toassess the size and shape of the uterus, and also to noteany tenderness or abnormal lesions. During this time, theovaries are also checked for any masses, or tenderness.\\nThe last part of the pelvic exam is the rectovaginal\\nexamination. This allows the clinician to better examinethe pelvic organs and structures. The examiner will placetheir index finger into the vagina and a lubricated, glovedmiddle finger against the anus. During this part, thepatient may feel an urgency to have a bowel movement.However, this is a natural feeling and a bowel movementwill not occur. The patient will then be asked to straindown in order for the anal sphincter to relax. As relax-ation occurs the examiner will insert the middle fingerinto the rectum, enabling the position and shape of theuterus to be better assessed. In addition, any masses ortenderness can be evaluated at this point. The anal canaland rectum can also be examined for any polyps, or otherlesions at this time. After the rectovaginal exam, thepatient will be allowed clean off any excess lubricant andget dressed.

Even though sometests cannot be done on a menstruating patient, an exami-nation can still be performed. Any tampons should beremoved prior to the exam. Douching is not recommend-ed before an exam due to the hazard of washing awaycells that are needed for examination. If a Pap smear is tobe done, the patients should also refrain from sexualintercourse or using vaginal suppositories for 24 to 48hours prior to the exam. The patient will be asked toundress and put on a gown. The examiner will instructthe patient to lie on the examination table on her backand may assist her in putting her feet in stirrups.

Discharge may also be noted in yeast infec-tions. Other abnormal findings of the external genitaliainclude carcinomas, vulvar tumors, or hematomas.Hematomas are masses of accumulated blood thatappears as a bluish swelling of the labium that mayoccur following trauma to this area.

All ofthese will require further evaluation in order to deter-mine the underlying cause.\\nSince Pap smears screen for cervical cancer, abnor-\\nmal results require special attention. Due to the inci-dence of false-positives or false-negatives, the test maybe repeated or the physician may choose to have thepatient undergo a colposcopy . This procedure uses an\\nendoscope and will examine the vagina and cervix inmore depth. This will identify 100% of lesions present.A biopsy may then be taken of the lesion in order todetermine the exact type of abnormality. Several newtechniques are now available that improve the accuracyof the Pap smear including automated analysismachines. Bimanual and rectovaginal exams may revealabnormalities of the uterus or other pelvic structures.One commonly encountered finding is a myoma, whichis a benign uterine tumor. In addition, the uterus may bepositioned abnormally by being angled too far forwardor backward. Ovarian cysts and tumors, as well as\\nsome disorders of the fallopian tubes, can be findings ofthese two exams.Resources\\nBOOKS\\nBates, Barbara, et al.

The pelvis consists of thepubis, ilium, and ischium bones (among others) heldtogether by tough ligaments. With a cavity in its center,the pelvis forms one major ring and two smaller rings ofbone that support and protect internal organs such as thebladder, intestines, and rectum. In women, the pelvis alsosurrounds the uterus and vagina. The pelvis is wider andhas a larger cavity in females than in males because itmust accommodate childbirth .\\nFractures of the pelvis are uncommon, accounting\\nfor only 0.3–6% of all fractures. Pelvic rings often breakin more than one place. Pelvic fractures range widely in\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2519Pelvic fracture'),\n",

Disruption of the major ring is usually a severe\\ninjury while disruption of a minor ring is often not seri-ous. A mild fracture (for example, one that occurs due tothe impact of jogging) may heal in several weeks withoutsurgery. However, a serious pelvic fracture can be a life-threatening event requiring emergency medical care andlengthy rehabilitation . The latter type of injury may\\ninvolve damage to nearby internal organs.\\nPelvic fractures are classified as stable or unstable,\\nand as open or closed. A stable fracture is one in whichthe pelvis remains stable and involves one break-point inthe pelvic ring with minimal hemorrhage. An unstablefracture is one in which the pelvis is unstable with two ormore break-points in the pelvic ring with moderate tosevere hemorrhage. All types of pelvic fractures are fur-ther divided into ‘open’ or ‘closed,’ depending onwhether open skin wounds are present or not in the\\nlower abdomen.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMost pelvic fractures occur during high-speed acci-\\ndents (such as car or motorcycle crashes) or falls fromgreat heights. The greater the force, the greater theopportunity for a severe fracture. Pelvic fractures canalso occur spontaneously or after minor falls in peoplewith bone-weakening diseases such as osteoporosis .\\nLess commonly, pelvic fractures may occur during ath-letic activities such as football, hockey, skiing, and long-distance running.\\nThe primary symptom of a pelvic fracture is pain in\\nthe groin, hip, or lower back, which may worsen whenwalking or moving the legs. Other symptoms mayinclude abdominal pain; numbness/tingling in the groinor legs; bleeding from the vagina, urethra (urine tube), orrectum; difficulty urinating; and difficulty walking orstanding. A stress fracture that occurs while jogging maycause pain in the thigh or buttock.\\nDiagnosis\\nA pelvic fracture is typically diagnosed by an emer-\\ngency physician looking for bone tenderness, limitationsof movement, difficulty walking, and any loss of nervefunction in the lower part of the body. In addition, thephysician looks for signs of injury to nearby organs ofthe intestinal or genitourinary systems. This search mayinclude checking the rectum, vagina, and urethra forsigns of bleeding. The physician will order a plain x rayof the pelvis; this will usually detect the presence of afracture. Blood and urine tests may also be done. A com-puted tomography (CT) scan will be performed in com-plicated cases. Depending on the severity of the fracture,other imaging procedures may be required as well, such\\nas contrasting studies involving the injection of a radioac-tive dye; the pictures can be used to evaluate organs andstructures in the pelvic area, such as the urethra, bladder,and blood vessels.\\nTreatment\\nIn the case of a potentially serious pelvic fracture\\n(such as that occurring after an accident or high fall),emergency assistance should be summoned. The personwith the injury should be covered with a blanket or jacket(to maintain body heat), and should not be moved bynon-trained personnel, especially if there is severe painor signs of possible nerve injury.\\nTreatment depends on the severity of the injury. In\\nthe case of a minor fracture, treatment may consist of bedrest and over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription painkillers. Physical therapy, the use of crutches, and surgerymay also be recommended. Healing can take anywherefrom a few weeks to several months.\\nSevere injuries to the pelvis (such as those involving\\nmore than one break) can be life threatening, resulting inshock , extensive internal bleeding, and damage to internal\\norgans. In these situations, the immediate goal is to controlthe bleeding and stabilize the injured person’s condition.Resuscitation procedures may be required as well as largeamounts of intravenous fluids and blood transfusions ifinternal bleeding is present. These injuries often requireextensive surgery as well as lengthy rehabilitation.\\nAlternative treatment\\nTo speed up the healing process, some practitioners\\nof alternative medicine recommend magnetic field ther-\\napy, hydrogen peroxide therapy, calcium, vitamin D, vit-\\namin B complex, and zinc.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for minor pelvic fractures is excel-\\nlent, with most people gaining full mobility in a matter ofweeks or months. Severe pelvic fractures can be fatal dueto internal bleeding or damage to nearby organs, or resultin chronic pain and physical disabilities.\\nPrevention\\nPeople with bone-weakening conditions such as\\nosteoporosis or cancer , or tendencies to fall are more vul-\\nnerable to bone fractures. They should follow their treat-ment regimens and make use of canes and other walkingaids as well as safety devices in the home (bars, non skid-ding mats) and avoid climbing up, even on a small stool.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2520Pelvic fracture'),\n",

The upper female genital tract consists of thebody of the uterus, the fallopian or uterine tubes, and theovaries.\\nDescription\\nPID is the most common and the most serious con-\\nsequence of infection with sexually transmitted dis-\\neases (STD) in women. Over one million cases of PID\\nare diagnosed annually in the United States, and it is themost common cause for hospitalization of reproductive-age women. Sexually active women aged 15–25 are athighest risk for developing PID. The disease can alsooccur, although less frequently, in women havingmonogamous sexual relationships. The most serious con-sequences of PID are increased risk of infertility and\\nectopic pregnancy .\\nTo understand PID, it is helpful to understand the\\nbasics of inflammation. Inflammation is the body’sresponse to disease-causing (pathogenic) microorgan-isms. The affected body part may swell due to accumula-tion of fluid in the tissue or may become reddened due toan excessive accumulation of blood. A discharge (pus)may be produced that consists of white blood cells anddead tissue. Following inflammation, scar tissue mayform by the proliferation of scar-forming cells and iscalled fibrosis. Adhesions of fibrous tissue form andcause organs or parts of organs to stick together.\\nPID may be used synonymously with the following\\nterms:\\n• salpingitis (Inflammation of the fallopian tubes)• endometritis (Inflammation of the inside lining of the\\nbody of the uterus)\\n• tubo-ovarian abscesses (Abscesses in the tubes and\\novaries)\\n• pelvic peritonitis (Inflammation inside of the abdomi-\\nnal cavity surrounding the female reproductive organs)\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA number of factors affect the risk of developing\\nPID. They include:\\n• Age. The incidence of PID is very high in younger\\nwomen and decreases as a woman ages.\\n• Race. The incidence of PID is 8–10 times higher in\\nnonwhites than in whites.\\n• Socioeconomic status.

Induced abortion, use of an IUD , non-\\nuse of barrier contraceptives such as condoms, and fre-quent douching are all associated with a higher risk ofdeveloping PID.\\n• Lifestyle. High risk behaviors, such as drug and alcohol\\nabuse, early age of first intercourse, number of sexualpartners, and smoking all are associated with a higher\\nrisk of developing PID.\\n• Types of sexual practices. Intercourse during menses\\nand frequent intercourse may offer more opportunitiesfor the admission of pathogenic organisms to the insideof the uterus.\\n• Disease. Sixty to 75% of cases of PID are associated\\nwith STDs. A prior episode of PID increases thechances of developing subsequent infections.\\nThe two major causes of STDs are the organisms\\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis . The\\nmain symptom of N. gonorrheae infection ( gonorrhea )\\nis a vaginal discharge of mucus and pus. Sometimes bac-teria from the colon normally in the vaginal cavity maytravel upward to infect the upper female genital organs,facilitated by the infection with gonorrhea. Infectionswith C. trachomatis and other nongonoccal organisms\\nare more likely to have mild or no symptoms.\\nNormally, the cervix produces mucus which acts as a\\nbarrier to prevent disease-causing microorganisms, calledpathogens, from entering the uterus and moving upwardto the tubes and ovaries. This barrier may be breached intwo ways. A sexually transmitted pathogen, usually a sin-gle organism, invades the lining cells, alters them, andgains entry. Another way for organisms to gain entry hap-pens when trauma or alteration to the cervix occurs.Childbirth , spontaneous or induced abortion, or use of anintrauterine contraceptive device (IUD) are all conditions\\nthat may alter or weaken the normal lining cells, makingthem susceptible to infection, usually by several organ-isms. During menstruation, the cervix widens and mayallow pathogens entry into the uterine cavity.\\nRecent evidence suggests that bacterial vaginosis\\n(BV), a bacterial infection of the vagina, may be associ-ated with PID. BV results from the alteration of the bal-ance of normal organisms in the vagina, by douching, forexample. While the balance is altered, conditions areformed that favor the overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria,which thrive in the absence of free oxygen. A copiousdischarge is usually present. Should some trauma occurin the presence of anaerobic bacteria, such as menses,abortion, intercourse, or childbirth, these organisms maygain entrance to the upper genital organs.\\nThe most common symptom of PID is pelvic pain .\\nHowever, many women with PID have symptoms somild that they may be unaware that an infection exists.\\nIn acute salpingitis, a common form of PID,\\nswelling of the fallopian tubes may cause tenderness onphysical examination . Fever may be present. Abscesses\\nmay develop in the tubes, ovaries, or in the surroundingpelvic cavity. Infectious discharge may leak into the peri-toneal cavity and cause peritonitis, or abscesses may rup-ture causing a life-threatening surgical emergency.\\nChronic salpingitis may follow an acute attack. Sub-\\nsequent to inflammation, scarring and resulting adhe-sions may result in chronic pain and irregular menses.Due to blockage of the tubes by scar tissue, women withchronic salpingitis are at high risk of having an ectopicpregnancy . The fertilized ovum is unable to travel down\\nthe fallopian tube to the uterus and implants itself in thetube, on the ovary, or in the peritoneal cavity. This condi-tion can also be a life-threatening surgical emergency.\\nIUD\\nIUD usage has been strongly associated with the\\ndevelopment of PID. Bacteria may be introduced to theuterine cavity while the IUD is being inserted or maytravel up the tail of the IUD from the cervix into theuterus. Uterine tissue in association with the IUD showsareas of inflammation that may increase its susceptibilityto pathogens.\\nSusceptibility to STDs\\nSusceptibility to STDs involves many factors, some\\nof which are not known. The ability of the organism toproduce disease and the circumstances that place theorganism in the right place at a time when a trauma oralteration to the lining cells has occurred are factors.

Two blood tests may help to establish the exis-tence of an inflammatory process.

If acute salpingitis is suspected, treat-ment with antibiotics should begin immediately. Early\\nintervention is crucial to keep the fallopian tubes undam-aged. The patient is usually treated with at least twobroad spectrum antibiotics that can kill both N. gonor-\\nrhoeae and C. trachomatis plus other types of bacteria\\nthat may have the potential to cause infection.

Wells\\nPelvic relaxation\\nDefinition\\nPelvic relaxation is a weakening of the supportive\\nmuscles and ligaments of the pelvic floor. This condition,which affects women and is usually caused by childbirth,aging, and problems with support, causes the pelvic floorto sag and press into the wall of the vagina.\\nDescription\\nThe pelvic floor normally holds the uterus and the\\nbladder in position above the vagina. When the pelvic floorbecomes stretched and damaged, these organs can sag intothe vagina, sometimes bulging out through the vaginalopening. A sagging uterus is referred to as a uterine pro-lapse, pelvic floor hernia , or pudendal hernia. A sagging\\nbladder is referred to as a bladder prolapse, or cystocele.Other organs, such as the rectum and intestine, can also saginto the vagina as a result of a weakened pelvic floor.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nChildbirth increases the risk of pelvic relaxation.\\nOther causes include constipation , a chronic cough ,\\nobesity , and heavy lifting. Some women develop the\\ncondition after menopause , when the body loses the\\nestrogen that helps maintain muscle tone. Mild pelvicrelaxation may cause no symptoms. More severe pelvicrelaxation can cause the following symptoms:\\n• an aching sensation in the vagina, lower abdomen,\\ngroin or lower back\\n• heaviness or pressure in the vaginal area, as if some-\\nthing is about to “fall out” of the vagina\\n• bladder control problems that worsen with heavy lift-\\ning, coughing, or sneezing\\n• frequent urinary tract infections\\n• difficulty having a bowel movement\\nDiagnosis\\nA thorough pelvic exam can help diagnose pelvic\\nrelaxation, as can tests of bladder function.\\nTreatment\\nExercises called Kegel exercises can strengthen\\npelvic floor muscles and lessen the symptoms of pelvicrelaxation. These exercises involve squeezing the mus-cles that stop the flow of urine. The pelvic floor can alsobe strengthened by estrogen supplements. Physicianssometimes prescribe the insertion of a supportive ring-shaped device called a pessary into the vagina, to preventthe uterus and bladder from pressing into the vagina.Sometimes surgery is recommended to repair a saggingbladder or uterus, and sometimes surgical removal of theuterus ( hysterectomy ) is recommended.

These waves reflect off of the internal struc-tures and create shadowy black and white pictures on adisplay screen.\\nPurpose\\nUltrasound is performed routinely during pregnan-\\ncy. Early in the pregnancy (at about seven weeks), it\\nmight be used to determine the size of the uterus or thefetus, to detect multiple or ectopic pregnancy , to con-\\nfirm that the fetus is alive (or viable), or to confirm thedue date. Toward the middle of the pregnancy (at about16–20 weeks), ultrasound may be used to confirm fetalgrowth, to reveal defects in the anatomy of the fetus, andto check the placenta. Toward the end of pregnancy, itmay be used to evaluate fetal size, position, growth, or tocheck the placenta. Doctors may use ultrasound duringdiagnostic procedures like amniocentesis and chorionic\\nvillus sampling . Both of these tests use long needles\\ninserted through the mother’s abdomen into the uterus orplacenta to gather cells. Ultrasound can also be used inmen or women to examine other internal organs, such asthe liver, gallbladder, kidney, and heart. The procedurecan be useful in detecting cysts, tumors, and cancer of\\nthe uterus, ovaries, and breasts.\\nPrecautions\\nThere are no special precautions recommended\\nbefore an ultrasound examination. Unlike x rays, ultra-sound does not produce any harmful radiation and doesnot pose a risk to the mother or the fetus.

Gel or oil is applied to the area. The doctor ortechnician will move a hand-held scanner (called a trans-ducer) over the abdomen. The transducer emits high-fre-quency sound waves (usually in the range of 3.5–7.0megahertz) into the abdomen. The waves are reflectedback to the transducer and the wave patterns are shown asan image on a display screen. An ultrasound scan revealsthe shapes, densities, and even movements of organs andtissues. Although the pictures transmitted by an ultra-sound scan appear gray and grainy, a trained techniciancan identify the fetus within the uterus, monitor its heart-beat, and sometimes determine its sex. Using computer-ized tools, the technician can measure various structuresshown on the screen. For example, the length of the upperthigh bone (femur) or the distance between the two sidesof the skull can indicate the age of the fetus.\\nUltrasound technology has been used safely in med-\\nical settings for over 30 years, and several significantimprovements have been made to the procedure. A spe-cially designed transducer probe can be placed in thevagina to provide better ultrasound images. This trans-vaginal or endovaginal scan is particularly useful in earlypregnancy or in cases where ectopic pregnancy is sus-pected. Doppler ultrasound uses enhanced sound waves\\nto monitor subtle events, like the flow of fetal bloodthrough the heart and arteries. Color imaging is a recentaddition to ultrasound technology. With this process,color can be assigned to the various shades of gray forbetter visualization of subtle tissue details. A new tech-nology under development is three-dimensional ultra-sound, which has the potential for detecting even verysubtle fetal defects.\\nPreparation\\nBefore undergoing a pelvic ultrasound, a woman\\nmay be asked to drink several glasses of water and toavoid urinating for about one hour before the examina-tion.

Penile cancer is more common in other parts of theworld, particularly Africa and Asia. In Uganda, penilecancer is the most common form of cancer for men.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of penile cancer is unknown. The most\\ncommon symptoms of penile cancer are:\\n• a tender spot, an open sore, or a wart-like lump on the\\npenis\\n• unusual liquid discharges from the penis\\n• pain or bleeding in the genital area\\nDiagnosis\\nIn order to diagnose penile cancer, the doctor exam-\\nines the patient’s penis for lumps or other abnormalities.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2529Penile cancer'),\n",

If the\\nresults confirm a diagnosis of cancer, additional tests aredone to determine whether the disease has spread toother parts of the body.\\nTreatment\\nIn Stage I penile cancer, malignant cells are found\\nonly on the surface of the head (glans) and on the foreskinof the penis. If the cancer is limited to the foreskin, treat-ment may involve wide local excision and circumcision .\\nWide local excision is a form of surgery that removesonly cancer cells and a small amount of normal tissueadjacent to them. Circumcision is removal of the foreskin.\\nIf the Stage I cancer is only on the glans, treatment\\nmay involve the use of a fluorouracil cream (Adrucil,Efudex), and/or microsurgery. Microsurgery removescancerous tissue and the smallest possible amount of nor-mal tissue. During microsurgery, the doctor uses a specialinstrument that provides a comprehensive view of thearea where cancer cells are located and makes it possibleto determine that all malignant cells have been removed.\\nIn Stage II, the penile cancer has spread to the sur-\\nface of the glans, tissues beneath the surface, and theshaft of the penis. The treatment recommended may beamputation of all or part of the penis (total or partial\\npenectomy). If the disease is diagnosed early enough,surgeons are often able to preserve enough of the organfor urination and sexual activity. Treatment may alsoinclude microsurgery and external radiation therapy ,i n\\nwhich a machine provides radiation to the affected area.Laser surgery is an experimental treatment for Stage II\\ncancers. Laser surgery uses an intense precisely focusedbeam of light to dissolve or burn away cancer cells.\\nIn Stage III, malignant cells have spread to lymph\\nnodes in the groin, where they cause swelling. The rec-ommended treatment may include amputation of thepenis and removal of the lymph nodes on both sides.Radiation therapy may also be suggested. Moreadvanced disease requires systemic treatments usingdrugs ( chemotherapy ). In chemotherapy, medicines are\\nadministered intravenously or taken by mouth.

Biological therapy is a type of treatment that issometimes called biological response modifier (BRM)therapy. It uses natural or artificial substances to boost,focus, or reinforce the body’s disease-fighting resources.\\nPrevention\\nConditions which increase a person’s chance of get-\\nting penile cancer include:\\n• infection with genital warts (human papillomavirus, or\\nHPV)\\n• a skin disease called psoriasis• a condition called phimosis, in which the foreskin be-\\ncomes difficult to retract\\n• other conditions that result in repeated irritation of the\\npenis\\n• a history of smoking\\nThere appears to be a connection between develop-\\nment of the disease and lack of personal hygiene.

Blood pressure fills andhardens the compartments producing an erection of suffi-cient firmness to perform sexual intercourse. Additionalstimulation leads to ejaculation, where semen is pumpedout of the urethra. When this system fails, impotence(failure to create and maintain an erection) occurs.\\nImpotence can be caused by a number of conditions,\\nincluding diabetes, spinal cord injury , prolonged drug\\nabuse, and removal of a prostate gland. If the medical con-dition is irreversible, a penile prosthesis may be consid-ered. Patients whose impotence is caused by psychologicalproblems are not recommended for implant surgery.\\nDescription\\nPenile implant surgery is conducted on patients who\\nhave exhausted all other areas of treatment.

Once\\nimplanted, the semirigid device needs no follow-upadjustments, however it produces a penis which con-stantly remains semi-erect. The inflatable cylinders pro-duce a more natural effect. The patient is able to simulatean erection by using a pump located in the scrotum.\\nWith the patient asleep under general anesthesia, the\\ndevice is inserted into the erectile tissue of the penisthrough an incision in the fibrous wall. In order toimplant the pump for the inflatable implant, incisions aremade in the abdomen and the perineum (area betweenthe anus and the genitals).

A perforatedeardrum may cause temporary hearing loss and occa-\\nsional discharge.\\nDescription\\nThe eardrum (tympanic membrane) is a thin wall\\nthat separates the outer ear from the middle ear, vibratingwhen sound waves strike the membrane. The middle earis connected to the nose by the Eustachian tube.\\nIn addition to conducting sound, the eardrum also\\nprotects the middle ear from bacteria. When it is perfo-rated, bacteria can more easily get into this part of theear, causing ear infections.\\nIn general, the larger the hole in the eardrum, the\\ngreater the temporary loss of hearing. The location of theperforation also affects the degree of hearing loss. Severehearing loss may follow a skull fracture that disrupts thebones in the middle ear. Eardrum perforation caused by aloud noise may result in ringing in the ear ( tinnitus ), in\\naddition to a temporary hearing loss. Over time, thishearing loss improves and the ringing usually fades in afew days.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe eardrum can become damaged by a direct\\ninjury.

Cocaine is a potent vasoconstrictor,\\nwhich means that it causes small blood vessels to close.It is used in nose surgery because it shrinks mucusmembranes, permitting better visualization and accessinto the nose. Used continuously, tissues are deprivedof blood and die. The nasal septum is the most vulnera-ble to this effect of sniffing cocaine.\\n• Getting the septum cauterized. Nosebleeds usually come\\nfrom the front part of the nasal septum, which is rich inblood vessels. Uncontrolled repeated bleeding fromthese vessels may require cautery—burning the vesselswith electricity or chemicals to close them off. Injudi-cious cautery of both sides of the septum has in the pastled to death of tissue and consequent perforation.\\n• More and more people are having cosmetic surgery\\ndone on their nose. The procedure, called rhinoplasty ,\\noccasionally damages the septum’s blood supply.\\n• Contracting certain diseases. Several diseases—\\ntyphoid, syphilis ,systemic lupus erythematosus , and\\ntuberculosis—can infect this tissue and destroy it.\\n• Being exposed to harmful vapors. Toxic air pollutant-like\\nacid fumes, phosphorus, and copper vapor—and some-times even cortisone sprays—can destroy nasal tissue.\\nPerforation is not serious. It causes irritation, mostly\\ncomplaints of dryness and crusting. Sometimes air blowingpast it whistles. Picking at the crusts can cause bleeding.\\nTreatment\\nSurgical repair is not difficult. The surgeon may\\ndevise a plastic button that fits exactly into the defect andstays in place like a collar button.\\nAlternative treatment\\nSaline nasal sprays may be sufficient to control\\nsymptoms and prevent the need for surgery.\\nPrevention\\nNosebleeds from the septum can usually be con-\\ntrolled with pinching.

Iftime allows, sedation is administered, the puncture site\\nis cleaned with an antiseptic iodine solution, and a localanesthetic is injected into the skin to numb the area. Thepatient is instructed to remain still. The physician per-forming pericardiocentesis will insert a syringe with anattached cardiac needle slowly into the chest wall untilthe needle tip reaches the pericardial sac. The patientmay experience a sensation of pressure as the needleenters the membrane. When the needle is in the correctposition, the physician will aspirate, or withdraw, fluidfrom the pericardial sac.\\nWhen the procedure is performed for diagnostic pur-\\nposes, the fluid will be collected into specimen tubes forlaboratory analysis. If the pericardiocentesis is per-formed to treat a cardiac tamponade or other significantfluid build-up, a pericardial catheter may be attached tothe needle to allow for continuous drainage.\\nAfter the cardiac needle is removed, pressure is\\napplied to the puncture site for approximately five min-utes, and the site is then bandaged.\\nPreparation\\nPrior to pericardiocentesis, the test procedure is\\nexplained to the patient, along with the risks and possiblecomplications involved, and the patient is asked to signan informed consent form.

It affects approximate-\\nly one in 1,000 people. The most common form is causedby infection with a virus. People in their 20s and 30s whohave had a recent upper respiratory infection are mostlikely to be affected, along with men aged 20–50. One outof every four people who have had pericarditis will get itagain, but after two years these relapses are less likely.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe viruses that cause pericarditis include those that\\ncause influenza ,polio , and rubella (German measles ). In\\nchildren, the most common viruses that cause pericarditisare the adenovirus and the cocksackievirus (which is mostlikely to affect children during warmer weather).\\nAlthough pericarditis is usually caused by a virus, it\\nalso can be caused by an injury to the heart or it can fol-low a heart attack . It may also be caused by certain\\ninflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or\\nsystemic lupus erythematosus . Bacteria, fungi, para-\\nsites, tuberculosis ,cancer or kidney failure may also\\naffect the pericardium. Sometimes the cause is unknown.There are several forms of pericarditis, depending on\\nthe cause.\\nAcute pericarditis\\nThis is caused by infection with a virus, bacteria, or\\nfungus—usually in the lungs and upper respiratory tract.This form of the disease causes a sharp, severe pain that\\nstarts in the region of the breastbone. If the pericarditis iscaused by a bacteria, it is called bacterial or purulentpericarditis.\\nCardiac tamponade\\nSometimes fluid collects between the heart and the\\npericardium. This is called pericardial effusion, and maylead to a condition called cardiac tamponade . When the\\nfluid accumulates, it can squeeze the heart and prevent itfrom filling with blood. This keeps the rest of the bodyfrom getting the necessary supply of oxygen and cancause dangerously low blood pressure. A cardiac tam-ponade can happen when the chest is injured duringsurgery, radiation therapy , or an accident. Cardiac tam-\\nponade is a serious medical emergency and must betreated immediately.\\nConstrictive pericarditis\\nWhen the pericardium is scarred or thickened, the\\nheart has difficulty contracting. This is because the peri-cardium has shrunken or tightened around the heart, con-stricting the muscle’s heart movement. This usuallyoccurs as a result of tuberculosis, which now is rarely\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2538Pericarditis'),\n",

This sound occurs because the roughenedpericardium surfaces are rubbing against each other.\\nThe following tests will also help diagnose peri-\\ncarditis and what is causing it:\\n• electrocardiograph (ECG) and echocardiogram to dis-\\ntinguish between pericarditis and a heart attack\\n• x ray to show the traditional “water bottle” shadow\\naround the heart that is often seen in pericarditis wherethere is sufficient fluid buildup\\n• computed tomography scan (CT scan) of the chest• heart catheterization to view the heart’s chambers and\\nvalves\\n•pericardiocentesis to test for viruses, bacteria, fungus,\\ncancer, and tuberculosis\\n• blood tests such as LDH and CPK to measure cardiac\\nenzymes and distinguish between a heart attack andpericarditis, as well as a complete blood count (CBC)\\nto look for infectionKEY TERMS\\nComputed tomography (CT) scan —A CT scan\\nuses x rays to scan the body from many angles. Acomputer compiles the x rays into a picture of thearea being studied.

A tube(catheter) is inserted into an artery, usually in thegroin. A dye is then put into the artery through thetube. The dye makes its way to the heart to create animage of the heart on x-ray film. The image is pho-tographed and stored for further examination.\\nPericardiocentesis —Pericardiocentesis is a proce-\\ndure used to test for viruses, bacteria, and fungus.The physician puts a small tube through the skin,directly into the pericardial sac, and withdrawsfluid.

It has two lay-ers: the serous pericardium and the fibrous peri-cardium.\\nTreatment\\nSince most pericarditis is caused by a virus and will\\nheal naturally, there is no specific, curative treatment.Ordinary antibiotics do not work against viruses. Peri-\\ncarditis that comes from a virus usually clears up in twoweeks to three months. Medications may be used toreduce inflammation, however. They include nons-\\nteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as\\nibuprofen and aspirin . Corticosteroids are helpful if the\\npericarditis was caused by a heart attack or systemiclupus erythematosus.

Maternal infection can, insome cases, cause complications at birth. The mothermay or may not experience active symptoms of the infec-tion during the pregnancy. The most serious and mostcommon perinatal infections, and the impact of these dis-eases on the mother and infant, are discussed below inalphabetical order. It is important to note that men canbecome infected and can transmit many of these infec-tions to other women. The sexual partners of women whohave these infections should also seek medical treatment.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nChlamydia\\nChlamydia trachomatis is the most common bacteri-\\nal sexually transmitted disease in the United States, caus-ing more than 4 million infections each year. The majori-ty of women with chlamydial infection experience noobvious symptoms. The infection affects the reproduc-tive tract and causes pelvic inflammatory disease ,\\ninfertility , and ectopic pregnancy (the fertilized egg\\nimplants somewhere other than in the uterus). This infec-tion can cause premature rupture of the membranes andearly labor. It can be passed to the infant during deliveryand can cause ophthalmia neonatorum (an eye infection)within the first month of life and pneumonia within one\\nto three months of age. Symptoms of chlamydial pneu-\\nmonia are a repetitive cough and rapid breathing.\\nWheezing is rare and the infant does not develop a fever .\\nCytomegalovirus\\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) is a very common virus in\\nthe herpes virus family. It is found in saliva, urine, andother body fluids and can be spread through sexual con-tact or other more casual forms of physical contact likekissing. In adults, CMV may cause mild symptoms ofswollen lymph glands, fever, and fatigue . Many people\\nwho carry the virus experience no symptoms at all.Infants can become infected with CMV while still in theuterus if the mother becomes infected or develops a recur-rence of the infection during pregnancy. Most infantsexposed to CMV before birth develop normally and donot show any symptoms. As many as 6,000 infants whowere exposed to CMV before birth are born with seriouscomplications each year. CMV interferes with normalfetal development and can cause mental retardation ,\\nblindness, deafness, or epilepsy in these infants.\\nGenital herpes\\nGenital herpes , which is usually caused by herpes\\nsimplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), is a sexually transmitted\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2540Perinatal infection'),\n",

Women\\nwho have their first outbreak of genital herpes duringpregnancy are at high risk of miscarriage or delivering a\\nlow birth weight baby. The infection can be passed to theinfant at the time of delivery if the mother has an activesore. The most serious risk to the infant is the possibilityof developing HSV-2 encephalitis , an inflammation of\\nthe brain, with symptoms of irritability and poor feeding.\\nHepatitis B\\nHepatitis B is a contagious virus that causes liver\\ndamage and is a leading cause of chronic liver diseaseand cirrhosis . Approximately 20,000 infants are born\\neach year to mothers who test positive for the hepatitis Bvirus. These infants are at high risk for developinghepatitis B infection through exposure to their mothersblood during delivery.\\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a serious,\\ncontagious virus which causes acquired immunodefi-ciency syndrome ( AIDS ). About one-fourth of pregnant\\nwomen with HIV pass the infection on to their newborninfants. An infant with HIV usually develops AIDS anddies before the age of two.\\nHuman papillomavirus\\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) is a sexually transmitted\\ndisease that causes genital warts and can increase the risk\\nof developing some cancers. HPV appears to be transferredfrom the mother to the infant during the birth process.\\nRubella (German measles)\\nRubella is a virus that causes German measles, an\\nillness that includes rash, fever, and symptoms of anupper respiratory tract infection. Most people areexposed to rubella during childhood and develop anti-bodies to the virus so they will never get it again. Rubellainfection during early pregnancy can pass through theplacenta to the developing infant and cause serious birth\\ndefects including heart abnormalities, mental retarda-\\ntion, blindness, and deafness.\\nStreptococcus\\nGroup B streptococcus (GBS) infection is the most\\ncommon bacterial cause of infection and death in new-\\nborn infants. In women, GBS can cause vaginitis and uri-nary tract infections. Both infections can cause prema-ture birth and the bacteria can be transferred to the infantin the uterus or during delivery. GBS causes pneumonia,meningitis , and other serious infections in infants.Syphilis\\nSyphilis is a sexually transmitted bacterial infec-\\ntion that can be transferred from a mother to an infantthrough the placenta before birth. Up to 50% of infantsborn to mothers with syphilis will be premature, still-born, or will die shortly after birth. Infected infants mayhave severe birth defects. Those infants who surviveinfancy may develop symptoms of syphilis up to twoyears later.\\nDiagnosis\\nChlamydia\\nChlamydial bacteria can be diagnosed by taking a\\ncotton swab sample of the cervix and vagina during thethird trimester of the pregnancy. Chlamydial cell culturestake three to seven days to grow but many laboratoriesare not equipped to run the tests necessary to confirm thediagnosis.\\nCtyomegalovirus\\nPast or recent infection with CMV can be identified\\nby antibody tests and CMV can be grown from bodyfluids.\\nGenital herpes\\nThe appearance of a genital sore is enough to sus-\\npect an outbreak of genital herpes. The sore can be cul-tured and tested to confirm that HSV-2 is present.\\nHepatitis B\\nA blood test can be used to screen pregnant women\\nfor the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in prenatalhealth programs.\\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\\nHIV can be detected using a blood test and is part of\\nmost prenatal screening programs.\\nHuman papillomavirus\\nHPV causes the growth of warts in the genital\\narea. The wart tissue can be removed with a scalpel andtested to determine what type of HPV virus caused theinfection.\\nRubella (German measles)\\nPregnant women are usually tested for antibodies to\\nrubella, which would indicate that they have been previ-ously exposed to the virus and therefore would not devel-op infection during pregnancy if exposed.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2541Perinatal infection'),\n",

Newborn infants can betreated with erythromycin liquid for 10–14 days at adosage determined by their body weight.\\nCtyomegalovirus\\nNo drugs or vaccines are currently available for pre-\\nvention or treatment of CMV .\\nGenital herpes\\nThe antiviral drugs acyclovir or famciclovir can be\\nadministered to the mother during pregnancy. Little isknown about the risks of these drugs to the fetus, however,the risk of birth defects does not seem to be any higher thanfor women who do not take these medications. Infants withsuspected HSV-2 can be treated with acyclovir. Delivery ofthe infant by cesarean section is recommended if the\\nmother has an active case of genital herpes.\\nHepatitis B\\nInfants born to mothers who test positive to the\\nHBsAg test should be treated with hepatitis B immuneglobulin at birth to give them immediate protectionagainst developing hepatitis B. These infants, as well asall infants, should also receive a series of three hepatitis Bvaccine injections as part of their routine immunizations.\\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\\nPregnant women with HIV should be treated as early\\nin the pregnancy as possible with zidovudine (AZT).Other newer drugs designed to treat HIV/AIDS may alsobe used during pregnancy with the knowledge that thesedrugs may have unknown effects on the infant. The risksand benefits of such treatments need to be discussed.Infants born with HIV should receive aggressive drugtreatment to prevent development of AIDS.Human papillomavirus\\nGenital warts are very difficult to treat and frequent-\\nly reoccur even after treatment. They can be removed bycryotherapy (freezing), laser or electrocauterization\\n(burning), or surgical excision (cutting) of the warts.Some medications (imiquimod 5% cream, podophyllin,trichloroacetic acid or topical 5-fluorouracil) can beapplied to help dissolve genital warts. Cesarean deliveryrather than vaginal delivery seems to reduce the risk oftransmission of HPV from mothers to infants.\\nRubella (German measles)\\nNo treatment is available. Some health care providers\\nmay recommend giving the mother an injection ofimmune globulin (to boost the immune system to fight offthe virus) if she is exposed to rubella early in the pregnan-cy. However, no evidence to support the use of theseinjections exists. Exposure to rubella early in pregnancyposes a high risk that the infant will have serious birthdefects. Termination of the pregnancy may be considered.Women who have not been previously exposed to rubellawill usually be vaccinated immediately after the firstpregnancy to protect infants of future pregnancies.\\nStreptococcus\\nPregnant women diagnosed with GBS late in the\\npregnancy should be treated with antibiotics injected\\nintravenously to prevent premature labor . If transmis-\\nsion of GBS to the newborn infant is suspected or if thebaby develops symptoms of infection, infants can betreated with antibiotics.\\nSyphilis\\nAntibiotic therapy, usually penicillin, given early in\\nthe pregnancy can be used to treat the infection and mayprevent transmission to the infant.\\nPrognosis\\nChlamydia\\nWithout treatment, the most serious consequences of\\nchlamydial infection are related to complications of pre-mature delivery.

There are two major forms,hypokalemic and hyperkalemic, each caused by defectsin different genes.\\nIn hypokalemic PP, the level of potassium in the\\nblood falls in the early stages of a paralytic attack, whilein hyperkalemic PP, it rises slightly or is normal. (Theroot of both words, “kali,” refers to potassium.) Hyper-kalemic PP is also called potassium-sensitive PP.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nBoth forms of PP are caused by inheritance of defec-\\ntive genes. Both genes are dominant, meaning that onlyone copy of the defective gene is needed for a person todevelop the disease. A parent with the gene has a 50%chance of passing it along to each offspring, and the like-lihood of passing it on is unaffected by the results of pre-vious pregnancies.\\nThe gene for hypokalemic PP is present equally in\\nboth sexes, but leads to noticeable symptoms more oftenin men than in women. The normal gene is responsiblefor a muscle protein controlling the flow of calcium dur-ing muscle contraction.\\nThe gene for hyperkalemic PP affects virtually all\\nwho inherit it, with no difference in male-vs.-femaleexpression. The normal gene is responsible for a muscleprotein controlling the flow of sodium during musclecontraction.\\nSymptoms\\nThe attacks of weakness in hypokalemic PP usually\\nbegin in late childhood or early adolescence and oftenbecome less frequent during middle age. The majority ofpatients develop symptoms before age 16. Since theybegin in the school years, the symptoms of hypokalemicPP are often first seen during physical education classesor after-school sports, and may be mistaken for laziness,or lack of interest on the part of the child.\\nAttacks are most commonly brought on by:• strenuous exercise followed by a short period of rest\\n• large meals, especially ones rich in carbohydrates or\\nsalt\\n• emotional stress\\n• alcohol use• infection•pregnancy\\nThe weakness from a particular attack may last from\\nseveral hours to as long as several days, and may belocalized to a particular limb, or might involve the entirebody.\\nThe attacks of weakness of hyperkalemic PP usually\\nbegin in infancy or early childhood, and may becomeless severe later in life. As in the hypokalemic form,attacks are brought on by stress, pregnancy, and exercisefollowed by rest. In contrast, though, hyperkalemicattacks are not associated with a heavy meal but ratherwith missing a meal, with high potassium intake, or useof glucocorticoid drugs such as prednisone. (Glucocorti-coids are a group of steroids that regulate metabolismand affect muscle tone.)\\nWeakness usually lasts less than three hours, and\\noften persists for only several minutes. The attacks areusually less severe, but more frequent, than those of thehypokalemic form. Weakness usually progresses fromthe lower limbs to the upper, and may involve the facialmuscles as well.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of either form of PP begins with a careful\\nmedical history and a complete physical and neurologi-cal exam. A family medical history may reveal otheraffected relatives. Blood and urine tests done at the onsetof an attack show whether there are elevated or depressedlevels of potassium. Electrical tests of muscle and a mus-cle biopsy show characteristic changes.\\nChallenge tests, to aid in diagnosis, differ for the two\\nforms. In hypokalemic PP, an attack of weakness can bebrought on by administration of glucose and insulin, withexercise if necessary. An attack of hyperkalemic PP canbe induced with administration of potassium after exer-cise during fasting . These tests are potentially hazardous\\nand require careful monitoring.\\nGenetic tests are available at some research centers\\nand are usually recommended for patients with a knownfamily history. However, the number of different possiblemutations leading to each form is too great to allow a sin-gle comprehensive test for either form, thus limiting theusefulness of genetic testing .\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2544Periodic paralysis'),\n",

Leftuntreated, periodontal disease results in the destructionof the gums, alveolar bone (the part of the jaws where theteeth arise), and the outer layer of the tooth root.\\nDescription\\nPeriodontal disease is usually seen as a chronic\\ninflammatory disease. An acute infection of the periodon-tal tissue may occur, but is not usually reported to thedentist. The tissues that are involved in periodontal dis-eases are the gums, which include the gingiva, periodon-tal ligament, cementum, and alveolar bone. The gingiva isa pink-colored mucus membrane that covers parts of theteeth and the alveolar bone. The periodontal ligament isthe main part of the gums. The cementum is a calcifiedstructure that covers the lower parts of the teeth. The alve-olar bone is a set of ridges from the jaw bones (maxillaryand mandible) in which the teeth are embedded. The mainarea involved in periodontal disease is the gingival sulcus,a pocket between the teeth and the gums. Several distinctforms of periodontal disease are known. These are gin-givitis, acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, adult peri-odontitis, and localized juvenile periodontitis. Althoughperiodontal disease is thought to be widespread, seriouscases of periodontitis are not common. Gingivitis is alsoone of the early signs of leukemia in some children.\\nGingivitis\\nGingivitis is an inflammation of the outermost soft\\ntissue of the gums. The gingivae become red andinflamed, loose their normal shape, and bleed easily. Gin-givitis may remain a chronic disease for years withoutaffecting other periodontal tissues. Chronic gingivitismay lead to a deepening of the gingival sulcus. Acutenecrotizing ulcerative gingivitis is mainly seen in youngadults. This form of gingivitis is characterized by painful,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2545Periodontal disease'),\n",

It is thought that stress ,mal-\\nnutrition ,fatigue , and poor oral hygiene are among the\\ncauses for acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis.\\nAdult periodontitis\\nAdult periodontitis is the most serious form of the\\nperiodontal diseases. It involves the gingiva, periodontalligament, and alveolar bone. A deep periodontal pocketforms between the teeth, the cementum, and the gums.Plaque, calculus, and debris from food and other sourcescollect in the pocket. Without treatment, the periodontalligament can be destroyed and resorption of the alveolarbone occurs. This allows the teeth to move more freelyand eventually results in the loss of teeth. Most cases ofadult periodontitis are chronic, but some cases occur inepisodes or periods of tissue destruction.\\nLocalized juvenile periodontitis\\nLocalized juvenile periodontitis is a less common\\nform of periodontal disease and is seen mainly in youngpeople. Primarily, localized juvenile periodontitis affectsthe molars and incisors. Among the distinctions that sep-arate this form of periodontitis are the low incidence ofbacteria in the periodontal pocket, minimal plaque for-mation, and mild inflammation.\\nHerpetic gingivostomatitis\\nHerpes infection of the gums and other parts of the\\nmouth is called herpetic gingivostomatitis and is fre-quently grouped with periodontal diseases. The infectedareas of the gums turn red in color and have whitish her-petic lesions. There are two principal differencesbetween this form of periodontal diseases and most otherforms. Herpetic gingivostomatitis is caused by a virus,Herpes simplex, not by bacteria, and the viral infectiontends to heal by itself in approximately two weeks. Also,\\nherpetic gingivostomatitis is infectious to other peoplewho come in contact with the herpes lesions or salivathat contains virus from the lesion.\\nPericoronitis\\nPericoronitis is a condition found in children who\\nare in the process of producing molar teeth. The diseaseis seen more frequently in the lower molar teeth. As themolar emerges, a flap of gum still covers the tooth. Theflap of gum traps bacteria and food, leading to a mildirritation. If the upper molar fully emerges before thelower one, it may bite down on the flap during chewing.This can increase the irritation of the flap and lead to aninfection. In bad cases, the infection can spread to theneck and cheeks.\\nDesquamative gingivitis\\nDesquamative gingivitis occurs mainly in post-\\nmenopausal women. The cause of the disease is notunderstood. The outer layers of the gums slough off,leaving raw tissue and exposed nerves.\\nTrench mouth\\nTrench mouth is an acute, necrotizing (causing tissue\\ndeath), ulcerating (causing open sores) form of gingivitis.It causes pain in the affected gums. Fever and fatigue are\\nusually present also. Trench mouth, also known as Vin-cent’s disease, is a complication of mild cases of gingivi-tis. Frequently, poor oral hygiene is the main cause.Stress, an unbalanced diet, or lack of sleep are frequentcofactors in the development of trench mouth. This formof periodontal disease is more common in people whosmoke. The term “trench mouth” was created in WorldWar I, when the disease was common in soldiers wholived in the trenches. Symptoms of trench mouth appearsuddenly. The initial symptoms include painful gums andfoul breath. Gum tissue between teeth becomes infectedand dies, and starts to disappear. Often, what appears tobe remaining gum is dead tissue. Usually, the gums bleedeasily, especially when chewing. The pain can increase tothe point where eating and swallowing become difficult.Inflammation or infection from trench mouth can spreadto nearby tissues of the face and neck.\\nPeriodontitis\\nPeriodontitis is a condition in which gingivitis has\\nextended down around the tooth and into the supportingbone structure. Periodontitis is also called pyorrhea. Plaqueand tarter buildup sometimes lead to the formation of largepockets between the gums and teeth. When this happens,anaerobic bacteria grow in the pockets. The pockets even-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2546Periodontal disease\\nAn extreme case of juvenile periodontitis. (Custom Medical\\nStock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)'),\n",

The teeth become loose and tooth loss can result.Some medical conditions are associated with an increasedlikelihood of developing periodontitis. These diseasesinclude diabetes, Down syndrome , Cohn’s disease, AIDS ,\\nand any disease that reduces the number of white bloodcells in the body for extended periods of time.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSeveral factors play a role in the development of\\nperiodontal disease. The most important are age and oralhygiene. The number and type of bacteria present on thegingival tissues also play a role in the development ofperiodontal diseases. The presence of certain species ofbacteria in large enough numbers in the gingival pocketand related areas correlates with the development of peri-odontal disease. Also, removal of the bacteria correlateswith reduction or elimination of disease. In most cases ofperiodontal disease, the bacteria remain in the periodon-tal pocket and do not invade surrounding tissue.\\nThe mechanisms by which bacteria in the periodon-\\ntal pocket cause tissue destruction in the surroundingregion are not fully understood. Several bacterial prod-ucts that diffuse through tissue are thought to play a rolein disease formation. Bacterial endotoxin is a toxin pro-duced by some bacteria that can kill cells. Studies showthat the amount of endotoxin present correlates with theseverity of periodontal disease. Other bacterial productsinclude proteolytic enzymes, molecules that digest pro-tein found in cells, thereby causing cell destruction. Theimmune response has also been implicated in tissuedestruction. As part of the normal immune response,white blood cells enter regions of inflammation todestroy bacteria. In the process of destroying bacteria,periodontal tissue is also destroyed.\\nGingivitis usually results from inadequate oral\\nhygiene. Proper brushing of the teeth and flossing decreas-es plaque buildup. The bacteria responsible for causinggingivitis reside in the plaque. Plaque is a sticky film thatis largely made from bacteria. Tartar is plaque that hashardened. Plaque can turn into tartar in as little as threedays if not brushed off. Tartar is difficult to remove bybrushing. Gingivitis can be aggravated by hormones, andsometimes becomes temporarily worse during pregnancy ,\\npuberty , and when the patient is taking birth control pills.\\nInterestingly, some drugs used to treat other conditions cancause an overgrowth of the gingival tissue that can result ingingivitis because plaque builds up more easily. Drugsassociated with this condition are phenytoin, used to treatseizures; cyclosporin, given to organ transplant patients toreduce the likelihood of organ rejection; and calciumblockers, used to treat several different heart conditions.\\nScurvy , a vitamin C deficiency and pellagra , a niacin\\ndeficiency, can also lead to bleeding gums and gingivitis.\\nThe initial symptoms of periodontitis are bleeding\\nand inflamed gums, and bad breath . Periodontitis fol-\\nlows cases of gingivitis, which may not be severe enoughto cause a patient to seek dental help. Although thesymptoms of periodontitis are also seen in other forms ofperiodontal diseases, the key characteristic in periodonti-tis is a large pocket that forms between the teeth andgums. Another characteristic of periodontitis is that painusually does not develop until late in the disease, when atooth loosens or an abscess forms.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made by observation of infected gums.\\nUsually, a dentist is the person to diagnose and character-ize the various types of periodontal disease. In cases suchas acute herpetic gingivostomatitis, there are characteris-tic herpetic lesions. Many of the periodontal diseases aredistinguished based on the severity of the infection andthe number and type of tissues involved.\\nDiagnosis of periodontitis includes measuring the\\nsize of the pockets formed between the gums and teeth.Normal gingival pockets are shallow. If periodontal dis-ease is severe, jaw bone loss will be detected in x-rayimages of the teeth. If too much bone is lost, the teethbecome loose and can change position. This will also beseen in x-ray images.\\nTreatment\\nTartar can only be removed by professional dental\\ntreatment. Following treatment, periodontal tissues usual-ly heal quickly. Gingivitis caused by vitamin deficienciesis treated by administering the needed vitamin.

Herpes lesions heal by themselves without treat-ment. After the herpetic lesions have disappeared, thegums usually return to normal if good oral hygiene isresumed. Pericoronitis is treated by removing debrisunder the flap of gum covering the molar. This operationis usually performed by a dentist. Surgery is used toremove molars that are not likely to form properly.\\nTreatment for trench mouth starts with a complete\\ncleaning of the teeth, removal of all plaque, tartar, anddead tissue on the gums. For the first few days aftercleaning, the patient uses hydrogen peroxide mouthwashes instead of brushing. After cleaning, the gum tis-sue will be very raw and rinsing minimizes damage tothe gums that might be caused by the toothbrush. For thefirst few days, the patient should visit the dentist daily forcheckups and then every second or third day for the nexttwo weeks. Occasionally, antibiotic treatment is used tosupplement dental cleaning of the teeth and gums.Surgery may be needed if the damage to the gums isextensive and they do not heal properly.\\nTreatment of periodontitis requires professional den-\\ntal care. The pockets around the teeth must be cleaned, andall tartar and plaque removed. In periodontitis, tartar andplaque can extend far down the tooth root. Normal dentalhygiene, brushing and flossing, cannot reach deep enoughto be effective in treating periodontitis. In cases wherepockets are very deep (more than 0.25 in (0.64 cm) deep),surgery is required to clean the pocket. This is performed\\nin a dental office. Sections of gum that are not likely toreattach to the teeth may be removed to promote healingby healthy sections of gum. Abscesses are treated with acombination of antibiotics and surgery. The antibiotics\\nmay be delivered directly to the infected gum and bone tis-sues to ensure that high concentrations of the antibioticreach the infected area. Abscess infections, especially ofbone, are difficult to treat and require long term antibiotictreatments to prevent a reoccurrence of infection.\\nPrognosis\\nPeriodontal diseases can be easily treated. The gums\\nusually heal and resume their normal shape and function.

Peripheral neuropathy may also be referred toas peripheral neuritis, or if many nerves are involved, theterms polyneuropathy or polyneuritis may be used.\\nDescription\\nPeripheral neuropathy is a widespread disorder, and\\nthere are many underlying causes. Some of these causesare common, such as diabetes, and others are extremelyrare, such as acrylamide poisoning and certain inherited\\ndisorders. The most common worldwide cause of periph-eral neuropathy is leprosy . Leprosy is caused by the bac-\\nterium Mycobacterium leprae , which attacks the periph-\\neral nerves of affected people. According to statisticsgathered by the World Health Organization, an estimated1.15 million people have leprosy worldwide.\\nLeprosy is extremely rare in the United States,\\nwhere diabetes is the most commonly known cause ofKEY TERMS\\nAnaerobic bacteria —Microorganisms that grow in\\nthe absence of oxygen.\\nInflammation —A painful redness and swelling of\\nan area of tissue in response to infection or injury.peripheral neuropathy. It has been estimated that more\\nthan 17 million people in the United States and Europehave diabetes-related polyneuropathy. Many neu-ropathies are idiopathic, meaning that no known causecan be found. The most common of the inherited periph-eral neuropathies in the United States is Charcot-\\nMarie-Tooth disease , which affects approximately\\n125,000 persons.\\nAnother of the better known peripheral neuropathies\\nis Guillain-Barré syndrome , which arises from compli-\\ncations associated with viral illnesses, such as cytomega-lovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and human immunodefi-\\nciency virus (HIV), or bacterial infection, including\\nCampylobacter jejuni and Lyme disease . The worldwide\\nincidence rate is approximately 1.7 cases per 100,000people annually. Other well-known causes of peripheralneuropathies include chronic alcoholism , infection of\\nthe varicella-zoster virus, botulism , and poliomyelitis.\\nPeripheral neuropathy may develop as a primary symp-tom, or it may be due to another disease. For example,peripheral neuropathy is only one symptom of diseasessuch as amyloid neuropathy, certain cancers, or inheritedneurologic disorders. Such diseases may affect theperipheral nervous system (PNS) and the central nervoussystem (CNS), as well as other body tissues.\\nTo understand peripheral neuropathy and its under-\\nlying causes, it may be helpful to review the structuresand arrangement of the PNS.\\nNerve cells and nerves\\nNerve cells are the basic building block of the ner-\\nvous system. In the PNS, nerve cells can be threadlike—their width is microscopic, but their length can be mea-sured in feet. The long, spidery extensions of nerve cellsare called axons. When a nerve cell is stimulated, bytouch or pain , for example, the message is carried along\\nthe axon, and neurotransmitters are released within thecell. Neurotransmitters are chemicals within the nervoussystem that direct nerve cell communication.\\nCertain nerve cell axons, such as the ones in the\\nPNS, are covered with a substance called myelin. Themyelin sheath may be compared to the plastic coating onelectrical wires—it is there both to protect the cells andto prevent interference with the signals being transmit-ted. Protection is also given by Schwann cells, specialcells within the nervous system that wrap around bothmyelinated and unmyelinated axons. The effect is similarto beads threaded on a necklace.\\nNerve cell axons leading to the same areas of the\\nbody may be bundled together into nerves. Continuingthe comparison to electrical wires, nerves may be com-pared to an electrical cord—the individual components\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2549Peripheral neuropathy'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 256}, page_content='are coated in their own sheaths and then encased together\\ninside a larger protective covering.\\nPeripheral nervous system\\nThe nervous system is classified into two parts: the\\nCNS and the PNS. The CNS is made up of the brain andthe spinal cord, and the PNS is composed of the nervesthat lead to or branch off from the CNS.\\nThe peripheral nerves handle a diverse array of func-\\ntions in the body. This diversity is reflected in the majordivisions of the PNS—the afferent and the efferent divi-sions. The afferent division is in charge of sending senso-ry information from the body to the CNS. When afferentnerve cell endings, called receptors, are stimulated, theyrelease neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters relaya signal to the brain, which interprets it and reacts byreleasing other neurotransmitters.\\nSome of the neurotransmitters released by the brain\\nare directed at the efferent division of the PNS. Theefferent nerves control voluntary movements, such asmoving the arms and legs, and involuntary movements,such as making the heart pump blood. The nerves con-trolling voluntary movements are called motor nerves,and the nerves controlling involuntary actions arereferred to as autonomic nerves. The afferent and effer-ent divisions continually interact with each other. Forexample, if a person were to touch a hot stove, thereceptors in the skin would transmit a message of heatand pain through the sensory nerves to the brain. Themessage would be processed in the brain and a reaction,such as pulling back the hand, would be transmitted viaa motor nerve.\\nNeuropathy\\nNERVE DAMAGE. When an individual has a peripher-\\nal neuropathy, nerves of the PNS have been damaged.Nerve damage can arise from a number of causes, suchas disease, physical injury, poisoning, or malnutrition .\\nThese agents may affect either afferent or efferentnerves. Depending on the cause of damage, the nerve cellaxon, its protective myelin sheath, or both may beinjured or destroyed.\\nCLASSIFICATION. There are hundreds of peripheral\\nneuropathies. Reflecting the scope of PNS activity,symptoms may involve sensory, motor, or autonomicfunctions. To aid in diagnosis and treatment, the symp-toms are classified into principal neuropathic syndromesbased on the type of affected nerves and how long symp-toms have been developing. Acute development refers tosymptoms that have appeared within days, and subacuterefers to those that have evolved over a number of weeks.Early chronic symptoms are those that take months to a\\nfew years to develop, and late chronic symptoms havebeen present for several years.\\nThe classification system is composed of six princi-\\npal neuropathic syndromes, which are subdivided intomore specific categories. By narrowing down the possi-ble diagnoses in this way, specific medical tests can beused more efficiently and effectively. The six syndromesand a few associated causes are listed below:\\n• Acute motor paralysis , accompanied by variable prob-\\nlems with sensory and autonomic functions. Neu-ropathies associated with this syndrome are mainlyaccompanied by motor nerve problems, but the sensoryand autonomic nerves may also be involved. Associateddisorders include Guillain-Barré syndrome, diphtheriticpolyneuropathy, and porphyritic neuropathy.\\n• Subacute sensorimotor paralysis. The term sensorimo-\\ntor refers to neuropathies that are mainly characterizedby sensory symptoms, but also have a minor compo-nent of motor nerve problems. Poisoning with heavymetals (e.g., lead, mercury, and arsenic), chemicals, ordrugs are linked to this syndrome. Diabetes, Lyme dis-ease, and malnutrition are also possible causes.\\n• Chronic sensorimotor paralysis. Physical symptoms\\nmay resemble those in the above syndrome, but thetime scale of symptom development is extended. Thissyndrome encompasses neuropathies arising from can-cers, diabetes, leprosy, inherited neurologic and meta-bolic disorders, and hypothyroidism .\\n• Neuropathy associated with mitochondrial diseases.\\nMitochondria are organelles—structures within cells—responsible for handling a cell’s energy requirements. Ifthe mitochondria are damaged or destroyed, the cell’senergy requirements are not met and it can die.\\n• Recurrent or relapsing polyneuropathy. This syndrome\\ncovers neuropathies that affect several nerves and maycome and go, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, por-phyria, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating poly-neuropathy.\\n• Mononeuropathy or plexopathy. Nerve damage associ-\\nated with this syndrome is limited to a single nerve or afew closely associated nerves. Neuropathies related tophysical injury to the nerve, such as carpal tunnel syn-\\ndrome and sciatica , are included in this syndrome.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nTypical symptoms of neuropathy are related to the\\ntype of affected nerve. If a sensory nerve is damaged, com-mon symptoms include numbness, tingling in the area, aprickling sensation, or pain.

In some cases, a nonpainfulstimulus may be perceived as excruciating or pain may befelt even in the absence of a stimulus. Damage to a motornerve is usually indicated by weakness in the affected area.If the problem with the motor nerve has continued over alength of time, muscle shrinkage (atrophy) or lack of mus-cle tone may be noticeable. Autonomic nerve damage ismost noticeable when an individual stands upright andexperiences problems such as light-headedness or changesin blood pressure. Other indicators of autonomic nervedamage are lack of sweat, tears, and saliva; constipation ;\\nurinary retention; and impotence . In some cases, heart beat\\nirregularities and respiratory problems can develop.\\nSymptoms may appear over days, weeks, months, or\\nyears. Their duration and the ultimate outcome of theneuropathy are linked to the cause of the nerve damage.Potential causes include diseases, physical injuries, poi-soning, and malnutrition or alcohol abuse. In some cases,neuropathy is not the primary disorder, but a symptom ofan underlying disease.KEY TERMS\\nAfferent —Refers to peripheral nerves that transmit\\nsignals to the spinal cord and the brain.

The diabetes-peripheralneuropathy link has been well established. A typical pat-tern of diabetes-associated neuropathic symptomsincludes sensory effects that first begin in the feet. Theassociated pain or pins-and-needles, burning, crawling,or prickling sensations form a typical “stocking” distrib-ution in the feet and lower legs. Other diabetic neu-ropathies affect the autonomic nerves and have potential-ly fatal cardiovascular complications.\\nSeveral other metabolic diseases have a strong asso-\\nciation with peripheral neuropathy. Uremia, or chronic\\nkidney failure , carries a 10–90% risk of eventually\\ndeveloping neuropathy, and there may be an associationbetween liver failure and peripheral neuropathy.

Leprosy is caused by thebacteria M. leprae , which directly attack sensory nerves.\\nOther bacterial illness may set the stage for an immune-mediated attack on the nerves. For example, one theoryabout Guillain-Barré syndrome involves complicationsfollowing infection with Campylobacter jejuni , a bac-\\nterium commonly associated with food poisoning . This\\nbacterium carries a protein that closely resembles com-ponents of myelin. The immune system launches anattack against the bacteria; but, according to the theory,the immune system confuses the myelin with the bacte-ria in some cases and attacks the myelin sheath as well.The underlying cause of neuropathy associated withLyme disease is unknown; the bacteria may either pro-mote an immune-mediated attack on the nerve or inflictdamage directly.\\nInfection with certain viruses is associated with\\nextremely painful sensory neuropathies. A primaryexample of such a neuropathy is caused by shingles .\\nAfter a case of chickenpox , the causative virus, varicel-\\nla-zoster virus, becomes inactive in sensory nerves. Yearslater, the virus may be reactivated. Once reactivated, itattacks and destroys axons. Infection with HIV is alsoassociated with peripheral neuropathy, but the type ofneuropathy that develops can vary. Some HIV-linkedneuropathies are noted for myelin destruction rather thanaxonal degradation. Also, HIV infection is frequentlyaccompanied by other infections, both bacterial andviral, that are associated with neuropathy.\\nSeveral types of peripheral neuropathies are associ-\\nated with inherited disorders. These inherited disordersmay primarily involve the nervous system, or the effectson the nervous system may be secondary to an inheritedmetabolic disorder. Inherited neuropathies can fall intoseveral of the principal syndromes, because symptomsmay be sensory, motor, or autonomic. The inheritancepatterns also vary, depending on the specific disorder.The development of inherited disorders is typicallydrawn out over several years and may herald a degenera-tive condition—that is, a condition that becomes progres-sively worse over time. Even among specific disorders,there may be a degree of variability in inheritance pat-terns and symptoms. For example, Charcot-Marie-Tooth\\ndisease is usually inherited as an autosomal dominantdisorder, but it can be autosomal recessive or, in rarecases, linked to the X chromosome. Its estimated fre-quency is approximately one in 2,500 people. Age ofonset and sensory nerve involvement can vary betweencases. The main symptom is a degeneration of the motornerves in legs and arms, and resultant muscle atrophy.Other inherited neuropathies have a distinctly metaboliccomponent. For example, in familial amyloid polyneu-ropathies, protein components that make up the myelinare constructed and deposited incorrectly.\\nPhysical injury\\nAccidental falls and mishaps during sports and recre-\\national activities are common causes of physical injuriesthat can result in peripheral neuropathy. The commontypes of injuries in these situations occur from placing toomuch pressure on the nerve, exceeding the nerve’s capaci-ty to stretch, blocking adequate blood supply of oxygenand nutrients to the nerve, and tearing the nerve. Pain maynot always be immediately noticeable, and obvious signsof damage may take a while to develop.\\nThese injuries usually affect one nerve or a group of\\nclosely associated nerves. For example, a common injuryencountered in contact sports such as football is the“burner,” or “stinger,” syndrome. Typically, a stinger iscaused by overstretching the main nerves that span fromthe neck into the arm. Immediate symptoms are numb-ness, tingling, and pain that travels down the arm, lastingonly a minute or two. A single incident of a stinger is notdangerous, but recurrences can eventually cause perma-nent motor and sensory loss.\\nPoisoning\\nThe poisons, or toxins, that cause peripheral neu-\\nropathy include drugs, industrial chemicals, and environ-mental toxins. Neuropathy that is caused by drugs usual-ly involves sensory nerves on both sides of the body, par-ticularly in the hands and feet, and pain is a commonsymptom. Neuropathy is an unusual side effect of med-ications; therefore, most people can use these drugs safe-ly. A few of the drugs that have been linked with periph-eral neuropathy include metronidazole, an antibiotic;phenytoin, an anticonvulsant; and simvastatin, a choles-terol-lowering medication.\\nCertain industrial chemicals have been shown to be\\npoisonous to nerves (neurotoxic) following work-relatedexposures. Chemicals such as acrylamide, allyl chloride,and carbon disulfide have all been strongly linked todevelopment of peripheral neuropathy.

Either route of exposure can producesevere sensorimotor neuropathy that develops rapidly.\\nHeavy metals are the third group of toxins that cause\\nperipheral neuropathy. Lead, arsenic, thallium, and mer-cury usually are not toxic in their elemental form, butrather as components in organic or inorganic compounds.The types of metal-induced neuropathies vary widely.Arsenic poisoning may mimic Guillain-Barré syndrome;lead affects motor nerves more than sensory nerves; thal-lium produces painful sensorimotor neuropathy; and theeffects of mercury are seen in both the CNS and PNS.\\nMalnutrition and alcohol abuse\\nBurning, stabbing pains and numbness in the feet,\\nand sometimes in the hands, are distinguishing featuresof alcoholic neuropathy. The level of alcohol consump-tion associated with this variety of peripheral neuropathyhas been estimated as approximately 3 L of beer or 300mL of liquor daily for three years. However, it is unclearwhether alcohol alone is responsible for the neuropathicsymptoms, because chronic alcoholism is strongly asso-ciated with malnutrition.\\nMalnutrition refers to an extreme lack of nutrients\\nin the diet. It is unknown precisely which nutrient defi-ciencies cause peripheral neuropathies in alcoholics andfamine and starvation patients, but it is suspected that\\nthe B vitamins have a significant role. For example, thi-\\namine (vitamin B\\n1) deficiency is the cause of beriberi ,a\\nneuropathic disease characterized by heart failure and\\npainful polyneuropathy of sensory nerves. Vitamin E\\ndeficiency seems to have a role in both CNS and PNS\\nneuropathy.\\nDiagnosis\\nClinical symptoms can indicate peripheral neuropa-\\nthy, but an exact diagnosis requires a combination ofmedical history, medical tests, and possibly a process ofexclusion. Certain symptoms can suggest a diagnosis,but more information is commonly needed. For example,painful, burning feet may be a symptom of alcoholabuse, diabetes, HIV infection, or an underlying malig-nant tumor, among other causes. Without further details,effective treatment would be difficult.\\nDuring a physical examination , an individual is\\nasked to describe the symptoms very carefully. Detailedinformation about the location, nature, and duration ofsymptoms can help exclude some causes or even pin-point the actual problem. The person’s medical historymay also provide clues as to the cause, because certaindiseases and medications are linked to specific peripheralneuropathies. A medical history should also include\\ninformation about diseases that run in the family, becausesome peripheral neuropathies are genetically linked.Information about hobbies, recreational activities, alco-hol consumption, and work place activities can uncoverpossible injuries or exposures to poisonous substances.\\nThe physical examination also includes blood tests,\\nsuch as those that check levels of glucose and creatinineto detect diabetes and kidney problems, respectively. Ablood count is also done to determine levels of different\\nblood cell types. Iron, vitamin B\\n12, and other factors may\\nbe measured as well, to rule out malnutrition. More spe-cific tests, such as an assay for heavy metals or poisonoussubstances, or tests to detect vasculitis , are not typically\\ndone unless there is reason to suspect a particular cause.\\nAn individual with neuropathy may be sent to a doc-\\ntor that specializes in nervous system disorders (neurolo-gist). By considering the results of the physical examina-tion and observations of the referring doctor, the neurolo-gist may be able to narrow down the possible diagnoses.Additional tests, such as nerve conduction studies andelectromyography , which tests muscle reactions, can\\nconfirm that nerve damage has occurred and may also beable to indicate the nature of the damage. For example,some neuropathies are characterized by destruction ofthe myelin. This type of damage is shown by slowednerve conduction. If the axon itself has suffered damage,the nerve conduction may be slowed, but it will also bediminished in strength. Electromyography adds furtherinformation by measuring nerve conduction and muscleresponse, which determines whether the symptoms aredue to a neuropathy or to a muscle disorder.\\nIn approximately 10% of peripheral neuropathy\\ncases, a nerve biopsy may be helpful. In this test, a smallpart of the nerve is surgically removed and examinedunder a microscope. This procedure is usually the mosthelpful in confirming a suspected diagnosis, rather thanas a diagnostic procedure by itself.\\nTreatment\\nTreat the cause\\nAttacking the underlying cause of the neuropathy can\\nprevent further nerve damage and may allow for a betterrecovery. For example, in cases of bacterial infection suchas leprosy or Lyme disease, antibiotics may be given to\\ndestroy the infectious bacteria. Viral infections are moredifficult to treat, because antibiotics are not effectiveagainst them. Neuropathies associated with drugs, chemi-cals, and toxins are treated in part by stopping exposure tothe damaging agent. Chemicals such as ethylenediaminete-traacetic acid (EDTA) are used to help the body concen-trate and excrete some toxins. Diabetic neuropathies may\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2553Peripheral neuropathy'),\n",

In somecases, such as compression injury or tumors, surgery maybe considered to relieve pressure on a nerve.\\nIn a crisis situation, as in the onset of Guillain-Barré\\nsyndrome, plasma exchange, intravenous immunoglobu-lin, and steroids may be given. Intubation, in which atube is inserted into the trachea to maintain an open air-way, and ventilation may be required to support the res-piratory system. Treatment may focus more on symptommanagement than on combating the underlying cause, atleast until a definitive diagnosis has been made.\\nSupportive care and long-term therapy\\nSome peripheral neuropathies cannot be resolved or\\nrequire time for resolution. In these cases, long-term mon-itoring and supportive care is necessary. Medical tests maybe repeated to chart the progress of the neuropathy. Ifautonomic nerve involvement is a concern, regular moni-toring of the cardiovascular system may be carried out.\\nBecause pain is associated with many of the neu-\\nropathies, a pain management plan may need to be\\nmapped out, especially if the pain becomes chronic. Asin any chronic disease, narcotics are best avoided. Agentsthat may be helpful in neuropathic pain includeamitriptyline, carbamazepine, and capsaicin cream.Physical therapy and physician-directed exercises canhelp maintain or improve function. In cases in whichmotor nerves are affected, braces and other supportiveequipment can aid an individual’s ability to move about.\\nPrognosis\\nThe outcome for peripheral neuropathy depends\\nheavily on the cause. Peripheral neuropathy ranges froma reversible problem to a potentially fatal complication.In the best cases, a damaged nerve regenerates. Nervecells cannot be replaced if they are killed, but they arecapable of recovering from damage. The extent of recov-ery is tied to the extent of the damage and a person’s ageand general health status. Recovery can take weeks toyears, because neurons grow very slowly. Full recoverymay not be possible and it may also not be possible todetermine the prognosis at the outset.\\nIf the neuropathy is a degenerative condition, such\\nas Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, an individual’s condi-tion will become worse. There may be periods of timewhen the disease seems to reach a plateau, but cures havenot yet been discovered for many of these degenerativediseases. Therefore, continued symptoms, potentiallyworsening to disabilities are to be expected.A few peripheral neuropathies are eventually fatal.\\nFatalities have been associated with some cases of diph-\\ntheria , botulism, and others. Some diseases associated\\nwith neuropathy may also be fatal, but the ultimate causeof death is not necessarily related to the neuropathy,\\nsuch as with cancer .\\nPrevention\\nPeripheral neuropathies are preventable only to the\\nextent that the underlying causes are preventable. Stepsthat a person can take to prevent potential problemsinclude vaccines against diseases that cause neuropathy,such as polio and diphtheria. Treatment for physical\\ninjuries in a timely manner can help prevent permanentor worsening damage to nerves. Precautions when usingcertain chemicals and drugs are well advised in order toprevent exposure to neurotoxic agents. Control of chron-ic diseases such as diabetes may also reduce the chancesof developing peripheral neuropathy.\\nAlthough not a preventive measure, genetic screen-\\ning can serve as an early warning for potential problems.Genetic screening is available for some inherited condi-tions, but not all. In some cases, presence of a particulargene may not mean that a person will necessarily devel-op the disease, because there may be environmental andother components involved.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAdams, Raymond D., Maurice Victor, and Allan H.

It mostly occurs in thelegs, but is sometimes seen in the arms.\\nDescription\\nPeripheral vascular disease includes a group of dis-\\neases in which blood vessels become restricted orblocked. Typically, the patient has peripheral vasculardisease from atherosclerosis . Atherosclerosis is a dis-\\nease in which fatty plaques form in the inside walls ofblood vessels. Other processes, such as blood clots, fur-ther restrict blood flow in the blood vessels. Both veinsand arteries may be affected, but the disease is usuallyarterial. All the symptoms and consequences of peripher-al vascular disease are related to restricted blood flow.Peripheral vascular disease is a progressive disease thatcan lead to gangrene of the affected area. Peripheral vas-\\ncular disease may also occur suddenly if an embolism\\noccurs or when a blot clot rapidly develops in a bloodvessel already restricted by an atherosclerotic plaque,and the blood flow is quickly cut off.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are many causes of peripheral vascular dis-\\nease. One major risk factor is smoking cigarettes. Other\\ndiseases predispose patients to develop peripheral vascu-lar disease. These include diabetes, Buerger’s disease ,\\nhypertension , and Raynaud’s disease . The main symp-\\ntom is pain in the affected area. Early symptoms include\\nan achy, tired sensation in the affected muscles. Sincethis disease is seen mainly in the legs, these sensationsusually occur when walking. The symptoms may disap-pear when resting. As the disease becomes worse, symp-toms occur even during light exertion and, eventually,occur all the time, even at rest. In the severe stages of theKEY TERMS\\nEmbolism —The blockage of a blood vessel by air,\\nblood clot, or other foreign body.\\nPlaque —A deposit, usually of fatty material, on\\nthe inside wall of a blood vessel.\\ndisease the leg and foot may be cold to the touch and will\\nfeel numb. The skin may become dry and scaly. If the legis even slightly injured, ulcers may form because, with-out a good blood supply, proper healing can not takeplace. At the most severe stage of the disease, when theblood flow is greatly restricted, gangrene can develop inthose areas lacking blood supply. In some cases, periph-eral vascular disease occurs suddenly. This happenswhen an embolism rapidly blocks blood flow to a bloodvessel. The patient will experience a sharp pain. followedby a loss of sensation in the affected area. The limb willbecome cold and numb, and loose color or turn bluish.\\nDiagnosis\\nPeripheral vascular disease can be diagnosed by\\ncomparing blood pressures taken above and below thepoint of pain. The area below the pain (downstream fromthe obstruction) will have a much lower or undetectableblood pressure reading. Doppler ultrasonography and\\nangiography can also be used to diagnose and define\\nthis disease.\\nTreatment\\nIf the person is a smoker, they should stop smoking\\nimmediately. Exercise is essential to treating this disease.\\nThe patient should walk until pain appears, rest until thepain disappears, and then resume walking. The amount ofwalking a patient can do should increase gradually as thesymptoms improve. Ideally, the patient should walk 30–60minutes per day. Infections in the affected area should betreated promptly. Surgery may be required to attempt totreat clogged blood vessels. Limbs with gangrene must beamputated to prevent the death of the patient.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis depends on the underlying disease and\\nthe stage at which peripheral vascular disease is discov-ered. Removal of risk factors, such as smoking, should bedone immediately. In many cases, peripheral vascular dis-ease can be treated successfully but coexisting cardiovas-cular problems may ultimately prove to be fatal.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2555Peripheral vascular disease'),\n",

This membrane is called the peritoneum.\\nDescription\\nPeritonitis may be primary (meaning that it occurs\\nspontaneously, and not as the result of some other med-ical problem) or secondary (meaning that it results fromsome other condition). It is most often due to infectionby bacteria, but may also be due to some kind of achemical irritant (such as spillage of acid from the stom-ach, bile from the gall bladder and biliary tract, orenzymes from the pancreas during the illness calledpancreatitis ). Peritonitis has even been seen in patients\\nwho develop a reaction to the cornstarch used to powdergloves worn during surgery. Peritonitis with no evidenceof bacteria, chemical irritant, or foreign body hasoccurred in such diseases as systemic lupus erythe-\\nmatosus , porphyria, and familial Mediterranean\\nfever . When the peritoneum is contaminated by blood,\\nthe blood can both irritate the peritoneum and serve as asource of bacteria to cause an infection. Blood may leakinto the abdomen due to a burst tubal pregnancy ,a n\\ninjury, or bleeding after surgery.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPrimary peritonitis usually occurs in people who\\nhave an accumulation of fluid in their abdomens ( ascites ).\\nAscites is a common complication of severe cirrhosis of\\nthe liver (a disease in which the liver grows increasinglyscarred and dysfunctional). The fluid that accumulatescreates a good environment for the growth of bacteria.Secondary peritonitis most commonly occurs when\\nsome other medical condition causes bacteria to spill intothe abdominal cavity. Bacteria are normal residents of ahealthy intestine, but they should have no way to escapeand enter the abdomen, where they could cause an infec-tion. Bacteria can infect the peritoneum due to conditionsin which a hole (perforation) develops in the stomach(due to an ulcer eating its way through the stomach wall)or intestine (due to a large number of causes, including aruptured appendix or a ruptured diverticulum). Bacteriacan infect the peritoneum due to a severe case of pelvic\\ninflammatory disease (a massive infection of the female\\norgans, including the uterus and fallopian tubes). Bacte-ria can also escape into the abdominal cavity due to aninjury that causes the intestine to burst, or an injury to aninternal organ which bleeds into the abdominal cavity.\\nSymptoms of peritonitis include fever and abdominal\\npain . An acutely ill patient usually tries to lie very still,\\nbecause any amount of movement causes excruciatingpain. Often, the patient lies with the knees bent, todecrease strain on the tender peritoneum. There is oftennausea and vomiting . The usual sounds made by the\\nactive intestine and heard during examination with astethoscope will be absent, because the intestine usuallystops functioning. The abdomen may be rigid and board-like. Accumulations of fluid will be notable in primaryperitonitis due to ascites. Other signs and symptoms of theunderlying cause of secondary peritonitis may be present.\\nDiagnosis\\nA diagnosis of peritonitis is usually based on symp-\\ntoms. Discovering the underlying reason for the peritoni-tis, however, may require some work. A blood samplewill be drawn in order to determine the white blood cellcount. Because white blood cells are produced by thebody in an effort to combat foreign invaders, the whiteblood cell count will be elevated in the case of an infec-tion. A long, thin needle can be used to take a sample offluid from the abdomen in an effort to diagnose primaryperitonitis. The types of immune cells present are usuallycharacteristic in this form of peritonitis. X-ray films maybe taken if there is some suspicion that a perforationexists. In the case of a perforation, air will have escapedinto the abdomen and will be visible on the picture. Whena cause for peritonitis cannot be found, an open explorato-ry operation on the abdomen (laparotomy) is consideredto be a crucial diagnostic procedure, and at the same timeprovides the opportunity to begin treatment.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment depends on the source of the peritonitis,\\nbut an emergency laparotomy is usually performed.

True pernicious anemia refers specifically to\\na disorder of atrophied parietal cells leading to absentintrinsic factor, resulting in an inability to absorb B\\n12.\\nDescription\\nVitamin B12, or cobalamin, plays an important role in\\nthe development of red blood cells. It is found in signifi-cant quantities in liver, meats, milk and milk products,and legumes. During the course of the digestion of foodscontaining B\\n12, the B12becomes attached to a substance\\ncalled intrinsic factor. Intrinsic factor is produced byparietal cells which line the stomach. The B\\n12-intrinsic\\nfactor complex then enters the intestine, where the vita-min is absorbed into the bloodstream. In fact, B\\n12can\\nonly be absorbed when it is attached to intrinsic factor.\\nIn pernicious anemia, the parietal cells stop produc-\\ning intrinsic factor. The intestine is then completelyunable to absorb B\\n12. So, the vitamin passes out of the\\nbody as waste. Although the body has significant amountsof stored B\\n12, this will eventually be used up. At this point,\\nthe symptoms of pernicious anemia will develop.\\nPernicious anemia is most common among people\\nfrom northern Europe and among African Americans. Itis far less frequently seen among people from southernEurope and Asia. Pernicious anemia occurs in equalnumbers in both men and women. Most patients withpernicious anemia are older, usually over 60. Occasion-ally, a child will have an inherited condition whichresults in defective intrinsic factor. Pernicious anemiaseems to run in families, so that anyone with a relativediagnosed with the disease has a greater likelihood ofdeveloping it as well.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2557Pernicious anemia'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 264}, page_content='Causes and symptoms\\nIntrinsic factor is produced by specialized cells with-\\nin the stomach called parietal cells. When these parietalcells shrink in size (atrophy), they produce less and lessintrinsic factor. Eventually, the parietal cells stop func-tioning altogether. Other important products of parietalcells are also lessened, including stomach acid, and anenzyme involved in the digestion of proteins.\\nPeople with pernicious anemia seem to have a\\ngreater chance of having certain other conditions. Theseconditions include autoimmune disorders , particularly\\nthose affecting the thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenals. Itis thought that the immune system, already out of controlin these diseases, incorrectly becomes directed againstthe parietal cells. Ultimately, the parietal cells seem to bedestroyed by the actions of the immune system.\\nAs noted, true pernicious anemia refers specifical-\\nly to a disorder of atrophied parietal cells leading toabsent intrinsic factor, resulting in an inability toabsorb B\\n12. However, there are other related conditions\\nwhich result in decreased absorption of B 12. These con-\\nditions cause the same types of symptoms as true per-nicious anemia. Other conditions that interfere witheither the production of intrinsic factor, or the body’suse of B\\n12, include conditions that require surgical\\nremoval of the stomach, or poisonings with corrosivesubstances which destroy the lining of the stomach.Certain structural defects of the intestinal system canresult in an overgrowth of normal bacteria. These bac-teria then absorb B\\n12themselves, for use in their own\\ngrowth. Intestinal worms (especially one called fishtapeworm) may also use B\\n12, resulting in anemia. Vari-\\nous conditions that affect the first part of the intestine(the ileum), from which B\\n12is absorbed, can also cause\\nanemia due to B12deficiency. These ilium related disor-ders include tropical sprue, Whipple’s disease,\\nCrohn’s disease ,tuberculosis , and the Zollinger-Elli-\\nson syndrome.\\nSymptoms of pernicious anemia and decreased B 12\\naffect three systems of the body: the system that is involved\\nin the formation of blood cells (hematopoietic system); thegastrointestinal system; and the nervous system.\\nThe hematopoietic system is harmed because B\\n12is\\nrequired for the proper formation of red blood cells.Without B\\n12, red blood cell production is greatly reduced.\\nThose red blood cells that are produced are abnormallylarge and abnormal in shape. Because red blood cells areresponsible for carrying oxygen around the body,decreased numbers (termed anemia) result in a numberof symptoms, including fatigue ,dizziness , ringing in the\\nears, pale or yellowish skin, fast heart rate, enlarged heartwith an abnormal heart sound (murmur) evident onexamination, and chest pain .\\nSymptoms that affect the gastrointestinal system\\ninclude a sore and brightly red tongue, loss of appetite,weight loss, diarrhea , and abdominal cramping.\\nThe nervous system is severely affected when perni-\\ncious anemia goes untreated. Symptoms include numb-ness, tingling, or burning in the arms, legs, hands, andfeet; muscle weakness; difficulty and loss of balancewhile walking; changes in reflexes; irritability, confu-sion, and depression.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of pernicious anemia is suggested when a\\nblood test reveals abnormally large red blood cells. Manyof these will also be abnormally shaped. The earliest,least mature forms of red blood cells (reticulocytes) willalso be low in number. White blood cells and plateletsmay also be decreased in number. Measurements of thequantity of B\\n12circulating in the bloodstream will be low.\\nOnce these determinations are made, it will be\\nimportant to diagnose the cause of the anemia. True per-nicious anemia means that the parietal cells of the stom-ach are atrophied, resulting in decreased production ofintrinsic factor. This diagnosis is made by the Schillingtest. In this test, a patient is given radioactive B\\n12under\\ntwo different sets of conditions: once alone, and onceattached to intrinsic factor. Normally, large amounts ofB\\n12are absorbed through the intestine, then circulate\\nthrough the blood, and enter the kidneys, where a certainamount of B\\n12is then passed out in the urine. When a\\npatient has pernicious anemia, the dose of B12given by\\nitself will not be absorbed by the intestine, so it will notpass into the urine. Therefore, levels of B\\n12in the urine\\nwill be low. When the B12is given along with intrinsic\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2558Pernicious anemia\\nA smear of red blood cells indicating folic acid (vitamin B12)\\ndeficiency.

Vitamin B12given\\nby injection enters the bloodstream directly, and does notrequire intrinsic factor. At first, injections may need to begiven several times a week, in order to build up adequatestores of the vitamin. After this, the injections can begiven on a monthly basis. Other substances required forblood cell production may also need to be given, such asiron and vitamin C.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis is generally good for patients with perni-\\ncious anemia.

Peroxisomes areorganelles within a cell that contain enzymes responsiblefor critical cellular processes, including oxidation offatty acids, biosynthesis of membrane phospholipids(plasmalogens), cholesterol, and bile acids, conversion ofamino acids into glucose, reduction of hydrogen perox-ide by catalase, and prevention of excess synthesis ofoxalate (which can form crystals with calcium, resultingin kidney stones ). Peroxisomal disorders are subdivided\\ninto two major categories: those disorders resulting froma failure to form intact, normal peroxisomes, resulting inmultiple metabolical abnormalities, which are referred toas peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBD) or as general-ized peroxisomal disorders; and those disorders resultingfrom the deficiency of a single peroxisomal enzyme.There are about 25 peroxisomal disorders known,although the number of diseases that are considered to be\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2559Peroxisomal disorders'),\n",

By definition, a peroxi-some must contain catalase, which is an enzyme thatbreaks down hydrogen peroxide.\\nApproximately fifty different biochemical reactions\\noccur entirely or partially within a peroxisome. Some ofthe processes are anabolic, or constructive, resulting inthe synthesis of essential biochemical compounds,including bile acids, cholesterol, plasmalogens, anddocosahexanoic acid (DHA), which is a long chain fattyacid that is a component of complex lipids, including themembranes of the central nervous system. Other reac-tions are catabolic, or destructive, and lead to thedestruction of some fatty acids, including very long chainfatty acids (VLCFAs, fatty acids with more than 22 car-bon atoms in their chains), phytanic acid, pipecolic acid,and the prostoglandins.The peroxisome is involved inbreaking down VLCFAs to lengths that the body can useor get rid of.\\nWhen VLCFAs accumulate due to abnormal func-\\ntioning of the peroxisomes, they are disruptive to thestructure and stability of certain cells, especially thoseassociated with the central nervous system and the myelinsheath, which is the fatty covering of nerve fibers. Theperoxisomal disorders that include effects on the growthof the myelin sheath are considered to be part of a groupof genetic disorders referred to as leukodystrophies.\\nThere are many other metabolic deficiencies that\\ncan occur in those who have peroxisomal disorders,which result in other types of detrimental effects, andtogether result in the abnormalities associated with theperoxisomal disorders. Unfortunately, it is not knownhow these abnormalities, and combinations of abnor-malities, cause the disabilities seen in those afflictedwith the disease.\\nPeroxisomal disorders form a heterogeneous disease\\ngroup, with different degrees of severity. Included in thegroup referred to as PBD are:\\n• Zellweger syndrome (ZS), which is usually fatal within\\nthe first year of life,\\n• neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), which is\\nusually fatal within the first ten years,\\n• infantile Refsum disease (IRD), which is not as devas-\\ntating as ZS and NALD, as the children with this disor-der with time and patience can develop some degree of\\nmotor, cognitive, and communication skills, althoughdeath generally occurs during the second decade of\\nlife,\\n• rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP), which\\nin its most severe form is fatal within the first year ortwo of life; however, survival into the teens has beenknown to occur. It is characterized by shortening of theproximal limbs (i.e., the legs from knee to foot, and thearms from elbow to hand) and,\\n• Zellweger-like syndrome, which is fatal in infancy, and\\nis known to be a defect of three particular enzymes.\\nThe differences among these disorders are continu-\\nous, with overlap between abnormalities. The range ofdisease abnormalities may be a result of a correspondingrange of peroxisome failure; that is, in severe cases ofZS, the failure is nearly complete, while in IRD, there issome degree of peroxisome activity.\\nIn peroxisomal single-enzyme disorders, the peroxi-\\nsome is intact and functioning, but there is a defect inonly one enzymatic process, with only one correspond-ing biochemical abnormality. However, these disorderscan be as severe as those in which peroxisomal activity isnearly or completely absent.\\nX-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is the\\nmost common of the peroxisomal disorders, affectingabout one in 20,000 males. It is estimated that there areabout 1,400 people in the United States with the disor-der. In X-ALD there is a deficiency in the enzyme thatbreaks down VLCFAs, which then accumulate in themyelin and adrenal glands. Onset of X-ALD-relatedneurological symptoms occurs at about 5–12 years ofage, with death occurring within one to 10 years afteronset of symptoms. In addition to physical abnormali-ties seen in other types of peroxisomal disorders, com-mon symptoms of X-ALD also include behavioralchanges such as abnormal withdrawal or aggression,poor memory, dementia , and poor academic perfor-\\nmance. Other symptoms are muscle weakness and diffi-culties with hearing, speech, and vision. As the diseaseprogresses, muscle tone deteriorates, swallowingbecomes difficult and the patient becomes comatose.Unless treated with a diet that include’s Lorenzo’s oil,the disease will result in paralysis ,hearing loss , blind-\\nness, vegetative state , and death. There are also milder\\nforms of X-ALD: an adult on-set ALD that typicallybegins between the ages of 21 and 35, and a form that isoccasionally seen in women who are carriers of the dis-order. In addition to X-ALD, there are at least ten othersingle-enzyme peroxisomal disorders, each with its ownspecific abnormalities.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2560Peroxisomal disorders'),\n",

Theyoccur in all countries, among all races and ethnic groups.They are extremely rare, with frequencies reported at onein 30,000 to one in 150,000, although these numbers areonly estimates.\\nIn general, developmental delay, mental retarda-\\ntion, and vision and hearing impairment are common in\\nthose who have these disorders. Acquisition of speechappears to be especially difficult, and because of thereduced communication abilities, autism is common in\\nthose who live longer. Peroxisomal disorder patientshave decreased muscle tone (hypotonia), which in themost severe cases is generalized, while in less severecases, is usually restricted to the neck and trunk muscles.Sometimes this lack of control is only noticeable by acurved back in the sitting position. Head control andindependent sitting is delayed, with most patients unableto walk independently.\\nFailure to thrive is a common characteristic of\\npatients with peroxisomal disorder, along with anenlarged liver, abnormalities in liver enzyme function,and loss of fats in stools (steatorrhea).\\nPeroxisomal disorders are also associated with facial\\nabnormalities, including high forehead, frontal bossing(swelling), small face, low set ears, and slanted eyes.These characteristics may not be prominent in some chil-dren, and are especially difficult to identify in an infant.\\nDiagnosis\\nSince hearing and vision deficiencies may be difficult\\nto identify in infants, peroxisomal disorders are usuallydetected by observations of failure to thrive, hypotonia,mental retardation, widely open fontanel, abnormalities inliver enzymes, and an enlarged liver. If peroxisomal disor-ders are suspected, blood plasma assays for VLCFAs, phy-tanic acid, and pipecolic acid are conducted. Additional testsinclude plasmalogen biosynthesis potential.\\nTreatment\\nFor many of the peroxisomal disorders, there is no\\nstandard course of treatment, with supportive treatmentstrategies focusing on alleviation of complications andsymptoms. In general, most treatments that are attemptedare dietary, whereby attempts are made to artificially cor-rect biochemical abnormalities associated with the disor-ders. Therapies include supplementation of the diet withantioxidant vitamins , or limitation of intake of fatty\\nacids, especially VLCFAs.Another area of dietary therapy that is being investigat-\\ned is the supplementation of the diet with pure DHA, givenas early in life as possible, in conjunction with a normalwell-balanced diet. Some results have indicated that if givensoon enough during development, DHA therapy may pre-vent some of the devastating consequences of peroxisomaldisorders, including the loss of vision and brain damage.\\nOther treatment strategies include addition of impor-\\ntant missing chemicals. For example, in disorders wherethere is faulty adrenal function, replacement adrenal hor-mone therapy is used.\\nAny dietary changes should be monitored biochemical-\\nly to determine if the supplements are having their desiredeffects and are not causing additional adverse effects.\\nA treatment for a specific type of peroxisomal disor-\\nder includes bone marrow transplants for X-ALD, whichmay be effective if used early in the course of the child-hood form of the disease.\\nPhysical and psychological therapies are important\\nfor all types of peroxisomal disorders.\\nAlternative treatment\\nPatients with peroxisomal disorders, and particularly\\nX-ALD, have been treated with a mixture of glycerol tri-oleate-glycerol trieucate (4:1 by volume), prepared fromolive and rapeseed oils, and referred to as Lorenzo’s oil(developed by parents of a son, Lorenzo, who had X-ALD,whose story was documented in the 1992 movie, Lorenzo’s\\nOil), to decrease the levels of VLCFA. Other diets that\\nhave been tried include dietary supplementation with plas-malogen precursors to increase plasmalogen levels andwith cholic acid to normalize bile acids. However, there hasbeen only little success demonstrated with the use of thesetreatments. More research is needed to determine the long-term safety and effectiveness of these treatment strategies.\\nPrognosis\\nPeroxisomal disorders range from life-threatening to\\ncases in which people may function with some degree ofmental and motor retardation. As of 2001, there is not yeta cure. Enzyme replacement therapies, including enzymeinfusion, transplantation, and gene therapy , may hold\\npromise for future advances in the treatment of these dis-orders. Research is being conducted to increase scientificunderstanding of these disorders and to find ways to pre-vent, treat, and cure them.\\nPrevention\\nUnfortunately not enough is yet known about these\\ndiseases to develop comprehensive strategies for preven-tion.

As genes are identified that result in\\nthe disorders, genetic testing is being developed to iden-\\ntify carriers, who then can manage their reproduction toavoid the possibility of children being born with thesedeficiencies. As the genetic bases for the disorders isdefined, prenatal diagnosis and identification of carrierswill be facilitated. For example, for X-ALD, diagnosiscan be made from cultured skin fibroblasts or amnioticfluid cells. This allows prenatal diagnosis and carrieridentification in 90% of those affected. More recently ithas been shown that biochemical diagnosis can be per-formed through chorionic villi biopsy, a procedure per-formed very early in the first trimester of pregnancy .\\nAnimal models of ZS and X-ADL have been devel-\\noped and are providing researchers with methods to definepathogenic mechanisms and to evaluate new therapies.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nReddy, Janardan K., Tetsuya Suga, and Guy P.

DSM-IV specifies\\nthat these dysfunctional patterns must be regarded asnon-conforming or deviant by the person’s culture, andcause significant emotional pain and/or difficulties inrelationships and occupational performance. In addi-tion, the patient usually sees the disorder as being con-sistent with his or her self image (ego-syntonic) andmay blame others.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2562Personality disorders'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 269}, page_content='Description\\nTo meet the diagnosis of personality disorder, which\\nis sometimes called character disorder, the patient’sproblematic behaviors must appear in two or more of thefollowing areas:\\n• perception and interpretation of the self and other\\npeople\\n• intensity and duration of feelings and their appropriate-\\nness to situations\\n• relationships with others• ability to control impulses\\nPersonality disorders have their onset in late adoles-\\ncence or early adulthood. Doctors rarely give a diagnosisof personality disorder to children on the grounds thatchildren’s personalities are still in the process of forma-tion and may change considerably by the time they are intheir late teens. But, in retrospect, many individuals withpersonality disorders could be judged to have shown evi-dence of the problems in childhood.\\nIt is difficult to give close estimates of the percent-\\nage of the population that has personality disorders.Patients with certain personality disorders, includingantisocial and borderline disorders, are more likely to getinto trouble with the law or otherwise attract attentionthan are patients whose disorders chiefly affect theircapacity for intimacy. On the other hand, some patients,such as those with narcissistic or obsessive-compulsivepersonality disorders, may be outwardly successfulbecause their symptoms are useful within their particularoccupations. It has, however, been estimated that about15% of the general population of the United States has apersonality disorder, with higher rates in poor or troubledneighborhoods. The rate of personality disorders amongpatients in psychiatric treatment is between 30% and50%. It is possible for patients to have a so-called dualdiagnosis; for example, they may have more than onepersonality disorder, or a personality disorder togetherwith a substance-abuse problem.\\nBy contrast, DSM-IV classifies personality disorders\\ninto three clusters based on symptom similarities:\\n• Cluster A (paranoid, schizoid, schizotypal): Patients\\nappear odd or eccentric to others.\\n• Cluster B (antisocial, borderline, histrionic, narcissis-\\ntic): Patients appear overly emotional, unstable, or self-dramatizing to others.\\n• Cluster C (avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive):\\nPatients appear tense and anxiety-ridden to others.\\nThe DSM-IV clustering system does not mean that\\nall patients can be fitted neatly into one of the three clus-ters. It is possible for patients to have symptoms of more\\nthan one personality disorder or to have symptoms fromdifferent clusters.\\nSince the criteria for personality disorders include\\nfriction or conflict between the patient and his or hersocial environment, these syndromes are open to redefin-ition as societies change. Successive editions of DSM\\nhave tried to be sensitive to cultural differences, includ-ing changes over time, when defining personality disor-ders. One category that had been proposed for DSM-III-\\nR,self-defeating personality disorder, was excluded from\\nDSM-IV on the grounds that its definition reflected preju-\\ndice against women. DSM-IV recommends that doctors\\ntake a patient’s background, especially recent immigra-tion, into account before deciding that he or she has apersonality disorder. One criticism that has been made ofthe general category of personality disorder is that it isbased on Western notions of individual uniqueness. Itsapplicability to people from cultures with different defin-itions of human personhood is thus open to question.Furthermore, even within a culture, it can be difficult todefine the limits of “normalcy.”\\nThe personality disorders defined by DSM-IV are as\\nfollows:\\nParanoid\\nPatients with paranoid personality disorder are char-\\nacterized by suspiciousness and a belief that others areout to harm or cheat them. They have problems with inti-macy and may join cults or groups with paranoid beliefsystems. Some are litigious, bringing lawsuits againstthose they believe have wronged them. Although notordinarily delusional, these patients may develop psy-chotic symptoms under severe stress . It is estimated that\\n0.5–2.5% of the general population meet the criteria forparanoid personality disorder.\\nSchizoid\\nSchizoid patients are perceived by others as “loners”\\nwithout close family relationships or social contacts.Indeed, they are aloof and really do prefer to be alone.They may appear cold to others because they rarely dis-play strong emotions. They may, however, be successfulin occupations that do not require personal interaction.About 2% of the general population has this disorder. Itis slightly more common in men than in women.\\nSchizotypal\\nPatients diagnosed as schizotypal are often consid-\\nered odd or eccentric because they pay little attention totheir clothing and sometimes have peculiar speech man-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2563Personality disorders'),\n",

They are socially isolated and uncomfortable in\\nparties or other social gatherings. In addition, people withschizotypal personality disorder often have oddities ofthought, including “magical” beliefs or peculiar ideas (forexample, a belief in telepathy) that are outside of theircultural norms. It is thought that 3% of the general popu-lation has schizotypal personality disorder. It is slightlymore common in males. Schizotypal disorder should notbe confused with schizophrenia , although there is some\\nevidence that the disorders are genetically related.\\nAntisocial\\nPatients with antisocial personality disorder are\\nsometimes referred to as sociopaths or psychopaths.They are characterized by lying, manipulativeness, and aselfish disregard for the rights of others; some may actimpulsively. People with antisocial personality disorderare frequently chemically dependent and sexuallypromiscuous. It is estimated that 3% of males in the gen-eral population and 1% of females have antisocial per-sonality disorder.\\nBorderline\\nPatients with borderline personality disorder (BPD)\\nare highly unstable, with wide mood swings, a history ofintense but stormy relationships, impulsive behavior, andconfusion about career goals, personal values, or sexualorientation. These often highly conflictual ideas may cor-respond to an even deeper confusion about their sense ofself (identity). People with BPD frequently cut or burnthemselves, or threaten or attempt suicide. Many of thesepatients have histories of severe childhood abuse or\\nneglect. About 2% of the general population have BPD;75% of these patients are female.\\nHistrionic\\nPatients diagnosed with this disorder impress others\\nas overly emotional, overly dramatic, and hungry forattention. They may be flirtatious or seductive as a way ofdrawing attention to themselves, yet they are emotionallyshallow. Histrionic patients often live in a romantic fantasyworld and are easily bored with routine. About 2–3% ofthe population is thought to have this disorder. Althoughhistorically, in clinical settings, the disorder has been moreassociated with women, there may be bias toward diagnos-ing women with the histrionic personality disorder.\\nNarcissistic\\nNarcissistic patients are characterized by self-impor-\\ntance, a craving for admiration, and exploitative attitudestoward others. They have unrealistically inflated views oftheir talents and accomplishments, and may becomeextremely angry if they are criticized or outshone by oth-\\ners. Narcissists may be professionally successful butrarely have long-lasting intimate relationships. Fewerthan 1% of the population has this disorder; about 75%of those diagnosed with it are male.\\nAvoidant\\nPatients with avoidant personality disorder are fear-\\nful of rejection and shy away from situations or occupa-tions that might expose their supposed inadequacy. Theymay reject opportunities to develop close relationshipsbecause of their fears of criticism or humiliation. Patientswith this personality disorder are often diagnosed withdependent personality disorder as well. Many also fit thecriteria for social phobia. Between 0.5–1.0% of the pop-ulation have avoidant personality disorder.\\nDependent\\nDependent patients are afraid of being on their own\\nand typically develop submissive or compliant behaviorsin order to avoid displeasing people. They are afraid toquestion authority and often ask others for guidance ordirection. Dependent personality disorder is diagnosedmore often in women, but it has been suggested that thisfinding reflects social pressures on women to conform togender stereotyping or bias on the part of clinicians.\\nObsessive-compulsive\\nPatients diagnosed with this disorder are preoccupied\\nwith keeping order, attaining perfection, and maintainingmental and interpersonal control. They may spend a greatdeal of time adhering to plans, schedules, or rules fromwhich they will not deviate, even at the expense of open-ness, flexibility, and efficiency. These patients are oftenunable to relax and may become “workaholics.” Theymay have problems in employment as well as in intimaterelationships because they are very “stiff” and formal, andinsist on doing everything their way. About 1% of thepopulation has obsessive-compulsive personality disor-der; the male/female ratio is about 2:1.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPersonality disorders are thought to result from a bad\\ninterface, so to speak, between a child’s temperament andcharacter on one hand and his or her family environmenton the other. Temperament can be defined as a person’sinnate or biologically shaped basic disposition. Humaninfants vary in their sensitivity to light or noise, their levelof physical activity, their adaptability to schedules, andsimilar traits. Even traits such as “shyness” and “novelty-seeking” may be, at least in part, determined by the biolo-gy of the brain and the genes one inherits.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2564Personality disorders'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 271}, page_content='Character is defined as the set of attitudes and\\nbehavior patterns that the individual acquires or learnsover time. It includes such personal qualities as work andstudy habits, moral convictions, neatness or cleanliness,and consideration of others. Since children must learn toadapt to their specific families, they may develop person-ality disorders in the course of struggling to survive psy-chologically in disturbed or stressful families. For exam-ple, nervous or high-strung parents might be unhappywith a baby who is very active and try to restrain him orher at every opportunity. The child might then develop anavoidant personality disorder as the outcome of copingwith constant frustration and parental disapproval. Asanother example, child abuse is believed to play a role in\\nshaping borderline personality disorder. One reason thatsome therapists use the term developmental damageinstead of personality disorder is that it takes the pre-sumed source of the person’s problems into account.\\nSome patients with personality disorders come from\\nfamilies that appear to be stable and healthy. It has beensuggested that these patients are biologically hypersensi-tive to normal family stress levels. Levels of the brainchemical (neurotransmitter) dopamine may influence aperson’s level of novelty-seeking, and serotonin levelsmay influence aggression.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of personality disorders is complicated by\\nthe fact that affected persons rarely seek help until theyare in serious trouble or until their families (or the law)pressure them to get treatment. The reason for this slow-ness is that the problematic traits are so deeplyentrenched that they seem normal (ego-syntonic) to thepatient. Diagnosis of a personality disorder depends inpart on the patient’s age. Although personality disordersoriginate during the childhood years, they are consideredadult disorders. Some patients, in fact, are not diagnoseduntil late in life because their symptoms had been modi-fied by the demands of their job or by marriage. Afterretirement or the spouse’s death , however, these\\npatients’ personality disorders become fully apparent. Ingeneral, however, if the onset of the patient’s problem isin mid- or late-life, the doctor will rule out substanceabuse or personality change caused by medical or neuro-logical problems before considering the diagnosis of apersonality disorder. It is unusual for people to developpersonality disorders “out of the blue” in mid-life.\\nThere are no tests that can provide a definitive diag-\\nnosis of personality disorder. Most doctors will evaluatea patient on the basis of several sources of informationcollected over a period of time in order to determine howlong the patient has been having difficulties, how manyareas of life are affected, and how severe the dysfunction\\nis. These sources of information may include:\\nInterviews\\nThe doctor may schedule two or three interviews\\nwith the patient, spaced over several weeks or months, inorder to rule out an adjustment disorder caused by jobloss, bereavement, or a similar problem. An office inter-view allows the doctor to form an impression of thepatient’s overall personality as well as obtain informationabout his or her occupation and family. During the inter-view, the doctor will note the patient’s appearance, toneof voice, body language, eye contact, and other importantnon-verbal signals, as well as the content of the conver-sation. In some cases, the doctor may contact other peo-ple (family members, employers, close friends) whoknow the patient well in order to assess the accuracy ofthe patient’s perception of his or her difficulties. It isquite common for people with personality disorders tohave distorted views of their situations, or to be unawareof the impact of their behavior on others.\\nPsychologic testing\\nDoctors use psychologic testing to help in the diag-\\nnosis of a personality disorder. Most of these testsrequire interpretation by a professional with specializedtraining. Doctors usually refer patients to a clinical psy-chologist for this type of test.\\nPERSONALITY INVENTORIES. Personality inventories\\nare tests with true/false or yes/no answers that can be usedto compare the patient’s scores with those of people withknown personality distortions. The single most commonlyused test of this type is the Minnesota Multiphasic Per-\\nsonality Inventory , or MMPI. Another test that is often\\nused is the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory, or MCMI.\\nPROJECTIVE TESTS. Projective tests are unstructured.\\nUnstructured means that instead of giving one-wordanswers to questions, the patient is asked to talk at somelength about a picture that the psychologist has shownhim or her, or to supply an ending for the beginning of astory. Projective tests allow the clinician to assess thepatient’s patterns of thinking, fantasies, worries or anxi-eties, moral concerns, values, and habits. Common pro-jective tests include the Rorschach, in which the patientresponds to a set of ten inkblots; and the Thematic\\nApperception Test (TAT), in which the patient is shown\\ndrawings of people in different situations and then tells astory about the picture.\\nTreatment\\nAt one time psychiatrists thought that personality\\ndisorders did not respond very well to treatment.

More recently, how-ever, doctors have recognized that humans can continueto grow and change throughout life. Most patients withpersonality disorders are now considered to be treatable,although the degree of improvement may vary. The typeof treatment recommended depends on the personalitycharacteristics associated with the specific disorder.\\nHospitalization\\nInpatient treatment is rarely required for patients with\\npersonality disorders, with two major exceptions: border-line patients who are threatening suicide or suffering fromdrug or alcohol withdrawal; and patients with paranoidpersonality disorder who are having psychotic symptoms.\\nPsychotherapy\\nPsychoanalytic psychotherapy is suggested for\\npatients who can benefit from insight-oriented treatment.These patients typically include those with dependent,obsessive-compulsive, and avoidant personality disor-ders. Doctors usually recommend individual psychother-apy for narcissistic and borderline patients, but oftenrefer these patients to therapists with specialized trainingin these disorders. Psychotherapeutic treatment for per-sonality disorders may take as long as three to five years.\\nInsight-oriented approaches are not recommended\\nfor patients with paranoid or antisocial personality disor-ders. These patients are likely to resent the therapist andsee him or her as trying to control or dominate them.\\nSupportive therapy is regarded as the most helpful\\nform of psychotherapy for patients with schizoid person-ality disorder.\\nCognitive-behavioral therapy\\nCognitive-behavioral approaches are often recom-\\nmended for patients with avoidant or dependent person-ality disorders. Patients in these groups typically havemistaken beliefs about their competence or likableness.These assumptions can be successfully challenged bycognitive-behavioral methods.\\nGroup therapy\\nGroup therapy is frequently useful for patients with\\nschizoid or avoidant personality disorders because ithelps them to break out of their social isolation . It has\\nalso been recommended for patients with histrionic andantisocial personality disorders. These patients tend toact out, and pressure from peers in group treatment can\\nmotivate them to change. Because patients with antiso-cial personality disorder can destabilize groups thatinclude people with other disorders, it is usually best ifthese people meet exclusively with others who have APD(in “homogeneous” groups).\\nFamily therapy\\nFamily therapy may be suggested for patients\\nwhose personality disorders cause serious problems formembers of their families. It is also sometimes recom-mended for borderline patients from overinvolved or pos-sessive families.\\nMedications\\nMedications may be prescribed for patients with\\nspecific personality disorders. The type of medicationdepends on the disorder.\\nANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS. Antipsychotic drugs ,\\nsuch as haloperidol (Haldol), may be given to patientswith paranoid personality disorder if they are havingbrief psychotic episodes. Patients with borderline orschizotypal personality disorder are sometimes givenantipsychotic drugs in low doses; however, the efficacyof these drugs in treating personality disorder is less clearthan in schizophrenia.\\nMOOD STABILIZERS. Carbamazepine (Tegretol) is a\\ndrug that is commonly used to treat seizures, but is alsohelpful for borderline patients with rage outbursts andsimilar behavioral problems. Lithium and valproate mayalso be used as mood stabilizers, especially among peo-ple with borderline personality disorder.\\nANTIDEPRESSANTS AND ANTI-ANXIETY MEDICA-\\nTIONS. Medications in these categories are sometimes\\nprescribed for patients with schizoid personality disorderto help them manage anxiety symptoms while they are in\\npsychotherapy. Antidepressants are also commonly usedto treat people with borderline personality disorder.\\nTreatment with medications is not recommended for\\npatients with avoidant, histrionic, dependent, or narcis-sistic personality disorders. The use of potentially addic-tive medications should be avoided in people with bor-derline or antisocial personality disorders. However,some avoidant patients who also have social phobia maybenefit from monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO\\ninhibitors), a particular class of antidepressant.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for recovery depends in part on the\\nspecific disorder.

Others, particularly schizoidpatients, have better prognoses if they are given appropri-ate treatment. Patients with paranoid personality disorderare at some risk for developing delusional disorders orschizophrenia. The personality disorders with the poorestprognoses are the antisocial and the borderline. Border-line patients are at high risk for developing substanceabuse disorders or bulimia. About 80% of hospitalizedborderline patients attempt suicide at some point duringtreatment, and about 5% succeed in committing suicide.\\nPrevention\\nThe most effective preventive strategy for personali-\\nty disorders is early identification and treatment of chil-dren at risk.

They are grouped together because of thesimilarities between them. The three most common sharedproblems involve communication skills, motor skills, andsocial skills. Since there are no clear diagnostic boundariesseparating these conditions it is sometimes difficult to dis-tinguish one from the other for diagnostic purposes.\\nAsperger’s syndrome, autistic disorder, and child-\\nhood disintegrative disorder are four to five times morecommon in boys, and Rett’s syndrome has been diag-nosed primarily in girls. All of these disorders are rare.\\nDescription\\nAsperger’s syndrome\\nChildren afflicted with Asperger’s syndrome exhibit\\ndifficulties in social relationships and communication.They are reluctant to make eye contact, do not respond tosocial or emotional contacts, do not initiate play activi-ties with peers, and do not give or receive attention oraffection. To receive this diagnosis the individual mustdemonstrate normal development of language, thinkingand coping skills. Due to an impaired coordination ofmuscle movements, they appear to be clumsy. They usu-ally become deeply involved in a very few interestswhich tend to occupy most of their time and attention.\\nAutistic disorder\\nAutistic disorder is frequently evident within the\\nfirst year of life, and must be diagnosed before age three.It is associated with moderate mental retardation in\\nthree out of four cases. These children do not want to beheld, rocked, cuddled or played with. They are unrespon-sive to affection, show no interest in peers or adults andhave few interests. Other traits include avoidance of eyecontact, an expressionless face and the use of gestures toexpress needs. Their actions are repetitive, routine andrestricted. Rocking, hand and arm flapping, unusual handand finger movements, and attachment to objects ratherthan pets and people are common. Speech, play, andother behaviors are repetitive and without imagination.They tend to be overactive, aggressive, and self-injuri-ous. They are often highly sensitive to touch, noise, andsmells and do not like changes in routine.\\nChildhood disintegrative disorder\\nChildhood disintegrative disorder is also called\\nHeller’s disease and most often develops between twoand ten years of age. Children with CDD develop nor-mally until two to three years of age and then begin todisintegrate rapidly. Signs and symptoms include deteri-oration of the ability to use and understand language to\\nthe point where they are unable to carry on a conversa-tion. This is accompanied by the loss of control of thebladder and bowels. Any interest or ability to play andengage in social activities is lost. The behaviors are near-ly identical with those that are characteristic of autisticdisorder. However, childhood disintegrative disorderbecomes evident later in life and results in developmentalregression, or loss of previously attained skills, whereasautistic disorder can be detected as early as the firstmonth of life and results in a failure to progress.\\nPervasive developmental disorder not otherwise\\nspecified\\nThe term pervasive developmental disorder not oth-\\nerwise specified (PDDNOS) is also referred to as atypi-cal personality development, atypical PDD, or atypicalautism. Individuals with this disorder share some of thesame signs and symptoms of autism or other conditions\\nunder the category of pervasive developmental disor-ders, but do not meet all of the criteria for diagnosis forany of the four syndromes included in this group of dis-eases. Because the children diagnosed with PDDNOSdo not all exhibit the same combination of characteris-tics, it is difficult to do research on this disorder, but thelimited evidence available suggests that patients are seenby medical professionals later in life than is the case forautistic children, and they are less likely to have intellec-tual deficits.\\nRett’s syndrome\\nRett’s syndrome was first described in 1966 and is\\nfound almost exclusively in girls. It is a disease in whichcells in the brain experience difficulty in communicatingwith each other. At the same time the growth of the headfalls behind the growth of the body so that these childrenare usually mentally retarded. These conditions areaccompanied by deficits in movement (motor) skills anda loss of interest in social activities.\\nThe course of the illness has been divided into four\\nstages. In stage one the child develops normally for six to18 months. In stage two, development slows down andstops. Stage three is characterized by a loss of the speechand motor skills already acquired. Typically this happensbetween nine months and three years of age. Stage fourbegins with a return to learning which will continueacross the lifespan, but at a very slow rate. Problems withcoordination and walking are likely to continue and evenworsen. Other conditions that can occur with Rett’s syn-drome are convulsions, constipation , breathing prob-\\nlems, impaired circulation in the feet and legs, and diffi-culty chewing or swallowing.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2568Pervasive developmental disorders'),\n",

Still, no single brain abnormality or location hasbeen connected to a cause. Rett’s syndrome demonstratesthe strongest evidence that it is caused by the mutation ofa gene. Research with twins has indicated that geneticsmay also play a role in the cause of autism. A number ofneurological conditions, such as convulsions, are com-monly found to accompany these disorders.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder\\nis made by medical specialists based on a thoroughexamination of the patient, including observing behaviorand gathering information from parents and caregivers.Because many symptoms are common to more than onecondition, distinctions between conditions must be care-fully made. The following summary describes the dis-tinction between three common disorders.\\nPDDNOS:\\n• impairment of two-way social interaction• repetitive and predictable behavior patterns and activi-\\nties\\nAutism:\\n• all listed for PDDNOS• severe impairment in communication• abnormal social interaction and use of language for social\\ncommunication or imaginative play before age of three\\n• not better accounted for by another psychiatric order.\\nAsperger’s disorder:\\n• all listed for PDDNOS• clinically significant impairment in social, occupation-\\nal, or other areas of functioning\\n• no general delay in language\\n• no delay in cognitive development, self-help skills, or\\nadaptive behavior\\n• not better accounted for by another pervasive develop-\\nmental disorder or schizophrenia\\nRett’s syndrome:\\n• a period of normal development between 6–18 months• normal head circumference at birth, followed by a\\nslowing of head growth\\n• retardation• repetitive hand movementsCDD:\\n• normal development for at least two years\\n• loss of skills in at least two of the following areas: lan-\\nguage, social skills, bowel or bladder control, play,movement skills\\n• abnormal functioning in at least two of the following\\nareas: social interaction, communication, behavior pat-terns\\n• not better accounted for by another PDD or mental ill-\\nness\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for children with pervasive developmental\\ndisorders is limited. Those who can be enrolled in educa-tional programs will need a highly structured learningenvironment, a teacher-student ratio of not more than 1:2,and a high level of parental involvement that provides con-sistent care at home. Psychotherapy and social skills train-ing can prove helpful to some. There is no specific med-ication available for treating the core symptoms of any ofthese disorders, though research is promising. Some psy-chiatric medications may be helpful in controlling particu-lar behavior difficulties, such as agitation, mood instabili-ty, and self-injury. Music, massage, and hydrotherapy\\nmay exert a calming effect on behavior. Treatment mayalso include physical and occupational therapy.\\nPrognosis\\nIn general, the prognosis in all of these conditions is\\ntied to the severity of the illness.\\nThe prognosis for Asperger’s syndrome is more\\nhopeful than that for other diseases in this cluster. Thesechildren are likely to grow up to be functional indepen-dent adults, but will always have problems with socialrelationships. They are also at greater risk for developingserious mental illness than the general population.\\nThe prognosis for autistic disorder is not as good,\\nalthough great strides have been made in recent years inits treatment. The higher the patient’s IQ (intelligencequotient) and ability to communicate, the better the prog-nosis. However, many patients will always need somelevel of custodial care. In the past, most of these individ-uals were confined to institutions, but many are now ableto live in group homes or supervised apartments. Theprognosis for childhood disintegrative disorder is evenless favorable. These children will require intensive andlong-term care. Children diagnosed with PDDNOS havea better prognosis because their initial symptoms are usu-ally milder, IQ scores are higher, and language develop-ment is stronger.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2569Pervasive developmental disorders'),\n",

Thepresence of the therapy animals produced a beneficialeffect on both children and adults with mental healthissues.

Endorphins react with opiatereceptors in the brain to reduce pain sensations.contractures . Some cases are associated with diabetes,\\nand others appear after prostate surgery. Because prostatesurgery always requires a catheter in the bladder, there issome suspicion that catheters can cause the scarring.However, many cases of Peyronie’s disease arise withoutany use of a catheter. There is also a congenital form ofpenile deviation, again with no known cause. Most of thescars are located in the mid-line, therefore most of theangulations are either up or down.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPeyronie’s disease occurs in about 1% of men, most of\\nthem between 45-60 years old. Although there is no goodresearch data to back it up, the suspicion exists that Pey-ronie’s disease is the result of injury. If not a catheter, thensudden, forceful bending during sexual intercourse couldeasily tear the supporting tissues and lead to scarring.\\nThe symptom is bending of an erect penis, some-\\ntimes with pain . It often interferes with sexual inter-\\ncourse. Erectile failure associated with the angulationoften precedes it.\\nTreatment\\nAttempts have been made to reduce the angulation\\nwith injections of cortisone-like drugs directly into thescar, but they are rarely successful. Surgery seems to bethe better answer. After the scar is removed, plastic repairof the penis is attempted, often with a graft of tissue fromsomewhere else on the body. The Nesbit procedure is oneof the more successful methods of doing this. The othersurgical approach is to implant a penile prosthesis thatovercomes the angulation mechanically. Results withthese procedures are reported to be 60–80% satisfactory,including the return of orgasm.\\nPrognosis\\nSometimes the condition disappears spontaneously.\\nA careful look for other causes of impotence should be\\ndone before surgery.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nJordan, Gerald H., et al. “Surgery of the Penis and Urethra.” In\\nCampbell’s Urology , ed.

In humans, genesinfluence race, hair and eye color, gender, height, weight,aspects of behavior, and even the likelihood of developingcertain diseases. Although some traits are a combination ofgenetics and environment, researchers are still discoveringnew ways in which people are affected by their genes.\\nPharmacogenetics is the study of how people\\nrespond to drug therapy.

Genes can also alter the risk of developingdifferent diseases. It has long been known that people ofAfrican descent were more likely to have sickle cell ane-mia than people of other races. People of Armenian, Arab,and Turkish heritage are more prone to familiar Mediter-ranean fever than people of other nationalities. More\\nrecently, discoveries have shown that genes can determineother aspects of each individual, down to the level of theenzymes produced in the liver. Since these enzymesdetermine how quickly a drug is removed from the body,they can make major differences in the way peoplerespond to drugs. Some of the most basic work concernsthe way race and gender influence drug reactions—andrace and gender are genetically determined.\\nWomen often respond differently than men to drugs at\\nthe same dose levels. For example, women are more likelyto have a good response to the antidepressant drugs that\\nact as serotonin specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, thegroup that includes Prozac and Paxil) than they are to theolder group of tricyclic antidepressants (the group thatincludes Elavil and Tofranil). Women have a greaterresponse to some narcotic pain reliving drugs than do\\nmen, but get less relief from some non-narcotic pain med-ications. Women may show a greater response to somesteroid hormones than men do, but have a lower level ofresponse to some anti-anxiety medications than men.\\nRace may also affect the way people respond to some\\nmedications. In this case, race implies specific genetic fac-tors that are generally, but not always, found among mem-bers of specific ethnic groups. For example, the angiotensinII inhibitor enalopril (Vasotec), which is used to lowerblood pressure, works better in Caucasians than in Blacks.Carvedilol (Coreg), a beta-adrenergic blocking agent that isalso used to lower blood pressure, is more effective thanother drugs in the same class when used to treat Blackpatients. Black patients with heart failure appear to\\nrespond better to a combination of hydralazine and isosor-bide than do Caucasian patients using the same medication.\\nMore specific research has identified individual\\ngenes than may influence drugs response, without rely-ing on group information such as gender and race. Spe-cific genes have been identified that may determine howpatients will respond to specific drugs. For example,some genes may determine whether people will get painrelief from codeine, or how well they will respond todrugs used to treat cancer .\\nCauses and symptoms\\nGenes alter responses to drugs because the genes\\ninfluence many parts of the body iteself.

Since many drugs are soluble in body fat, peo-ple with large amounts of fat will have these drugdeposited into their fat stores. This means that there arelower levels of the drug that can reach the actual organson which they work.\\nIn the case of gender responses to antidepressants,\\nwomen show greater response to serotonin specific anti-depressants because women naturally have lower levelsof serotonin than men do. This makes women more like-ly to develop a type of depression marked by low sero-tonin levels, but it also means that women will respondbetter to replacement of serotonin.\\nBecause people of the same race carry similar\\ngenes, studies based on race were the earliest types ofpharmacogenetic studies. One study evaluated the lev-els of alcohol dehydrogenase in people of differentnationalities. This is an enzyme involved in the metabo-lism of alcohol. When people with high levels of thisenzyme, or people in whom the enzyme acts morerapidly than in other people, drink alcohol, they aresubject to facial flushing and slowing of the heartbeat.The activity of this enzyme is determined by genetics,and different levels can be seen in different racesbecause these people belong to the same gene pools.Among Asiatic people, 85% have high levels of thisenzyme, compared to 20% of Swiss people, and only5–10% of British people.\\nAnother trait that is influenced by genes is a liver\\nenzyme, CYP2D6. This enzyme metabolizes some drugsby converting them to a form that can be removed fromthe body. Genes determine the level of this enzyme in theliver. People with low levels of CYP2D6 will metabolizedrugs slowly. Slow metabolism means the drugs will actfor a longer peiod of time. Slow metabolizers reaspond tosmaller doses of medications that are eliminated by thisenzyme, while fast metabolizers, people who have a lotof the enzyme, will need larger drug doses to get thesame effects. At the same time, low levels of CYP2D6means that people taking the drugs that are metabolizedby this enzyme will have higher drug levels, and aremore likely to have unwanted side effects.\\nAnother enzyme that can be important in drug dos-\\ning is called 2C9, and this enzyme is responsible formetabolizing the anticoagulant drug warfarin(Coumadin). Most people take warfarin in a dose ofabout 5 milligrams a day, but people who have low lev-els of 2C9 normally require a dose of only 1-5 mil-ligrams a week.\\nYet another mechanism of drug activity is the pres-\\nence or absence of a specific drug receptor sites. Drugsact by binding to specific chemicals, receptor sites, withinbody cells. Genes may help determine how many of these\\ncells there are. The action of the widely used antipsychot-ic drug haloperidol (Haldol) depends on its ability to bindto the dopamine (D2) receptor site. The number of thesesites are determined by genetics. In one study, 63% ofpatients whose genes caused a large number of thesereceptor sites had a response to treatment with haloperi-dol, while only about 29% of patients with a smaller num-ber of dopamine (D2) receptor sites did well on the drug.\\nOther genetic studies indicate that genes may affect\\nhow people respond to foods as well as to drugs. An Aus-tralian study of osteoporosis (softening of the bones that\\noften occurs in elderly people) reported that separategenes may affect response to vitamin D, calcium, andestrogens.\\nImplications\\nAlthough the study is still new, pharmacogenetics\\npromises to offer great benefits in drug effectiveness andsafety.\\nAt the present time, most drug treatment is done by\\ntrial and error. Physicians prescribe medication, and thepatient tries the drug. The drug may work, or it may not.It may cause adverse effects, or it may be safe. If thedrug does not work, the dose is increased. If it causesharmful or unpleasant effects, a new drug is tried until,finally, the right drug is found. In some cases this proce-dure may take weeks or even months.\\nIn other cases, drugs are carefully tested, and appear\\nto be safe and effective. Only after they are approved forgeneral use are reports of serious adverse effects that didnot appear in the initial studies documented. This canoccur if there is a rare gene that affects the way in whichthe drug acts, or the way in which the drug is metabolized.\\nWith increasing understanding of how genes deter-\\nmine the way people respond to drugs, it will be possibleto select drugs and doses based on a greater understand-ing of each individual patient. This promises more effec-tive drug therapy, with greater safety and fewer treatmentfailures.\\nPhysicians may be able to compare the person’s\\ngenetic make-up with the properties of specific drugs,and make informed decisions about which drug in agroup will work most effectively or most safely.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nFrom genome to therapy: Integrating new technologies with\\ndrug development.

PKU is sometimes calledFolling’s disease in honor of Dr. Asbjorn Folling whofirst described it in 1934.KEY TERMS\\nEnzyme —Proteins produced by living cells that\\nhelp produce specific biochemical reactions in thebody.\\nMetabolism —The process by which foods and\\ndrugs are broken down for use and removal fromthe body.\\nSickle cell anemia —A severe, inheritable disease,\\nmost common among people of African descent,marked by deformation and destruction of redblood cells, and by adherence of blood cells to thewalls of blood vessels.Description\\nPhenylalanine is an essential amino acid. These sub-\\nstances are called “essential” because the body must getthem from food to build the proteins that make up its tis-sues and keep them working. Therefore, phenylalanine isrequired for normal development. Phenylalanine is acommon amino acid and is found in all natural foods.However, natural foods contain more phenylalanine thanrequired for normal development. This level is too highfor patients with PKU, making a special low-phenylala-nine diet a requirement.\\nThe incidence of PKU is approximately one in every\\n15,000 births (1/15,000). There are areas in the worldwhere the incidence is much higher, particularly Irelandand western Scotland. In Ireland the incidence of PKU is1/4,500 births. This is the highest incidence in the worldand supports a theory that the genetic defect is very oldand of Celtic origin. Countries with very little immigra-tion from Ireland or western Scotland tend to have lowrates of PKU. In Finland, the incidence is less than1/100,000 births. Caucasians in the United States have aPKU incidence of 1/8,000, whereas Blacks have an inci-dence of 1/50,000.\\nRelated diseases:\\nMaternal phenylketonuria is a condition in which a\\nhigh level of phenylalanine in a mother’s blood causesmental retardation in her child when in the womb. Awoman who has PKU and is not using a special low-phenylalanine diet will have high levels of phenylalaninein her blood. Her high phenylalanine levels will cross theplacenta and affect the development of her child. Themajority of children born from these pregnancies arementally retarded and have physical problems, includingsmall head size (microcephaly) and congenital heart\\ndisease . Most of these children do not have PKU. There\\nis no treatment for maternal phenylketonuria. Control ofmaternal phenylalanine levels is thought to limit theeffects of maternal phenylketonuria.\\nHyperphenylalaninemia is a condition in which\\npatients have high levels of phenylalanine in their blood,but not as high as seen in patients with classical PKU.There are two forms of hyperphenylalaninemia: mild andsevere. In the mild form of the disease, patients havephenylalanine blood levels of less than 10 mg/dl, evenwhen eating a normal diet (0.6–1.5 mg/dl is consideredthe normal range). There are few effects from the mildform of the disease. In the severe form of the hyper-phenylalaninemia, patients have higher levels of pheny-lalanine in their blood. The severe form is distinguishedfrom classical PKU by testing for the presence of pheny-lalanine hydroxylase (an enzyme that breaks down\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2575Phenylketonuria'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 282}, page_content='phenylalanine) in the liver. Classic PKU patients lack\\nthis enzyme in their liver, while patients with severehyperphenylalaninemia have some enzyme activity, butat greatly reduced levels compared with normal persons.Patients with severe hyperphenylalaninemia are treatedwith the same diet as classical PKU patients.\\nTyrosinemia is characterized by high levels of two\\namino acids in the blood, phenylalanine and tyrosine.Patients with this disease have many of the same symp-toms as seen in classical PKU, including mental retarda-tion. Treatment consists of a special diet similar to thediet for PKU. The main difference between the two diets\\nis that patients with tyrosinemia must eat a diet that islow in both phenylalanine and tyrosine.\\nTetrahydrobiopterin deficiency disease is another\\nmetabolic disorder. Patients with this disease also havehigh levels of phenylalanine in their blood. Althoughphenylalanine levels can be controlled by diet, thesepatients still have mental retardation because they do notmake enough of the neurotransmitters dopamine andserotonin, which are essential for proper neurologicfunction.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe underlying cause of PKU is mutation in the\\ngene that tells the body to make the enzyme phenylala-nine hydroxylase. This enzyme allows the body to breakdown phenylalanine and ultimately use it to build pro-teins. Normally, the first step in phenylalanine metabo-lism is conversion to tyrosine, another amino acid. Thegenetic mutations result in no enzyme or poor qualityenzyme being made. As a consequence, phenylalanine isnot converted and builds up in the body. The high levelsof phenylalanine can be detected in the blood and urine.\\nPKU is an autosomal recessive genetic disease. A\\nchild must inherit abnormal genes from both parents todevelop PKU. A person with one abnormal gene and onegood gene will develop normally because the good genewill make sufficient phenylalanine hydroxylase. Peoplewith one good gene are called carriers because they donot have the disease, but are capable of passing theabnormal gene on to their children.\\nIf both parents are carriers of abnormal phenylala-\\nnine hydroxylase genes, then the chances of their childhaving PKU is one in four or 25%. The chances that theirchild will be a carrier is two in four, or 50%. These per-centages hold for each pregnancy .\\nThe gene for phenylalanine hydroxylase is found on\\nchromosome 12. There are many different mutation siteson the gene for phenylalanine hydroxylase. The mutationslead to a range of errors in the enzyme, including lack ofthe enzyme. The exact mechanism by which excess\\nphenylalanine causes mental retardation is not known.\\nChildren with PKU appear normal at birth, but\\ndevelop irreversible mental retardation unless treatedearly. Treatment consists of a special diet that containsvery little phenylalanine. This diet must be used through-out the patient’s life. Untreated newborns develop dis-ease symptoms at age three to five months. At first theyappear to be less attentive and may have problems eating.By one year of age, they are mentally retarded.\\nPatients with PKU tend to have lighter colored skin,\\nhair, and eyes than other family members. They are alsolikely to have eczema and seizures. PKU patients have avariety of neurologic symptoms. Approximately 75-90%of PKU patients have abnormal electrocardiograms(ECGs), which measure the activity of their heart. Theirsweat and urine may have a “mousy” smell that is causedby phenylacetic acid, a byproduct of phenylalanine metab-olism. Untreated PKU children tend to be hyperactive anddemonstrate loss of contact with reality ( psychosis ).\\nDiagnosis\\nPKU must be detected shortly after birth. Although\\nchildren with PKU appear normal at birth, they alreadyhave high phenylalanine levels. Screening is the only wayto detect PKU before symptoms start to develop. In manyareas of the world, screening newborns for PKU is per-formed routinely. The test is typically performed betweenone and seven days after birth. Blood is obtained bypricking the heel of the newborn and analyzing it forphenylalanine concentration. Very high levels of pheny-lalanine indicate that there is a problem with phenylala-nine hydroxylase. There is no established level of pheny-lalanine that is considered diagnostic for PKU. Blood lev-els above 20 mg/dl are generally associated with classicalPKU. The generally accepted upper limit for normal innewborns is 2 mg/dl, with most unaffected children hav-ing levels below 1 mg/dl. Patients with high blood levelsof phenylalanine are tested further to distinguish betweenclassic PKU and related diseases.\\nThe Guthrie Inhibition Assay is usually used to test\\nfor blood phenylalanine levels. (An assay compares sam-ples from the body to a reference standard of known con-centration to determine the relative strength of the sub-stance in the samples.) The test uses a special strain ofthe bacterium Bacillus subtilis that requires phenylala-\\nnine for growth. The bacterium is grown on the surfaceof a special medium that lacks phenylalanine. Paperdisks containing blood samples and testing standards areplaced on top of the agar plate, and the bacteria areallowed to grow. The amount of growth around each diskis proportional to the amount of phenylalanine in the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2576Phenylketonuria'),\n",

(These metabolites are the prod-ucts of phenylalanine when it’s broken down and used bythe body.) These metabolites first appear four to sixweeks after birth and are detected by the addition of afew drops of a 10% ferric chloride solution to a urinesample. If the metabolites are present, a deep bluishgreen color develops. Color development indicates thatthe patient has PKU.\\nPrenatal diagnosis can be done for families with a\\nhistory of PKU. The test is performed by collectingamniotic fluid or chorionic villus cells and analyzing theDNA for the presence of genetic mutations indicative ofPKU. Amniotic fluid cells are collected by inserting aneedle through a woman’s abdomen and womb and with-drawing some of the amniotic fluid that surrounds thefetus. Chorionic villus cells are obtained by inserting acatheter through the cervix and into the outer membranethat surrounds the uterus.\\nTreatment\\nThe only treatment for persons with PKU is to limit\\nthe amount of phenylalanine in their diet. PKU patientsshould eat a special diet that is low in phenylalanine. Thediet has small amounts of phenylalanine because it isessential for normal growth and development. The dietshould be started before the fourth week of life to preventmental retardation. If started early enough, the diet is 75%effective in preventing severe mental retardation. Manynatural foods, including breast milk, must be avoidedbecause they contain more phenylalanine than PKUpatients can tolerate. However, low protein, natural foods,including fruits, vegetables, and some cereals, are accept-able on the diet. Monitoring of blood phenylalanine levelsmust be done to ensure that normal levels are maintained.\\nPatients who make a small amount of phenylalanine\\nhydroxylase can eat a limited amount of regular food iftheir phenylalanine levels remain within an acceptablerange. Low-phenylalanine and phenylalanine-free foodsare available commercially. The special diet must be usedthroughout the patient’s life. At one time it was thoughtacceptable to stop the diet when the brain was fully devel-oped. However, reports of decreases in IQ and develop-ment of learning and behavior problems in patients whostopped the diet have essentially ended this practice.\\nResources\\nOTHER\\n“Education of Students with Phenylketonuria (PKU).” National\\nInstitutes of Health. <http://www.nih.gov>.\\n“Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders.” The Meck Page. 13 Apr.\\n1998 <http://www.merck.com>.KEY TERMS\\nAmino acids —The building blocks of protein.\\nMetabolism —The sum of the many processes by\\nwhich the body uses food and energy to build tis-sues and carry out the functions of life.\\nPhenylalanine —One of the amino acids that the\\nbody must take in through food in order to buildthe proteins needed for normal growth and func-tioning.\\nOMIM Home Page, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man.\\n<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Omim>.\\nJohn T.

Most(90%) are benign tumors so they do not spread to otherparts of the body. However, these tumors can cause manyproblems and if they are not treated and can result in death .\\nPheochromocytomas can be found anywhere chro-\\nmaffin cells are found. They may be found in the heart andin the area around the bladder, but most (90%) are found inthe adrenal glands. Every individual has two adrenalglands that are located above the kidneys in the back of theabdomen. Each adrenal gland is made up of two parts: theouter part (called the adrenal cortex) and the inner part(called the adrenal medulla). Pheochromocytomas arefound in the adrenal medulla. The adrenal medulla nor-mally secretes two substances, or hormones, called norepi-nephrine and epinephrine. These two substances, whenconsidered together, are known as adrenaline. Adrenalineis released from the adrenal gland, enters the bloodstream\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2577Pheochromocytoma'),\n",

Pheochromocytomas causethe adrenal medulla to secrete too much adrenaline, whichin turn causes high blood pressure. The high blood pres-sure usually causes the other symptoms of the disease.\\nPheochromocytomas are rare tumors. They have\\nbeen reported in babies as young as five days old as wellas adults 92 years old. Although they can be found at anytime during life, they usually occur in adults between 30and 40 years of age. Pheochromocytomas are somewhatmore common in women than in men.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of most pheochromocytomas is not\\nknown. A small minority (about 10-20%) of pheochromo-cytomas arise because a person has an inherited suscepti-bility to them. Inherited pheochromocytomas are associ-ated with four separate syndromes: Multiple EndocrineNeoplasia, type 2A (MEN2A), Multiple Endocrine Neo-plasia, type 2B (MEN2B), von Hippel-Lindau disease(VHL) and Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).\\nIndividuals with pheochromocytomas as part of any\\nof these four syndromes usually have other medical con-ditions as well. People with MEN2A often have cancer\\n(usually thyroid cancer ) and other hormonal problems.\\nIndividuals with MEN2B can also have cancer and hor-monal problems, but also have other abnormal physicalfeatures. Both MEN2A and MEN2B are due to geneticalterations or mutations in a gene called RET, found atchromosome 10q11.2. Individuals with VHL often haveother benign tumors of the central nervous system andpancreas, and can sometimes have renal cell cancer. Thissyndrome is caused by a mutation in the VHL gene,found at chromosome 3p25-26. Individuals with NF1often have neurofibromas (benign tumors of the periph-eral nervous system). NF1 is caused by mutations in theNF1 gene, found at chromosome 17q11.\\nAll of these disorders are inherited in an autosomal\\ndominant inheritance pattern. With autosomal dominantinheritance, men and women are equally likely to inheritthe syndrome. In addition, children of individuals withthe disease are at 50% risk of inheriting it. Genetic test-\\ningis available for these four syndromes (MEN2A,\\nMEN2B, VHL and NF1) but, due to the complexity,genetic counseling should be considered before testing.\\nMost people (90%) with pheochromocytoma have\\nhypertension , or high blood pressure. The other symp-\\ntoms of the disease are extremely variable. These symp-toms usually occur in episodes (or attacks) called parox-ysms and include:\\n• headaches• excess sweating\\n• racing heart\\n• rapid breathing\\n• anxiety/nervousness• nervous shaking• pain in the lower chest or upper abdomen\\n• nausea\\n• heat intolerance\\nThe episodes can occur as often as 25 times a day or,\\nas infrequently as once every few months. They can last afew minutes, several hours, or days. Usually, the attacksoccur several times a week and last for about 15 minutes.After the episode is over, the person feels exhausted andfatigued.\\nBetween the attacks, people with pheochromocy-\\ntoma can experience the following:\\n• increased sweating\\n• cold hands and feet• weight loss\\n• constipation\\nDiagnosis\\nIf a pheochromocytoma is suspected, urine and/or a\\nblood test are usually recommended. A test called “24-hour urinary catacholamines and metanephrines” will bedone. This test is designed to look for adrenaline and thebreak-down products of adrenaline. Since the body getsrid of these hormones in the urine, those testing will needto collect their urine for 24 hours. The laboratory willdetermine whether or not the levels of hormones are toohigh. This test is very good at making the diagnosis ofpheochromocytoma. Another test called “serum cata-cholamines” measures the level of adrenaline com-pounds in the blood. It is not as sensitive as the 24-hoururine test, but can still provide some key information if itshows that the level of adrenaline compounds is too high.\\nOne of the difficulties with these tests is that a per-\\nson needs to have an attack of symptoms either duringthe 24-hour urine collection time period or shortly beforethe blood is drawn for a serum test to ensure the test’saccuracy. If a person did not have an episode during thattime, the test can be a “false negative”. If a doctor sus-pects the patient has had a “false negative” test, addition-al tests called “pharmacologic tests” can be ordered.During these tests, a specific drug is given to the patient(usually through an IV) and the levels of hormones aremonitored from the patient’s blood. These types of testsare only done rarely.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2578Pheochromocytoma'),\n",

The imaging tech-niques used are usually computed tomography scan (CTscan) and magnetic resonsance imaging (MRI). A CTscan creates pictures of the interior of the body from com-puter-analyzed differences in x rays passing through thebody. CT scans are performed at a hospital or clinic andtake only a few minutes. An MRI is a computerized scan-ning method that creates pictures of the interior of thebody using radio waves and a magnet. An MRI is usuallyperformed at a hospital and takes about 30 minutes.\\nTreatment\\nOnce a pheochromocytoma is found, more tests will\\nbe done to see if the tumor is benign (not cancer) ormalignant (cancer). If the tumor is malignant, tests willbe done to see how far the cancer has spread. There is noaccepted staging system for pheochromocytoma; but anobservation of the tumor could provide one of these fourindications:\\n• Localized benign pheochromocytoma means that the\\ntumor is found only in one area, is not cancer, and can-not spread to other tissues of the body.\\n• Regional pheochromocytoma means that the tumor is\\nmalignant and has spread to the lymph nodes aroundthe original cancer. Lymph nodes are small structuresfound all over the body that make and store infection-fighting cells.\\n• Metastatic pheochromocytoma means that the tumor is\\nmalignant and has spread to other, more distant parts ofthe body.\\n• Recurrent pheochromocytoma means that a malignant\\ntumor that was removed has come back.\\nTreatment in all cases begins with surgical removal\\nof the tumor. Before surgery, medications such as alpha-adrenergic blockers are given to block the effect of thehormones and normalize blood pressure. These medica-tions are usually started seven to 10 days prior to surgery.The surgery of choice is laparoscopic laparotomy, whichis a minimally invasive outpatient procedure performedunder general or local anesthesia. A small incision ismade in the abdomen, the laparoscope is inserted, andthe tumor is removed. The patient can usually return tonormal activities within two weeks. If a laparoscopiclaparotomy cannot be done, a traditional laparotomy willbe performed. This is a more invasive surgery done underspinal or general anesthesia and requires five to sevendays in the hospital. Usually patients are able to return tonormal activities after four weeks. After surgery, bloodand urine tests will be done to make sure hormone levelsKEY TERMS\\nAdrenal medulla —The central core of the adrenal\\ngland.\\nLaparoscope —An instrument used to examine\\nbody cavities during certain types of surgery; forexample, surgeries to remove fibroid tumors orgall bladders are often performed through thenavel rather than cutting into the body.\\nParoxysm —A sudden attack of symptoms.\\nreturn to normal. If the hormone levels are still above\\nnormal, it may mean that some tumor tissue was notremoved. If not all tumor can be removed (as in malig-nant pheochromocytoma, for example) drugs will begiven to control high blood pressure.\\nIf a pheochromocytoma is malignant, radiation\\ntherapy and/or chemotherapy may be used. Radiation\\ntherapy uses high-energy x rays to kill cancer cells andshrink tumors. Because there is no evidence that radiationtherapy is effective in the treatment of malignantpheochromocytoma, it is not often used for treatment.However, it is useful in the treatment of painful bonemetastases if the tumor has spread to the bones.Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Like radia-tion therapy, it has not been shown to be effective in thetreatment of malignant pheochromocytoma. Chemothera-py, therefore, is only used in rare instances.\\nUntreated pheochromocytoma can be fatal due to\\ncomplications of the high blood pressure. In the vastmajority of cases, when the tumor is surgically removed,pheochromocytoma is cured. In the minority of cases(10%) where pheochromocytoma is malignant, prognosisdepends on how far the cancer has spread, and thepatient’s age and general health. The overall median five-year survival from the initial time of surgery and diagno-sis is approximately 43%.\\nPrevention\\nUnfortunately, little is known about environmental\\nand other causes of pheochromocytoma. Some of thetumors are due to inherited predisposition. Because ofthese factors, pheochromocytoma can not be prevented.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nGoldfien, Alan. “Adrenal Medulla.” In Basic and Clinical\\nEndocrinology , ed.

CGC\\nPhlebitis seeThrombophlebitis\\nPhlebotomy\\nDefinition\\nPhlebotomy is the act of drawing or removing blood\\nfrom the circulatory system through a cut (incision) orpuncture in order to obtain a sample for analysis and diag-nosis. Phlebotomy is also done as part of the patient’streatment for certain blood disorders.\\nPurpose\\nTreatment\\nPhlebotomy that is part of treatment (therapeutic\\nphlebotomy) is performed to treat polycythemia vera ,a\\ncondition that causes an elevated red blood cell volume(hematocrit ). Phlebotomy is also prescribed for patients\\nwith disorders that increase the amount of iron in theirblood to dangerous levels, such as hemochromatosis ,\\nhepatitis B , and hepatitis C . Patients with pulmonary\\nedema may undergo phlebotomy procedures to decrease\\ntheir total blood volume.\\nDiagnosis\\nPhlebotomy is also used to remove blood from the\\nbody during blood donation and for analysis of the sub-stances contained within it.Precautions\\nPatients who are anemic or have a history of cardiovas-\\ncular disease may not be good candidates for phlebotomy.\\nDescription\\nPhlebotomy, which is also known as venesection, is\\nperformed by a nurse or a technician known as a phle-botomist. Blood is usually taken from a vein on the backof the hand or inside of the elbow. Some blood tests,however, may require blood from an artery. The skin overthe area is wiped with an antiseptic, and an elastic bandis tied around the arm. The band acts as a tourniquet,slowing the blood flow in the arm and making the veinsmore visible. The patient is asked to make a fist, and thetechnician feels the veins in order to select an appropriateone. When a vein is selected, the technician inserts a nee-dle into the vein and releases the elastic band. The appro-priate amount of blood is drawn and the needle is with-drawn from the vein. The patient’s pulse and blood pres-sure may be monitored during the procedure.\\nFor some tests requiring very small amounts of\\nblood for analysis, the technician uses a finger stick. Alance, or small needle, makes a small cut in the surface ofthe fingertip, and a small amount of blood is collected ina narrow glass tube. The fingertip may be squeezed to getadditional blood to surface.\\nThe amount of blood drawn depends on the purpose of\\nthe phlebotomy. Blood donors usually contribute a unit ofblood (500 mL) in a session. The volume of blood neededfor laboratory analysis varies widely with the type of testbeing conducted. Therapeutic phlebotomy removes a largeramount of blood than donation and blood analysis require.Phlebotomy for treatment of hemochromatosis typicallyinvolves removing a unit of blood—or 250 mg of iron—once a week. Phlebotomy sessions are required until ironlevels return to a consistently normal level, which may takeseveral months to several years. Phlebotomy for poly-cythemia vera removes enough blood to keep the patient’shematocrit below 45%. The frequency and duration of ses-sions depends on the patient’s individual needs.\\nPreparation\\nPatients having their blood drawn for analysis may\\nbe asked to discontinue medications or to avoid food (tofast) for a period of time before the blood test. Patientsdonating blood will be asked for a brief medical history,have their blood pressure taken, and have their hemat-ocrit checked with a finger stick test prior to donation.\\nAftercare\\nAfter blood is drawn and the needle is removed,\\npressure is placed on the puncture site with a cotton ball\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2580Phlebotomy'),\n",

It is not\\nuncommon for a patient to feel dizzy or nauseated duringor after phlebotomy. The patient may be encouraged torest for a short period once the procedure is completed.Patients are also instructed to drink plenty of fluids andeat regularly over the next 24 hours to replace lost bloodvolume. Patients who experience swelling of the punc-ture site or continued bleeding after phlebotomy shouldget medical help at once.\\nRisks\\nMost patients will have a small bruise or mild sore-\\nness at the puncture site for several days.

Theyaren’t “crazy”—they know full well their fears are unrea-sonable—but they can not control the fear. These peoplehave phobias.\\nPhobias belong to a large group of mental problems\\nknown as “anxiety disorders” that include obsessive-\\ncompulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder , and post-\\ntraumatic stress disorder . Phobias themselves can be\\ndivided into three specific types:\\n• specific phobias (formerly called “simple phobias”)• social phobia•agoraphobia\\nSpecific phobias\\nAs its name suggests, a specific phobia is the fear of\\na particular situation or object, including anything fromairplane travel to dentists. Found in one out of every 10Americans, specific phobias seem to run in families andare roughly twice as likely to appear in women. If the per-son rarely encounters the feared object, the phobia doesnot cause much harm. However, if the feared object or sit-uation is common, it can seriously disrupt everyday life.Common examples of specific phobias, which can beginat any age, include fear of snakes, flying, dogs, escalators,elevators, high places, or open spaces.\\nSocial phobia\\nPeople with social phobia have deep fears of being\\nwatched or judged by others and being embarrassed inpublic. This may extend to a general fear of social situa-tions—or be more specific or “circumscribed,” such as afear of giving speeches or of performing (stage fright).More rarely, people with social phobia may have troubleusing a public restroom, eating in a restaurant, or signingtheir name in front of others.\\nSocial phobia is not the same as shyness.

On the other hand,people with social phobia may not be shy—they may feelperfectly comfortable with people except in specific situa-tions. Social phobias may be only mildly irritating, orthey may significantly interfere with daily life. It is notunusual for people with social phobia to turn down joboffers or avoid relationships because of their fears.\\nAgoraphobia\\nAgoraphobia is the intense fear of feeling trapped\\nand having a panic attack in a public place. It usuallybegins between ages 15 and 35, and affects three times asmany women as men—about 3% of the population.\\nAn episode of spontaneous panic is usually the initial\\ntrigger for the development of agoraphobia. After an ini-tial panic attack, the person becomes afraid of experienc-ing a second one. Patients literally “fear the fear,” andworry incessantly about when and where the next attackmay occur. As they begin to avoid the places or situationsin which the panic attack occurred, their fear generalizes.Eventually the person completely avoids public places. Insevere cases, people with agoraphobia can no longer leavetheir homes for fear of experiencing a panic attack.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nExperts don’t really know why phobias develop,\\nalthough research suggests the tendency to develop pho-bias may be a complex interaction between heredity andenvironment. Some hypersensitive people have uniquechemical reactions in the brain that cause them torespond much more strongly to stress . These people also\\nmay be especially sensitive to caffeine , which triggers\\ncertain brain chemical responses.\\nWhile experts believe the tendency to develop pho-\\nbias runs in families and may be hereditary, a specificstressful event usually triggers the development of a spe-cific phobia or agoraphobia. For example, someone pre-disposed to develop phobias who experiences severe tur-bulence during a flight might go on to develop a phobiaabout flying. What scientists don’t understand is whysome people who experience a frightening or stressfulevent develop a phobia and others do not.\\nSocial phobia typically appears in childhood or ado-\\nlescence, sometimes following an upsetting or humiliat-ing experience. Certain vulnerable children who have hadunpleasant social experiences (such as being rejected) orwho have poor social skills may develop social phobias.The condition also may be related to low self-esteem,unassertive personality, and feelings of inferiority.A person with agoraphobia may have a panic attack\\nat any time, for no apparent reason. While the attack maylast only a minute or so, the person remembers the feel-ings of panic so strongly that the possibility of anotherattack becomes terrifying. For this reason, people withagoraphobia avoid places where they might not be able toescape if a panic attack occurs. As the fear of an attackescalates, the person’s world narrows.\\nWhile the specific trigger may differ, the symptoms\\nof different phobias are remarkably similar: e.g., feelingsof terror and impending doom, rapid heartbeat andbreathing, sweaty palms, and other features of a panicattack. Patients may experience severe anxiety symptomsin anticipating a phobic trigger. For example, someonewho is afraid to fly may begin having episodes of pound-ing heart and sweating palms at the mere thought of get-ting on a plane in two weeks.\\nDiagnosis\\nA mental health professional can diagnose phobias\\nafter a detailed interview and discussion of both mentaland physical symptoms. Social phobia is often associatedwith other anxiety disorders , depression, or substance\\nabuse.\\nTreatment\\nPeople who have a specific phobia that is easy to\\navoid (such as snakes) and that doesn’t interfere withtheir lives may not need to get help. When phobias dointerfere with a person’s daily life, a combination of psy-chotherapy and medication can be quite effective. Whilemost health insurance covers some form of mental healthcare, most do not cover outpatient care completely, andmost have a yearly or lifetime maximum.\\nMedication can block the feelings of panic, and\\nwhen combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy , can\\nbe quite effective in reducing specific phobias and agora-phobia.\\nCognitive-behavioral therapy adds a cognitive ap-\\nproach to more traditional behavioral therapy. It teachespatients how to change their thoughts, behavior, and atti-tudes, while providing techniques to lessen anxiety, suchas deep breathing, muscle relaxation, and refocusing.\\nOne cognitive-behavioral therapy is “desensitiza-\\ntion” (also known as “exposure therapy”), in which peo-ple are gradually exposed to the frightening object orevent until they become used to it and their physicalsymptoms decrease. For example, someone who is afraidof snakes might first be shown a photo of a snake. Oncethe person can look at a photo without anxiety, he mightthen be shown a video of a snake. Each step is repeated\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2582Phobias'),\n",

Eventually, the person mightreach the point where he can actually touch a live snake.Three fourths of patients are significantly improved withthis type of treatment.\\nAnother more dramatic cognitive-behavioral\\napproach is called “flooding,” which exposes the personimmediately to the feared object or situation. The personremains in the situation until the anxiety lessens.\\nSeveral drugs are used to treat specific phobias by\\ncontrolling symptoms and helping to prevent panicattacks. These include anti-anxiety drugs ( benzodi-\\nazepines ) such as alprazolam (Xanax) or diazepam (Val-\\nium). Blood pressure medications called “beta blockers,”such as propranolol (Inderal) and atenolol (Tenormin),appear to work well in the treatment of circumscribedsocial phobia, when anxiety gets in the way of perfor-mance, such as public speaking. These drugs reduceoverstimulation, thereby controlling the physical symp-toms of anxiety.\\nIn addition, some antidepressants may be effective\\nwhen used together with cognitive-behavioral therapy.These include the monoamine oxidase inhibitors\\n(MAO inhibitors) phenelzine (Nardil) and tranyl-cypromine (Parnate), as well as selective serotonin\\nreuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like fluoxetine (Prozac),\\nparoxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft) and fluvoxamine(Luvox).\\nIn all types of phobias, symptoms may be eased by\\nlifestyle changes, such as:\\n• eliminating caffeine• cutting down on alcohol• eating a good diet• getting plenty of exercise\\n• reducing stress\\nTreating agoraphobia is more difficult than other\\nphobias because there are often so many fears involved,such as open spaces, traffic, elevators, and escalators.Treatment includes cognitive-behavioral therapy withantidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs. Paxil and Zoloft areused to treat panic disorders with or without agoraphobia.\\nPrognosis\\nPhobias are among the most treatable mental health\\nproblems; depending on the severity of the condition andthe type of phobia, most properly treated patients can goon to lead normal lives. Research suggests that once aperson overcomes the phobia, the problem may notreturn for many years—if at all.Untreated phobias are another matter. Only about\\n20% of specific phobias will go away without treatment,and agoraphobia will get worse with time if untreated.Social phobias tend to be chronic, and will not likely goaway without treatment. Moreover, untreated phobias canlead to other problems, including depression, alcoholism ,\\nand feelings of shame and low self-esteem.\\nWhile most specific phobias appear in childhood and\\nsubsequently fade away, those that remain in adulthoodoften need to be treated. Unfortunately, most people neverget the help they need; only about 25% of people withphobias ever seek help to deal with their condition.\\nPrevention\\nThere is no known way to prevent the development\\nof phobias. Medication and cognitive-behavioral therapymay help prevent the recurrence of symptoms once theyhave been diagnosed.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAshley, Joyce.

Turkington\\nPhospholipidosis seePulmonary alveolar\\nproteinosis\\nPhosphorus imbalance\\nDefinition\\nPhosphorus imbalance refers to conditions in which\\nthe element phosphorus is present in the body at too higha level (hyperphosphatemia) or too low a level (hypo-phosphatemia).\\nDescription\\nAlmost all of the phosphorus in the body occurs as\\nphosphate (phosphorus combined with four oxygenatoms), and most of the body’s phosphate (85%) is locat-ed in the skeletal system, where it combines with calci-um to give bones their hardness. The remaining amount(15%) exists in the cells of the body, where it plays animportant role in the formation of key nucleic acids, suchas DNA, and in the process by which the body turns foodinto energy (metabolism). The body regulates phosphatelevels in the blood through the controlled release ofparathyroid hormone (PTH) from the parathyroid glandand calcitonin from the thyroid gland. PTH keeps phos-phate levels from becoming too high by stimulating theexcretion of phosphate in urine and causing the release ofcalcium from bones (phosphate blood levels are inverse-ly proportional to calcium blood levels). Calcitoninkeeps phosphate blood levels in check by moving phos-phates out of the blood and into the bone matrix to forma mineral salt with calcium.\\nMost phosphorus imbalances develop gradually and\\nare the result of other conditions or disorders, such asmalnutrition , poor kidney function, or a malfunctioning\\ngland.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2584Phosphorus imbalance'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 291}, page_content='Causes and symptoms\\nHypophosphatemia\\nHypophosphatemia (low blood phosphate) has vari-\\nous causes. Hyperparathyroidism , a condition in which\\nthe parathyroid gland produces too much PTH, is one pri-mary cause. Poor kidney function, in which the renaltubules do not adequately reabsorb phosphorus, can resultin hypophosphatemia, as can overuse of diuretics , such as\\ntheophylline, and antacids containing aluminum hydrox-\\nide. Problems involving the intestinal absorption of phos-phate, such as chronic diarrhea or a deficiency of vitamin\\nD (needed by the intestines to properly absorb phosphates)can cause the condition. Malnutrition due to chronic alco-\\nholism can result in an inadequate intake of phosphorus.\\nRecovery from conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis\\nor severe burns can provoke hypophosphatemia, since the\\nbody must use larger-than-normal amounts of phosphate.Respiratory alkylosis, brought on by hyperventilation, canalso result in temporary hypophosphatemia.\\nSymptoms generally occur only when phosphate\\nlevels have decreased profoundly. They include muscleweakness, tingling sensations, tremors , and bone weak-\\nness. Hypophosphatemia may also result in confusionand memory loss, seizures, and coma.\\nHyperphosphatemia\\nHyperphosphatemia (high blood phosphate) also has\\nvarious causes. It is most often caused by a decline in thenormal excretion of phosphate in urine as a result of kid-ney failure or impaired function. Hypoparathyroidism ,\\na condition in which the parathyroid gland does not pro-duce enough PTH, or pseudoparathyroidism, a conditionin which the kidneys lose their ability to respond to PTH,can also contribute to decreased phosphate excretion.Hyperphosphatemia can also result from the overuse oflaxatives or enemas that contain phosphate. Hypocal-\\ncemia (abnormally low blood calcium) can cause phos-\\nphate blood levels to increase abnormally. A side-effectof hyperphosphatemia is the formation of calcium-phos-phate crystals in the blood and soft tissue.\\nHyperphosphatemia is generally asymptomatic; how-\\never, it can occur in conjunction with hypocalcemia, thesymptoms of which are numbness and tingling in the\\nextemities, muscle cramps and spasms, depression, memo-ry loss, and convulsions. When calcium-phosphate crystalsbuild up in the blood vessels, they can cause arteriosclero-sis, which can lead to heart attacks or strokes. When thecrystals build up in the skin, they can cause severe itching .\\nDiagnosis\\nDisorders of phosphate metabolism are assessed by\\nmeasuring serum or plasma levels of phosphate and calci-um. Hypophosphatemia is diagnosed if the blood phos-\\nphate level is less than 2.5 milligrams per deciliter of blood.Hyperphosphatemia is diagnosed if the blood phosphatelevel is above 4.5 milligrams per deciliter of blood. Appro-priate tests are also used to determine if the underlyingcause of the imbalance, including assessments of kidneyfunction, dietary intake, and appropriate hormone levels.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of phosphorus imbalances focuses on cor-\\nrecting the underlying cause of the imbalance and restor-ing equilibrium. Treating the underlying condition mayinvolve surgical removal of the parathyroid gland in thecase of hypophosphatemia caused by hyperparathy-roidism; initiating hormone therapy in cases of hyper-phosphatemia caused by hypoparathyroidism; ceasingintake of drugs or medications that contribute to phos-phorus imbalance; or instigating measures to restoreproper kidney function.\\nRestoring phosphorus equilibrium in cases of mild\\nhypophosphatemia may include drinking a prescribedsolution that is rich in phosphorus; however, since thissolution can cause diarrhea, many doctors recommendthat patients drink 1 qt (0.9 L) of skim milk per dayinstead, since milk and other diary products are signifi-cant sources of phosphate. Other phosphate-rich foodsinclude green, leafy vegetables; peas and beans; nuts;chocolate; beef liver; turkey; and some cola drinks.Severe hypophosphatemia may be treated with the admin-istration of an intravenous solution containing phosphate.\\nRestoring phosphorus equilibrium in cases of mild\\nhyperphosphatemia involves restricting intake of phos-phorus-rich foods and taking a calcium-based antacidthat binds to the phosphate and blocks its absorption inthe intestines. In cases of severe hyperphosphatemia, anintravenous infusion of calcium gluconate may beadministered. Dialysis may also be required in severecases to help remove excess phosphate from the blood.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for treating hyperphosphatemia and\\nhypophosphatemia are excellent, though in cases wherethese problems are due to genetic disease, life-long hor-mone treatment may be necessary.\\nPrevention\\nPhosphorus imbalances caused by hormonal disor-\\nders or other genetically determined conditions cannot beprevented.

The\\ncornea is the clear outer structure of the eye that lies infront of the colored part of the eye (iris). PRK andLASIK are two forms of vision-correcting (refractive)surgery. The two techniques differ in how the surfacelayer of the cornea is treated. As of mid 1998, two eximerlasers (Summit and Visx) had been approved for laservision correction (refractive surgery using a laser) in thePRK procedure. Since then, Visx, Summit, and otherlasers have received approval by the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) for use in LASIK procedures.\\nPurpose\\nThe purpose of both LASIK and PRK is to correct\\nnearsightedness in persons who don’t want to, or can’t,wear eye glasses or contact lenses. Most patients are able tosee well enough to pass a driver’s license exam withoutglasses or contact lenses after the operation. After approxi-mately age 40, the lens in the eye stiffens making it harderto focus up close. Because laser vision correction onlyaffects the cornea, the procedures do not eliminate the needfor reading glasses. Patients should be wary of any ads that“guarantee” 20/20 vision. Patients should also make surethat the laser being used is approved by the FDA.\\nPrecautions\\nPatients should be over 18 years of age, have healthy\\ncorneas, and have vision that has been stable for the pastyear. People who may not be good candidates for theseprocedures are pregnant women or women who arebreastfeeding (vision may not be stable); people withscarred corneas or macular disease; people with autoim-mune diseases (i.e., systemic lupus erythematosus or\\nrheumatoid arthritis ); or people with diabetes. Patients\\nwith glaucoma should not have LASIK because the\\nintraocular pressure (IOP) of the eye is raised during theprocedure. A patient with persistent lid infections (i.e.,blepharitis) may not be a good candidate because of anincreased risk of infection. An ophthalmologist who spe-cializes in laser vision correction can determine whowould be likely to benefit from the operation and suggestwhich of the two operations might be more appropriatefor any given patient.\\nIf a patient is thinking of having cataract surgery ,\\nthey should discuss it with the doctor. During cataractsurgery an intracocular lens (IOL) will be inserted andthat alone may correct distance vision.\\nDescription\\nPRK and LASIK are both performed with an excimer\\nlaser, which uses a cold beam of ultraviolet light to sculptor reshape the cornea so that light will focus properly onthe retina. The cornea is the major focusing structure ofthe eye. The retina sends the image focused on it to thebrain. In myopia, the cornea is either too steep or the eyeis too long for a clear image to be focused on the retina.PRK and LASIK flatten out the cornea so that the imagewill focus more precisely on the retina.\\nIn PRK, the surface of the cornea is removed by the\\nlaser. In LASIK, the outer layer of the cornea is sliced,lifted, moved aside while the cornea is reshaped with thelaser, then replaced to speed healing. Both procedurescause the cornea to become flatter, which corrects thenearsighted vision.\\nAt least one laser has been approved to treat mild\\nastigmatism as of 2000. Correcting farsightedness\\n(hyperopia ) may be possible in the future.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2586Photorefractive keratectomy and laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 293}, page_content='These laser vision-correcting procedures are rapidly\\nreplacing radial keratotomy (RK), an earlier form of\\nrefractive surgery that involved cutting the cornea with ascalpel in a pattern of radiating spokes. RK has declinedin popularity since the approval of the excimer laser in1995, falling from a high of 250,000 procedures per-formed per year in 1994 to 50,000 in 1997.\\nFor both LASIK and PRK, the patient’s eye is\\nnumbed with anesthetic drops. No injections are neces-sary. The patient is awake and relaxed during the pro-cedure.\\nLASIK is sometimes referred to as a “flap and zap”\\nprocedure because a thin flap of tissue is temporarilyremoved from the surface of the cornea and the under-lying cornea is then “zapped” with a laser. Prior to thesurgery, the surface of the cornea is marked with a dyemarker so that the flap of cornea can be preciselyaligned when it is replaced. The doctor places a suctionring on the eye to hold it steady. During this part of theoperation, which lasts only a few seconds, the patient isnot able to see. A surgical instrument called a microker-atome is passed over the cornea to create a very thinflap of tissue. The IOP is increased at this time which iswhy it is contraindicated in patients with glaucoma.This thin tissue layer is folded back. The cornea isreshaped with the laser beam and the cell layer isreplaced. Because the cell layer is not permanentlyremoved, patients have a faster recovery time and expe-rience far less discomfort than with PRK. An antibioticdrop is put in and the eye is patched until the followingday’s checkup.\\nIn PRK, a small area of the surface layer of the\\ncornea is vaporized. It takes about three days for the sur-face cells to grow back and vision will be blurred. Somepatients describe it as “looking through Vaseline.” PRKis generally recommended for patient’s with mild tomoderate myopia (usually under -5.00 diopters).\\nWith both PRK and LASIK, there is a loud tapping\\nsound from the laser and a burning smell as the cornea isreshaped. The surgery itself is painless and takes only aminute or two. Patients are usually able to return homeimmediately after surgery. Most patients wait (up to sixmonths) before they have the second one done. Thisallows the first eye to heal and to see if there were com-plications from the surgery.\\nThe cost of these procedures can vary with geo-\\ngraphic area and the doctor. In general, the procedurecosts $1,350–$2,500 per eye for PRK and about $500more per eye for LASIK. PRK and LASIK are generallynot covered by insurance. However, insurance may coverthese procedures for people in certain occupations, suchas police officers and firefighters.Preparation\\nIf a patient wears contact lenses, they should not be\\nworn for a few weeks prior to surgery. It also is importantto discontinue contact lens wear prior to the visual examsto make sure vision is stable. The doctor should beadvised of contact lens wear.\\nUpon arrival at the doctor’s office on the day of\\nsurgery, patients are given some eye drops and a sedative,such as Valium, to relax them. Their vision is tested.They rest while waiting for the sedative to take effect.Immediately before the surgery, patients are given localanesthetic eye drops.\\nAftercare\\nAfter surgery, antibiotic drops are placed in the eye\\nand the eye may be patched. The patient returns for a fol-low-up visit the next day. The patient is usually given aprescription for eyedrops (usually antibiotic and anti-inflammatory). Patients who have had PRK usually feelmild discomfort for one to three days after the procedure.They may need a bandage contact lens. Patients whohave had LASIK generally have less, or even no discom-fort after the surgery. After LASIK, antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drops are generally necessary for oneweek. After PRK, steroidal eye drops may be necessaryfor months. Because steroids may increase the possibilityof glaucoma or cataracts , it is a big drawback to the pro-\\ncedure. The patient should speak with the doctor to seehow long follow-up medications will be necessary.\\nMost patients return to work within one to three\\ndays after the procedure, although visual recovery fromPRK may take as long as four weeks. An eye shield maybe used for about one week at night and patients may besensitive to bright light for a few days. Patients may beasked by their doctor to keep water out of their eye for aweek and to avoid mascara or eyeliner during this period.\\nRisks\\nThere is a risk of under- or over-correction with either\\nof these procedures. If vision is under-corrected, a secondprocedure can be performed to achieve results that may becloser to 20/20 vision. About 5–10% of PRK patientsreturn for an adjustment, as do 10–25% of LASIKpatients. People with higher degrees of myopia havevision that is harder to correct and usually have LASIKsurgery rather than PRK. This may account for the higherincidence of adjustments for LASIK patients. Patientswith very high myopia (over -15.00 diopters) may experi-ence improvement after LASIK, but they are not likely toachieve 20/40 vision without glasses. However, theirglasses will not need to be as thick or heavy after the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2587Photorefractive keratectomy and laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis'),\n",

However, most patients, especially those with less\\nextreme myopia, do not need glasses after the surgery.\\nHaze is another possible side effect. Although hazy\\nvision is unlikely, it is more likely to occur after PRKthan after LASIK. This haze usually clears up. Cornealscarring, halos, or glare at night, or an irritating bump onthe cornea are other possible side effects. As with anyeye surgery, infection is possible, but rare. Loss of visionis possible with these procedures, but this complicationis extremely rare.\\nMost complications from LASIK are related to the\\ncreation and realignment of the flap. The microkeratomemust be in good-working order and sharp. LASIK requiresa great deal of skill on the part of the surgeon and the com-plication rate is related to the experience level of the sur-geon. In one study, the rate of LASIK complicationsdeclined from 3% for surgeons during their first threemonths using this technique, to 1% after a year’s experi-ence in the technique, to 0% after 18 months experience.\\nNormal results\\nMost patients experience improvement in their\\nvision immediately after the operation and about half ofLASIK patients are able to see 20/30 within one day ofthe surgery. Vision tends to become sharper over the nextfew days and then stabilizes; however, it is possible tohave shifts in myopia for the next few months.

Murray, PhD\\nPhotosensitivity\\nDefinition\\nPhotosensitivity is any increase in the reactivity of\\nthe skin to sunlight.\\nDescription\\nThe skin is a carefully designed interface between\\nour bodies and the outside world. It is infection-proofwhen intact, nearly waterproof, and filled with protectivemechanisms. Sunlight threatens the health of the skin.Normal skin is highly variable in its ability to resist sundamage. Natural skin pigmentation is its main protection.The term photosensitivity refers to any increase beyondwhat is considered normal variation.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are over three dozen diseases, two dozen\\ndrugs, and several perfume and cosmetic componentsthat can cause photosensitivity. There are also severaldifferent types of reaction to sunlight—phototoxicity,photoallergy, and polymorphous light eruption. In addi-tion, prolonged exposure to sunlight, even in normalskin, leads to skin aging and cancer . These effects are\\naccelerated in patients who have photosensitivity.Phototoxicity is a severely exaggerated reaction to\\nsunlight caused by a new chemical in the skin. The pri-mary symptom is sunburn , which is rapid and can be\\nsevere enough to blister (a second degree burn). Thechemicals associated with phototoxicity are usuallydrugs. The list includes several common antibiotics—quinolones, sulfonamides , and tetracyclines ; diuret-\\nics(water pills); major tranquilizers; oral diabetes\\nmedication; and cancer medicines. There are also somedermatologic drugs, both topical and oral, that can sen-sitize skin.\\nPhotoallergy produces an intense itching rash on\\nexposure to sunlight. Patients develop chronic skinchanges (lichen simplex) as a result of scratching. Someof the agents that cause phototoxicity can also cause pho-toallergy. Some cosmetic and perfume ingredients,including one of the most common sunscreens—para-amino benzoic acid (PABA)—can do this.\\nPolymorphous light eruption resembles photoallergy\\nin its production of intensely itching rashes in sunlight.\\nHowever, this condition lessens with continued lightexposure, and so is seen mostly in the spring. Also, theredoes not seem to be an identifiable chemical involved.\\nDiseases of several kinds increase skin sensitivity.\\n• A hereditary disease called xeroderma pigmentosum\\nincludes a defect in repair mechanisms that greatlyaccelerates skin damage from sunlight.\\n• A family of metabolic diseases called porphyrias pro-\\nduce chemicals (porphyrins) that absorb sunlight in theskin and thereby cause damage.\\n• Albinos lack skin pigment through a genetic defect and\\nare thus very sensitive to light.\\n• Malnutrition, specifically a deficiency of niacin known\\nas pellagra , sensitizes the skin.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2589Photosensitivity\\nA skin rash on the front of a woman’s neck caused by a\\nphotosensitive reaction to sunlight.

A skin biopsy may be\\nneeded for further clarification.\\nTreatment\\nRemoval of the offending drug or chemical is prima-\\nry. Direct sunlight exposure should be limited.

Ricker Polsdorfer, MD\\nPhototherapy\\nDefinition\\nPhototherapy, or light therapy, is the administration\\nof doses of bright light in order to normalize the body’sinternal clock and/or relieve depression.\\nPurpose\\nPhototherapy is prescribed primarily to treat season-\\nal affective disorder (SAD), a mood disorder character-\\nized by depression in the winter months, and is occasion-ally employed to treat insomnia and jet lag . The exact\\nmechanisms by which the treatment works are not known,but the bright light employed in phototherapy may act toreadjust the body’s circadian (daily) rhythms, or internalclock. Other popular theories are that light triggers theproduction of serotonin, a neurotransmitter believed to berelated to depressive disorders , or that it influences the\\nbody’s production of melatonin, a hormone derived fromserotonin that may be related to circadian rhythms.\\nPrecautions\\nPatients with eye problems should see an ophthal-\\nmologist regularly, both before and during phototherapy.Because some ultraviolet rays are emitted by the lightboxes used in phototherapy, patients taking photosensi-tizing medications (medications making the skin moresensitive to light) and those who have sun-sensitive skinshould consult with their physician before beginningtreatment. Patients with medical conditions that makethem sensitive to ultraviolet rays should also be seen by aphysician before starting phototherapy. Patients whohave a history of mood swings or mania should be moni-\\ntored closely, since phototherapy may cause excessivemood elevation in some individuals.\\nDescription\\nPhototherapy is generally administered at home. The\\nmost commonly used phototherapy equipment is aportable lighting device known as a light box. The boxmay be mounted upright to a wall, or slanted downwardstowards a table. The patient sits in front of the box for aprescribed period of time (anywhere from 15 minutes toseveral hours). Some patients with SAD undergo pho-totherapy sessions two or three times a day, others only\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2590Phototherapy\\nThis person had a phototoxic reaction after taking an antibi-\\notic drug.

The time of day and number of times treatment is\\nadministered depend on the physical needs and lifestyleof the individual patient. If phototherapy has been pre-scribed for the treatment of SAD, it typically begins inthe fall months as the days begin to shorten, and contin-ues throughout the winter and possibly the early spring.\\nThe light from a slanted light box is designed to\\nfocus on the table it sits upon, so patients may look downto read or do other sedentary activities during therapy.Patients using an upright light box must face the lightsource (although they need not look directly into thelight). The light sources in these light boxes typicallyrange from 2,500–10,000 lux. (In contrast, averageindoor lighting is 300–500 lux; a sunny summer day isabout 100,000 lux).\\nPhototherapy prescribed for the treatment of SAD may\\nbe covered by insurance. Individuals requiring phototherapyshould check with their insurance company to see if the costof renting or purchasing a light box is covered.\\nAftercare\\nPatients beginning light therapy for SAD may need\\nto adjust the length, frequency, and timing of their pho-totherapy sessions to achieve the maximum benefit.These patients should keep their doctor informed of theirprogress and the status of their depressive symptoms.Occasionally, antidepressants and/or psychotherapy maybe recommended as an adjunct to phototherapy.\\nRisks\\nAn abnormally elevated or expansive mood (hypo-\\nmania) may occur, but it is usually temporary. Somepatients undergoing phototherapy treatment report sideeffects of eyestrain, headaches, insomnia, fatigue ,sun-\\nburn , and dry eyes or nose. Most of these effects can be\\nmanaged by adjusting the timing and duration of the pho-totherapy sessions. A strong sun block and eye and nosedrops can alleviate the other problems. Long-term stud-ies have shown no negative effects to the eye function ofindividuals undergoing phototherapy treatments.\\nNormal results\\nPatients with SAD typically report an alleviation of\\ndepressive symptoms within two to 14 days after begin-ning phototherapy.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

Occasionally, itgoes awry and attacks harmless or mildly noxiousagents, doing more harm than good. This event is termedallergy if the target is from the outside—like pollen orbee venom—and autoimmunity if it is caused by one ofthe body’s own components.\\nThe immune system usually responds only to certain\\nkinds of chemicals, namely proteins. However, non-pro-teins can trigger the same sort of response, probably byaltering a protein to make it look like a target. Physicalallergy refers to reactions in which a protein is not theinitial inciting agent.\\nSometimes it takes a combination of elements to\\nproduce an allergic reaction. A classic example is drugsthat are capable of sensitizing the skin to sunlight. Theresult is phototoxicity, which appears as an increasedsensitivity to sunlight or as localized skin rashes on sun-\\nexposed areas.\\nCauses and symptoms\\n• Minor injury, such as scratching, causes itchy welts to\\ndevelop in about 5% of people. The presence of itchywelts (urticaria) is a condition is called dermographism.\\n• Cold can change certain proteins in the blood so that they\\ninduce an immune reaction. This may indicate that thereare abnormal proteins in the blood from a disease of thebone marrow. The reaction may also involve the lungsand circulation, producing wheezing and fainting .\\n• Heat allergies can be caused by exercise or even strong\\nemotions in sensitive people.\\n• Sunlight, even without drugs, causes immediate\\nurticaria in some people. This may be a symptom ofporphyria—a genetic metabolic defect.\\n• Elements like nickel and chromium, although not pro-\\nteins, commonly cause skin rashes, and iodine allergycauses skin rashes and sores in the mouth in allergicindividuals.\\n• Pressure or vibration can also cause urticaria.• Water contact can cause aquagenic urticaria, presum-\\nably due to chlorine or some other trace chemical in thewater, although distilled water has been known to causethis reaction.\\nWhen the inflammatory reaction involves deeper\\nlayers of the skin, urticaria becomes angioedema. Theskin, especially the lips and eyelids, swells. The tongue,throat, and parts of the digestive tract may also beinvolved. Angioedema may be due to physical agents.Often the cause remains unknown.KEY TERMS\\nAntihistamine —Drugs that block histamine, a\\nmajor cause of itching.\\nHemolysis —Destruction of red blood cells.\\nInflammation —Heat, redness, swelling, and pain\\ncaused by an immune response.\\nDiagnosis\\nVisual examination of the symptoms usually diag-\\nnoses the reaction.

A complete health assess-ment also includes gathering information about a per-son’s medical history and lifestyle, doing laboratorytests, and screening for disease.\\nPurpose\\nThe annual physical examination has been replaced\\nby the periodic health examination. How often this isdone depends on the patient’s age, sex, and risk factorsfor disease. The United States Preventative Services TaskForce (USPSTF) has developed guidelines for preventa-tive health examinations that health care professionalswidely follow. Organizations that promote detection andprevention of specific diseases, like the American CancerSociety, generally recommend more intensive or frequentexaminations.\\nA comprehensive physical examination provides an\\nopportunity for the health care professional to obtainbaseline information about the patient for future use, andto establish a relationship before problems happen. Itprovides an opportunity to answer questions and teachgood health practices. Detecting a problem in its earlystages can have good long-term results.\\nPrecautions\\nThe patient should be comfortable and treated with\\nrespect throughout the examination. As the examinationprocedes, the examiner should explain what he or she isdoing and share any relevant findings.\\nDescription\\nA complete physical examination usually starts at\\nthe head and proceeds all the way to the toes. However,the exact procedure will vary according to the needs ofthe patient and the preferences of the examiner. An aver-age examination takes about 30 minutes. The cost of theexamination will depend on the charge for the profes-sional’s time and any tests that are done. Most healthplans cover routine physical examinations includingsome tests.\\nThe examination\\nFirst, the examiner will observe the patient’s appear-\\nance, general health, and behavior, along with measuringheight and weight.

The exposed areas of the skin are observed; the\\nsize and shape of any lesions are noted.\\n• Head. The hair, scalp, skull, and face are examined.\\n• Eyes. The external structures are observed. The internal\\nstructures can be observed using an ophthalmoscope (alighted instrument) in a darkened room.\\n• Ears. The external structures are inspected. A lighted\\ninstrument called an otoscope may be used to inspectinternal structures.\\n• Nose and sinuses. The external nose is examined.

Pica has beenobserved in ethnic groups worldwide, in both primitiveand modernized cultures, in both sexes, and in all agegroups. The word pica comes from the Latin name formagpie, a bird known for its unusual and indiscriminateeating habits. In addition to humans, pica has beenobserved in other animals, including the chimpanzee.Pica in humans has many different subgroups,\\ndefined by the substance that is ingested. Some of themost commonly described types of pica are eating earth,soil or clay (geophagia), ice (pagophagia) and starch(amylophagia). However, pica involving dozens of othersubstances, including cigarette butts and ashes, hair,paint chips, and paper have also been reported.\\nAlthough pica can occur in individuals of any back-\\nground, a higher incidence of pica is associated with:\\n•pregnancy\\n• developmental delay and mental retardation\\n• psychiatric disease and autism\\n• early childhood\\n• poor nutrition or low blood levels of iron and other\\nminerals\\n• certain cultural or religious traditions\\nCauses and symptoms\\nEvidence suggests that there may be several causes\\nof pica. One widely held theory points to iron deficiencyas a major cause of pica. Several reports have describedpica in individuals with documented iron deficiency,although there has been uncertainty as to whether theiron deficiency was a cause of pica or a result of it.Because some substances, such as clay, are believed toblock the absorption of iron into the bloodstream, it wasthought that low blood levels of iron could be the directresult of pica. However, some studies have shown thatpica cravings in individuals with iron deficiency stoponce iron supplements are given to correct the deficiency.Another study looked specifically at the rate of ironabsorption during pica conditions and normal dietarybehavior, and showed that the iron absorption was notdecreased by pica. In addition, low blood levels of ironcommonly occur in pregnant women and those with poornutrition, two populations at higher risk for pica. Suchfindings offer strong support of iron deficiency as acause, rather than result, of pica.\\nOther reports suggest that pica may have a psycho-\\nlogical basis and may even fall into the spectrum ofobsessive-compulsive disorder . Pica has a higher inci-\\ndence in populations with an underlying diagnosisinvolving mental functioning. These diagnoses includepsychiatric conditions like schizophrenia , developmen-\\ntal disorders including autism, and conditions with men-tal retardation. These conditions are not characterized byiron deficiency, which supports a psychological compo-nent in the cause of pica.\\nCultural and religious traditions may also play a role\\nin pica behavior. In some cultures, non-food substances\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2595Pica'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 302}, page_content='are believed to have positive health or spiritual effects.\\nAmong some African Americans in the south, ingesting aparticular kind of white clay is believed to promote healthand reduce morning sickness during pregnancy. Othercultures practice pica out of belief that eating a particularsubstance may promote fertility or bring good luck.\\nThe hallmark feature of pica, consistently consum-\\ning non-food substances, often does not present publicly.People may be embarrassed to admit to these unusualeating habits, and may hide it from their family andphysician. In other cases, an individual may not reportthe pica to a physician simply because of a lack ofknowledge of pica’s potential medical significance.\\nBecause the eating behaviors of pica are not usually\\ndetected or reported, it is the complications of the behav-ior that bring it to attention. Complications vary, depend-ing on the type of pica. Geophagia has potential sideeffects that most commonly affect the intestine andbowel. Complications can include constipation , cramp-\\ning, pain , obstruction caused by formation of an indi-\\ngestible mass, perforation from sharp objects like rocksor gravel, and contamination and infection from soil-dwelling parasites.\\nAmylophagia usually involves the consumption of\\ncornstarch and, less frequently, laundry starch. The highcaloric content of starch can cause excessive weight gain,while at the same time leading to malnutrition , as starch\\ncontributes “empty” calories lacking vitamins and min-\\nerals. Amylophagia during pregnancy can mimic gesta-\\ntional diabetes in its presentation and even in its poten-\\ntial harmful effects on the fetus.\\nPica involving the ingestion of substances such as\\nlead-based paint or paper containing mercury can causesymptoms of toxic poisoning . Compulsive consumption\\nof even a seemingly harmless substance like ice(pagophagia) can have negative side effects, includingdecreased absorption of nutrients by the gut.\\nDiagnosis\\nIn order for the diagnosis of pica to be made, there\\nmust be a history of persistent consumption of a non-food substance continuing for a minimum period of onemonth. Infants and toddlers are typically excluded fromthis diagnosis since mouthing objects is a normal devel-opmental behavior at that age. Individuals with mentalretardation who function at or below an approximatecognitive level of 18 months may also be exempt formthis diagnosis.\\nPica is most often diagnosed when a report of such\\nbehaviors can be provided by the patient or documentedby another individual. In other cases, pica is diagnosedafter studies have been performed to assess the present-\\ning symptoms. For example, imaging studies ordered toassess severe gastrointestinal complaints may revealintestinal blockage with an opaque substance; such afinding is suggestive of pica. Biopsy of intestinal con-tents can also reveal findings, such as parasitic infection,consistent with pica. Pica may also be suspected ifabnormal levels of certain minerals or chemicals aredetected in the blood.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of pica will often depend on the cause and\\ntype of pica. Conventional medical treatment may beappropriate in certain situations. For example, supple-mentation with iron-containing vitamins has been shownto cause the unusual cravings to subside in some iron-deficient patients.\\nMedical complications and health threats, including\\nhigh lead levels, bowel perforation or intestinal obstruc-tion, will require additional medical management,beyond addressing the underlying issue of pica.\\nAlternative treatment\\nBecause most cases of pica do not have an obvious\\nmedical cause, treatment with counseling, education, andnutritional management is often more successful andmore appropriate than treatment with medication. Sometherapists specializing in eating disorders may haveexpertise in treating pica.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for individuals with pica varies great-\\nly, according to the type and amount of substance ingest-ed, the extent of presenting side effects, and the successof treatment. Many of the side effects and complicationsof pica can be reversed once the behavior is stopped,while other complications, including infection and bowelperforation, pose significant health threats and if not suc-cessfully treated may result in death .\\nWhen seen in children, pica behavior tends to lessen\\nwith age. However, individuals with a history of pica aremore likely to experience it again. Counseling and nutri-tional education can reduce the risk of recurrence.\\nPrevention\\nThere are no known methods of preventing pica. How-\\never, once pica is known or suspected, measures can betaken to reduce further ingestion of non-food substances.Removing the particular substance from readily accessibleareas can be helpful. Close observation of the individualwith pica may limit inappropriate eating behaviors.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2596Pica'),\n",

The skin is cleaned, then the needle and jewelryare inserted through the tissue in one swift motion. Apiercing is done without anesthesia and is typically com-pleted in tattoo or beauty parlors.\\nOriginating from the Tahitian word tattau, meaning\\n“to mark,” tattoos are relatively permanent marks ordesigns on the skin.

Theexercises can also be adapted for people who have limit-ed movement or who use wheel chairs. It is an engagingexercise program that people want to do. Pilates pro-\\nmotes a feeling of physical and mental well-being andalso develops inner physical awareness. Since thismethod strengthens and lengthens the muscles withoutcreating bulk, it is particularly beneficial for dancers andactors. Pilates is also helpful in preventing and rehabili-tating from injuries, improving posture, and increasingflexibility, circulation, and balance. Pregnant womenwho do these exercises can develop body alignment,improve concentration, and develop body shape and toneafter pregnancy . According to Joseph Pilates, “You will\\nfeel better in 10 sessions, look better in 20 sessions andhave a completely new body in 30 sessions.”\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nJoseph Pilates, the founder of the Pilates method\\n(also simply referred to as “the method”) was born inGermany in 1880. As a frail child with rickets, asthma ,\\nand rheumatic fever , he was determined to becomestronger. He dedicated himself to building both his body\\nand his mind through practices which included yoga ,\\nzen, and ancient Roman and Greek exercises. His condi-tioning regime worked and he became an accomplishedgymnast, skier, boxer, and diver.\\nWhile interned in England during World War I for\\nbeing a German citizen, Pilates became a nurse. Duringthis time, he designed a unique system of hooking springsand straps to a hospital bed in order to help his disabledand immobilized patients regain strength and movement.It was through these experiments that he recognized theimportance of training the core abdominal and back mus-cles to stabilize the torso and allow the entire body tomove freely. This experimentation provided the founda-tion for his style of conditioning and the specialized exer-cise equipment associated with the Pilates method.\\nPilates emigrated to the United States in 1926 after\\nthe German government invited him to use his condition-ing methods to train the army. That same year he openedthe first Pilates studio in New York City. Over the years,dancers, actors, and athletes flocked to his studio to heal,condition, and align their bodies.\\nJoseph Pilates died at age 87 in a fire at his studio.\\nAlthough his strength enabled him to escape the flamesby hanging from the rafters for over an hour, he diedfrom smoke inhalation . He believed that ideal fitness is\\n“the attainment and maintenance of a uniformly devel-oped body with a sound mind fully capable of naturally,easily, and satisfactorily preforming our many and varieddaily tasks with spontaneous zest and pleasure.”\\nDuring the initial meeting, an instructor will analyze\\nthe client’s posture and movement and design a specifictraining program. Once the program has been created,the sessions usually follow a basic pattern. A sessiongenerally begins with mat work and passive and activestretching. In passive stretching, the instructor moves andpresses the client’s body to stretch and elongate the mus-cles. During the active stretching period, the client pre-forms the stretches while the instructor watches theirform and breathing. These exercises warm up the mus-cles in preparation for the machine work. The machineshelp the client to maintain the correct positioningrequired for each exercise.\\nThere are 500 exercises that were developed by\\nJoseph Pilates. “Classical” exercises, according to thePilates Studio in New York involve several principles.These include concentration, centering, flowing move-ment, and breath. Some instructors teach only the classi-cal exercises originally taught by Joseph Pilates. Othersdesign new exercises that are variations upon these clas-sical forms in order to make the exercises more accessi-ble for a specific person.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2600Pilates'),\n",

The Reformerresembles a single bed frame and is equipped with a car-riage that slides back and forth and adjustable springsthat are used to regulate tension and resistance. Cables,bars, straps, and pulleys allow the exercises to be donefrom a variety of positions. Instructors usually work withtheir clients on the machines for 20–45 minutes. Duringthis time, they are observing and giving feedback aboutalignment, breathing, and precision of movement. Theexercises are done slowly and carefully so that the move-ments are smooth and flowing. This requires focusedconcentration and muscle control. The session ends withlight stretching and a cool-down period.\\nOnce the basics are learned from an instructor, from\\neither one-on-one lessons or in a class, it is possible totrain at home using videos.

Dancersand actors originally embraced it as a form of strengthtraining that did not create muscle bulk. Professionaland amateur athletes also use these exercises to preventreinjury.

The cornea lies infront of the colored part of the eye (iris).

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 308}, page_content='Pingueculae are seen as small, raised, thickenings of\\nthe conjunctiva. They may be yellow, gray, white, or col-orless. They are almost always to one side of the iris—not above or below—and usually on the side closest tothe nose. A pinguecula may develop into a pterygium.\\nPterygia are conjunctival thickenings that may have\\nblood vessels associated with them. They often have atriangular-shaped appearance. The pterygia may alsogrow over the cornea and may therefore affect vision.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe cause or causes of these disorders are unknown,\\nbut they are more frequent in people who live in sunnyand windy climates and people whose jobs expose themto ultraviolet (UV) light (for example, farmers and arcwelders). Pingueculae and pterygia also occur in olderpeople. It is thought these growths are the result of UV orinfrared light and irritation. It is also believed that pro-longed exposure to these risk factors (that is, UV light)increases the chances of occurrence.\\nSymptoms\\nAlthough some people with pinguecula constantly\\nfeel like they have a foreign body in their eye, most areasymptomatic. Because the lids can no longer spread thetears over a smooth area, dry areas may result. Somepeople with a pterygium are also asymptomatic; somefeel like they have a foreign body in their eye. Because apterygium can stretch and distort the cornea, some peo-ple acquire astigmatism from a pterygium.\\nDiagnosis\\nAn eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) can\\nusually diagnose pingueculae and pterygia by externalobservation, generally using an instrument called a slit\\nlamp. A slit lamp is a microscope with a light source andmagnifies the structures of the eye for the examiner. How-ever, because pingueculae and pterygia can sometimes looksimilar to more serious eye growths, it is important for peo-ple to have them checked by an eye care professional.\\nTreatment\\nUsually, no treatment is needed. Artificial tears can\\nbe used to relieve the sensation of a foreign body in theeye and to protect against dryness. Surgery to removethe pinguecula or pterygium is advisable when the effecton the cornea causes visual defects or when the thicken-ing is causing excessive and recurrent discomfort orinflammation. Sometimes surgical removal is also per-formed for cosmetic reasons. However, healing fromthis type of surgery, although usually painless, takesmany weeks, and there is a high rate of recurrence (ashigh as 50–60% in some regions). Accordingly, surgeryis avoided unless problems due to the pinguecula orpterygium are significant.\\nSeveral methods have been used to attempt to reduce\\nthe recurrence of the pinguecula or pterygium aftersurgery. One method that should be abandoned is betaradiation. Although it is effective at slowing the regrowthof pingueculae and pterygia, it can cause cataracts . A\\npreferable method is the topical application of the anti-cancer drug, mitomycin-C.\\nPrognosis\\nMost pingueculae and pterygia grow slowly and\\nalmost never cause significant damage, so the prognosisis excellent. Again, a diagnosis must be made to rule outother more serious disorders.\\nPrevention\\nThere is nothing that has been clearly shown to pre-\\nvent these disorders, or to prevent a pinguecula from pro-gressing to a pterygium. However, the presence ofpingueculae and pterygia have been linked to exposure toUV radiation. For that reason, UV exposure should bereduced. The American Optometric Association (AOA)suggests that sunglasses should block 99–100% of UV-Aand UV-B rays. Patients should speak to their eye careprofessionals about protective coatings on sunglasses orregular spectacles. Protecting the eyes from sunlight,dust, and other environmental irritants is a good idea.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nGayton, Johnny L., and Jan R. Ledford. The Crystal Clear\\nGuide to Sight for Life.

The word “pinta” comes from the Span-\\nish and means “painted.” Pinta is also known as “azula”(blue), and “mal de pinto” (pinto sickness). It is one ofseveral infections caused by different Treponema bacte-\\nria, which are called “endemic” or “non-venereal” tre-ponematoses.\\nPinta is primarily found in rural, poverty-stricken\\nareas of northern South America, Mexico, and theKEY TERMS\\nAstigmatism —Asymetric vision problems due to\\nirregularities in the cornea.\\nBeta radiation —Streams of electrons emitted by\\nbeta emitters like carbon-14 and radium.\\nConjuctiva —The mucous membrane that covers\\nthe white part of the eyes and lines the eyelids.\\nCornea —The clear outer covering of the front of\\nthe eye. It is in front of the colored part of the eye(iris) and the iris’s central black hole (pupil).Caribbean. The disease is usually acquired during child-\\nhood and is spread from one person to another by directskin-to-skin contact. The bacteria enter the skin througha small cut, scratch, or other skin damage. Once insidethe skin, the warmth and moisture allow the bacteria tomultiply. The bacterial infection causes red, scaly lesionson the skin.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPinta is caused by an infection with the bacterium\\nTreponema carateum . Persons at risk for pinta are those\\nwho live in rural, poverty-stricken, overcrowded regionsof South America, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Symp-toms of pinta occur within two to four weeks after expo-sure to the bacteria. The first sign of infection is a red,scaly, slowly enlarging bump on the skin. This is calledthe “primary lesion.” The primary lesion usually appearsat the site where the bacteria entered the skin. This isoften on the arms, legs, or face. The smaller lesionswhich form around the primary lesion are called “satel-lite lesions.” Lymph nodes located near the infected areawill become enlarged, but are painless.\\nThe second stage of pinta occurs between one and\\n12 months after the primary lesion stage. Many flat, red,scaly, itchy lesions called “pintids” occur either near theprimary lesion, or scattered around the body. Pintidlesions progress through a range of color changes, fromred to bluish-black. The skin of older lesions willbecome depigmented (loss of normal color).\\nDiagnosis\\nPinta can be diagnosed by dermatologists (doctors\\nwho specialize in skin diseases) and infectious diseasespecialists. The appearance of the lesions helps in thediagnosis. A blood sample will be taken from thepatient’s arm to test for antibodies to Treponema cara-\\nteum . A scraping of a lesion will be examined under\\nthe microscope to look for Treponema bacteria. The\\nresults of these tests should be available within one totwo days.\\nTreatment\\nPinta is treated with benzathine penicillin G (Bicillin),\\ngiven as a single injection.\\nPrognosis\\nTreatment will result in a complete cure but will not\\nundo any skin damage caused by the late stages of dis-ease. Spread of pinta to the eyes can cause eyelid defor-mities.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2603Pinta'),\n",

The end result is a proportionate little person,because the height as well as the growth of all otherstructures of the individual are decreased.\\nDescription\\nPituitary dwarfism is caused by problems arising\\nin the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is also calledthe hypophysis. The pituitary gland is divided into twohalves: the anterior (front) and posterior (back) halves.The anterior half produces six hormones: growth hor-mone, adrenocorticotropin (corticotropin), thyroidstimulating homone (thyrotropin), prolactin, folliclestimulating hormone, and lutenizing hormone. Theposterior pituitary gland only produces two hormones.It produces antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) andoxytocin.KEY TERMS\\nLesion —An abnormal change in skin due to dis-\\nease.Most forms of dwarfism are a result of decreased\\nproduction of hormones from the anterior half of thepituitary gland. The most common form is due todecreases of growth hormone which will be discussedhere. These decreases during childhood cause the indi-vidual’s arms, legs, and other structures to develop nor-mal proportions for their bodies, but at a decreased rate.\\nWhen all of the hormones of the anterior pituitary\\ngland are not produced, this is called panhypopituitarism.Another type of dwarfism occurs when only the growthhormone is decreased. Dwarfism can also result from alack of somatomedin C (also called insulin like growthfactor, IGF-1) production. Somatomedin C is a hormoneproduced in the liver that increases bone growth whengrowth hormone is present. The African pygmy and theLevi-Lorain dwarfs lack the ability to producesomatomedin C in response to growth hormone. Allcauses of dwarfism lead to a proportionate little person.\\nGrowth is the body’s response to different hormones.\\nThe forebrain contains a small organ called the hypothala-mus, which is responsible for releasing hormones inresponse to the body’s needs for purposes of regulation.Growth hormone is produced in the anterior pituitarygland when growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH),is released by the hypothalamus. Growth hormone is thenreleased and stimulates the liver to produce IGF-1. Inreturn, IGF-1 stimulates the long bones to grow in length.Thus, growth can be slowed down or stopped if there is aproblem making any of these hormones or if there is aproblem with the cells receiving these hormones.\\nSome estimates show that there are between 10,000\\nand 15,000 children in the United States who havegrowth problems due to a deficiency of growth hormone.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPituitary dwarfism has been shown to run in families.\\nNew investigations are underway to determine the specif-ic cause and location of the gene responsible fordwarfism. The human cell contains 46 chromosomesarranged in 23 pairs. Most of the genes in the two chro-mosomes of each pair are identical or almost identicalwith each other. However, with dwarfism, there appears tobe disruption on different areas of chromosome 3 and 7.Some studies have isolated defects for the production ofpituitary hormones to the short arm (the “p” end) of chro-mosome 3 at a specific location of 3p11. Other studieshave found changes on the short arm of chromosome 7.\\nA child with a growth hormone deficiency is often\\nsmall with an immature face and chubby body build. Thechild’s growth will slow down and not follow the normalgrowth curve patterns.

The patient may also have symptoms of dou-ble vision. Symptoms such as truly bizarre and excessivedrinking behaviors (polydipsia) and sleep disturbancesmay be common.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe primary symptom of pituitary dwarfism is lack\\nof height. Therefore, a change in the individual’s growthhabits will help lead to a diagnosis. Another diagnostictechnique uses an x ray of the child’s hand to determinethe child’s bone age by comparing this to the child’s actu-al chronological age. The bone age in affected children isusually two years or more behind the chronological age.This means that if a child is ten years old, his or her boneswill look like they are those of an eight-year-old child.The levels of growth hormone and somatomedin C mustalso be measured with blood tests.\\nHypopituitarism may be gained or acquired follow-\\ning birth for several reasons. It could be due to trauma tothe pituitary gland such as a fall or following surgery tothe brain for removal of a tumor. It may also be due to thechild’s environment (deprivational dwarfism).On examination by the doctor there may be optic\\nnerve atrophy, if the dwarfism is due to a type of tumor.X rays of the area where the pituitary gland is located(sella turcica) or more advanced imaging such as mag-\\nnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomogra-\\nphy (CT) may show changes of the pituitary gland itself.Computed tomography is an advanced form of x ray thatwill help determine the integrity of the bone and howmuch calcification the tumor is producing. Magnetic res-onance imaging will also help in the diagnosis. MRI is atype of imaging device that can visualize soft tissuessuch as muscle and fat.\\nIf the dwarfism is due to environmental and emo-\\ntional problems, the individual may be hospitalized tomonitor hormone levels. Following a few days of hospi-talization, hormone levels may become normal due toavoidance of the original environment.\\nTreatment\\nThe main course of therapy is growth hormone\\nreplacement therapy when there is lack of growth hor-\\nmone in the body.

Long-termuse is considered successful if the individual grows atleast 0.75 in (2 cm) per year more than they would with-out the hormone.

Some tumors secrete hormones normallymade by the pituitary gland.\\nDescription\\nLocated in the center of the brain, the pituitary gland\\nmanufactures and secretes hormones that regulate growth,sexual development and functioning, and the fluid bal-ance of the body. About 10% of all cancers in the skull arepituitary tumors. Pituitary adenomas (adenomas aretumors that grow from gland tissues) and pituitary tumorsin children and adolescencents (craniopharyngiomas) arethe most common types of pituitary tumors. They are usu-ally benign and grow slowly. Even malignant pituitarytumors rarely spread to other parts of the body.\\nPituitary adenomas do not secrete hormones but are\\nlikely to be larger and more invasive than tumors that do.Craniopharyngiomas are benign tumors that are extreme-ly difficult to remove. Radiation does not stop them fromspreading throughout the pituitary gland. Craniopharyn-giomas account for less than 5% of all brain tumors.Pituitary tumors usually develop between the ages of 30and 40, but half of all craniopharyngiomas occur in chil-dren, with symptoms most often appearing between theages of five and ten.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of pituitary tumors is not known, but may\\nbe genetic. Symptoms related to tumor location, size, andpressure on neighboring structures include:\\n• persistent headache on one or both sides, or in the cen-\\nter of the forehead\\n• blurred or double vision; loss of peripheral vision• drooping eyelid caused by pressure on nerves leading\\nto the eye\\n• seizures\\nSymptoms related to hormonal imbalance include:\\n• excessive sweating• loss of appetite• loss of interest in sex• inability to tolerate cold temperatures• nausea• high levels of sodium in the blood• menstrual problems\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2607Pituitary tumors'),\n",

This condition is considered an emer-gency. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best\\nimaging technique for patients with these symptoms.

Selected patients do well with\\nproton beam radiosurgery (the use of high energy parti-cles in the form of a high energy beam to destroy anoveractive gland).\\nTreatment is determined by the type of tumor and\\nby whether it has invaded tissues adjacent to the pitu-itary gland. Hormone-secreting tumors can be success-fully treated with surgery, radiation, bromocriptine(Parlodel), Sandostatin (Octreotide), or other somato-statin analogues (drugs similar to somatostatin).Surgery is usually used to remove all or part of a tumorwithin the gland or the area surrounding it, and may becombined with radiation therapy to treat tumors that\\nextend beyond the pituitary gland. Removal of the pitu-itary gland requires life-long hormone replacement\\ntherapy .\\nRadiation therapy can provide long-term control of\\nthe disease if it recurs after surgery, and radioactive pel-lets can be implanted in the brain to treat craniopharyn-giomas.

The lowest segmentof the uterus is a narrowed portion called the cervix. Thiscervix has an opening (the os) that leads into the vagina,or birth canal. The placenta is the organ that attaches tothe wall of the uterus during pregnancy. The placentaallows nutrients and oxygen from the mother’s blood cir-culation to pass into the developing baby (the fetus) viathe umbilical cord.\\nDuring labor, the muscles of the uterus contract\\nrepeatedly. This allows the cervix to begin to grow thin-ner (called effacement) and more open (dilatation).Eventually, the cervix will become completely effacedand dilated, and the baby can leave the uterus and enterthe birth canal. Under normal circumstances, the babywill emerge through the mother’s vagina during birth.\\nIn placenta previa, the placenta develops in an\\nabnormal location. Normally, the placenta should devel-op relatively high up in the uterus, on the front or backwall. In about one in 200 births, the placenta will belocated low in the uterus, partially or totally covering theos. This causes particular problems in late pregnancy,when the lower part of the uterus begins to take on a newformation in preparation for delivery. As the cervixbegins to efface and dilate, the attachments of the placen-ta to the uterus are damaged, resulting in bleeding.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nWhile the actual cause of placenta previa is\\nunknown, certain factors increase the risk of a womandeveloping the condition. These factors include:\\n• having abnormalities of the uterus• being older in age• having had other babies• having a prior delivery by cesarean section\\n• smoking cigarettes\\nWhen a pregnancy involves more than one baby\\n(twins, triplets, etc.), the placenta will be considerablylarger than for a single pregnancy. This also increases thechance of placenta previa.\\nPlacenta previa may cause a number of problems. It\\nis thought to be responsible for about 5% of all miscar-riages. It frequently causes very light bleeding (spotting)early in pregnancy. Sometime after 28 weeks of pregnan-cy (most pregnancies last about 40 weeks), placenta pre-via can cause episodes of significant bleeding. Usually,the bleeding occurs suddenly and is bright red. Thewoman rarely experiences any accompanying pain ,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2610Placenta previa'),\n",

The bleeding usually stops on itsown. About 25% of such patients will go into labor withinthe next several days. Sometimes, placenta previa doesnot cause bleeding until labor has already begun.\\nPlacenta previa puts both the mother and the fetus at\\nhigh risk. The mother is at risk of severe and uncontrol-lable bleeding (hemorrhage), with dangerous blood loss.If the mother’s bleeding is quite severe, this puts the fetusat risk of becoming oxygen deprived. The fetus’ onlysource of oxygen is the mother’s blood. The mother’sblood loss, coupled with certain changes that take placein response to that blood loss, decreases the amount ofblood going to the placenta, and ultimately to the fetus.Furthermore, placenta previa increases the risk ofpreterm labor, and the possibility that the baby will bedelivered prematurely.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of placenta previa is suspected whenever\\nbright red, painless vaginal bleeding occurs during thecourse of a pregnancy. The diagnosis can be confirmedby performing an ultrasound examination. This willallow the location of the placenta to be evaluated.\\nWhile many conditions during pregnancy require a\\npelvic examination, in which the health care provider’sfingers are inserted into the patient’s vagina, such anexamination should never be performed if there is any sus-picion of placenta previa. Such an examination can disturbthe already susceptible placenta, resulting in hemorrhage.\\nSometimes placenta previa is found early in a preg-\\nnancy, during an ultrasound examination performed foranother reason. In these cases, it is wise to have a repeatultrasound performed later in pregnancy (during the lastthird of the pregnancy, called the third trimester). A largepercentage of these women will have a low-lying placen-ta, but not a true placenta previa where some or all of theos is covered.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment depends on how far along in the pregnan-\\ncy the bleeding occurs. When the pregnancy is less than36 weeks along, the fetus is not sufficiently developed toallow delivery without a high risk of complications.Therefore, a woman with placenta previa is treated withbed rest, blood transfusions as necessary, and medica-tions to prevent labor. After 36 weeks, the baby can bedelivered via cesarean section. This is almost always thepreferred method of delivery in order to avoid furtherbleeding from the low-lying placenta.KEY TERMS\\nCesarean section —Delivery of a baby through an\\nincision in the mother’s abdomen instead ofthrough the vagina.\\nLabor —The process during which the uterus con-\\ntracts and the cervix opens to allow the passage ofa baby into the vagina.\\nPlacenta —The organ that provides oxygen and\\nnutrition from the mother to the baby during preg-nancy.

About 60% of thesedeaths occur because the baby delivered was too prema-ture to survive.\\nPrevention\\nThere are no known ways to insure the appropriate\\nplacement of the placenta in the uterus.

Pla-cental abruption occurs in about one out of every 200deliveries. African-American and Latin-Americanwomen have a greater risk of this complication than doCaucasian women. It was once believed that the risk ofplacental abruption increased in women who gave birthto many children, but this association is still beingresearched.Causes and symptoms\\nThe cause of placental abruption is unknown. How-\\never, a number of risk factors have been identified. Thesefactors include:\\n• older age of the mother• history of placental abruption during a previous preg-\\nnancy\\n• high blood pressure\\n• certain disease states (diabetes, collagen vascular dis-\\neases)\\n• the presence of a type of uterine tumor called a leiomy-\\noma\\n• twins, triplets, or other multiple pregnancies\\n• cigarette smoking\\n• heavy alcohol use\\n•cocaine use\\n• malformations of the uterus• malformations of the placenta\\n• injury to the abdomen (as might occur in a car accident)\\nSymptoms of placental abruption include bleeding\\nfrom the vagina, severe pain in the abdomen or back, and\\ntenderness of the uterus. Depending on the severity of thebleeding, the mother may experience a drop in bloodpressure, followed by symptoms of organ failure as herorgans are deprived of oxygen. Sometimes, there is novisible vaginal bleeding. Instead, the bleeding is said tobe “concealed.” In this case, the bleeding is trappedbehind the placenta, or there may be bleeding into themuscle of the uterus. Many patients will have abnormalcontractions of the uterus, particularly extremely hard,prolonged contractions. Placental abruption can be total(in which case the fetus will almost always die in theuterus), or partial.\\nPlacental abruption can also cause a very serious\\ncomplication called consumptive coagulopathy. A seriesof reactions begin that involve the elements of the bloodresponsible for clotting. These clotting elements arebound together and used up by these reactions. Thisincreases the risk of uncontrollable bleeding and maycontribute to severe bleeding from the uterus, as well ascausing bleeding from other locations (nose, urinarytract, etc.).\\nPlacental abruption is risky for both the mother and\\nthe fetus. It is dangerous for the mother because ofblood loss, loss of clotting ability, and oxygen depriva-tion to her organs (especially the kidneys and heart).This condition is dangerous for the fetus because ofoxygen deprivation, too, since the mother’s blood is the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2612Placental abruption'),\n",

Because the abrupting\\nplacenta is attached to the umbilical cord, and theumbilical cord is an extension of the fetus’ circulatorysystem, the fetus is also at risk of hemorrhaging. Thefetus may die from these stresses, or may be born withdamage due to oxygen deprivation. If the abruptionoccurs well before the baby was due to be delivered,early delivery may cause the baby to suffer complica-tions of premature birth.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of placental abruption relies heavily on\\nthe patient’s report of her symptoms and a physical\\nexamination performed by a health care provider. Ultra-\\nsound can sometimes be used to diagnose an abruption,but there is a high rate of missed or incorrect diagnosesassociated with this tool when used for this purpose.Blood will be taken from the mother and tested to evalu-ate the possibility of life-threatening problems with themother’s clotting system.\\nTreatment\\nThe first line of treatment for placental abruption\\ninvolves replacing the mother’s lost blood with bloodtransfusions and fluids given through a needle in a vein.Oxygen will be administered, usually by a mask orthrough tubes leading to the nose. When the placentalseparation is severe, treatment may require prompt deliv-ery of the baby. However, delivery may be delayed whenthe placental separation is not as severe, and when thefetus is too immature to insure a healthy baby if deliv-ered. The baby is delivered vaginally when possible.However, a cesarean section may be performed to deliv-\\ner the baby more quickly if the abruption is quite severeor if the baby is in distress.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for cases of placental abruption\\nvaries, depending on the severity of the abruption. Therisk of death for the mother ranges up to 5%, usually due\\nto severe blood loss, heart failure , and kidney failure. In\\ncases of severe abruption, 50–80% of all fetuses die.Among those who survive, nearly half will have lifelongproblems due to oxygen deprivation in the uterus andpremature birth.\\nPrevention\\nSome of the causes of placental abruption are pre-\\nventable. These include cigarette smoking, alcoholabuse, and cocaine use. Other causes of abruption maynot be avoidable, like diabetes or high blood pressure.KEY TERMS\\nCesarean section —Delivery of a baby through an\\nincision in the mother’s abdomen, instead ofthrough the vagina.\\nLabor —The process during which the uterus con-\\ntracts, and the cervix opens to allow the passageof a baby into the vagina.\\nPlacenta —The organ that provides oxygen and\\nnutrition from the mother to the baby during preg-nancy.

It was one of the scourges ofour early history. There are three major forms of the dis-ease: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic.\\nDescription\\nPlague has been responsible for three great world\\npandemics, which caused millions of deaths and signifi-cantly altered the course of history. A pandemic is a dis-ease occurring in epidemic form throughout the entirepopulation of a country, a people, or the world. Althoughthe cause of the plague was not identified until the thirdpandemic in 1894, scientists are virtually certain that thefirst two pandemics were plague because a number of thesurvivors wrote about their experiences and described thesymptoms.\\nThe first great pandemic appeared in \\nA.D. 542 and\\nlasted for 60 years. It killed millions of citizens, particu-larly along the Mediterranean Sea. This sea was thebusiest, coastal trade route at that time and connectedwhat is now southern Europe, northern Africa, and partsof coastal Asia.\\nThe second pandemic occurred during the fourteenth\\ncentury, and was called “Black Death” because its mainsymptom was the appearance of black patches (caused bybleeding) on the skin. It was also a subject found in manyEuropean paintings, drawings, plays, and writings of thattime. The connections between large, active trading ports,rats coming off the ships, and the severe outbreaks of theplague was known by the people. This was the mostsevere of the three, beginning in the mid-1300s with anorigin in central Asia and lasting for 400 years. About afourth of the entire European population died within afew years after plague was first introduced.\\nThe final pandemic began in northern China, reach-\\ning Canton and Hong Kong by 1894. From there, itspread to all continents, killing millions.\\nThe great pandemics of the past occurred when wild\\nrodents spread the disease to rats in cities, and then tohumans when the rats died. Another route for infectioncame from rats coming off ships that had traveled fromheavily infected areas. Generally, these were busy coastalor inland trade routes. Plague was introduced into theUnited States during this pandemic and it spread fromthe West towards the Midwest and became endemic inthe Southwest of the United States.Between 10 and 50 Americans living in the south-\\nwestern United States contract plague each year duringthe spring and summer. The last rat-borne epidemic inthe United States occurred in Los Angeles in 1924–25.Since then, all plague cases in this country have beensporadic, acquired from wild rodents or their fleas.Plague can also be acquired from ground squirrels andprairie dogs in parts of Arizona, New Mexico, California,Colorado, and Nevada. Around the world, there arebetween 1,000 and 2,000 cases of plague each year.Recent outbreaks in humans occurred in Africa, SouthAmerica, and Southeast Asia.\\nSome people and/or animals with bubonic plague go\\non to develop pneumonia (pneumonic plague). This can\\nspread to others via infected droplets during coughing orsneezing.\\nPlague is one of three diseases still subject to inter-\\nnational health regulations. These rules require that allconfirmed cases be reported to the World Health Organi-zation (WHO) within 24 hours of diagnosis. Accordingto the 1998 regulations, passengers on an internationalvoyage who have been to an area where there is an epi-demic of pneumonic plague must be placed in isolationfor six days before being allowed to leave.\\nWhile plague is found in several countries, there is\\nlittle risk to United States travelers within endemic areas(limited locales where a disease is known to be present)if they restrict their travel to urban areas with modernhotel accommodations.\\nOver the past few years, this infection primarily of\\ninantiquity has become a modern issue. This change hasoccurred because of the concerns about the use of plagueas a weapon of biological warfare or terrorism. Alongwith anthrax and smallpox , plague is considered to be a\\nsignificant risk. In this scenario, the primary manifesta-tion is likely to be pneumonic plague transmitted byclandestine aerosols. It has been reported that duringWorld War II the Japanese dropped “bombs” containingplague-infected fleas in China as a form of biowarfare.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nFleas carry the bacterium Yersinia pestis . When a\\nflea bites an infected rodent, it swallows the plague bac-teria. The bacteria is passed on when the fleas, in turn,bite a human. Interestingly, the plague bacterium growsin the gullet of the flea, obstructing it and not allowingthe flea to eat. Transmission occurs during abortive feed-ing with regurgitation of bacteria into the feeding site.Humans also may become infected if they have a breakor cut in the skin and come in direct contact with bodyfluids or tissues of infected animals.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2614Plague'),\n",

All but one of the few pneumonic caseshave been associated with handling infected cats. Whiledogs and cats can become infected, dogs rarely showsigns of illness and are not believed to spread disease tohumans. However, plague has been spread from infectedcoyotes (wild dogs) to humans.\\nBubonic plague\\nTwo to five days after infection, patients experience\\na sudden fever , chills, seizures, and severe headaches,\\nfollowed by the appearance of swellings or “buboes” inarmpits, groin, and neck. The most commonly affectedsites are the lymph glands near the site of the first infec-tion. As the bacteria multiply in the glands, the lymphnode becomes swollen. As the nodes collect fluid, theybecome extremely tender. Occasionally, the bacteria willcause an ulcer at the point of the first infection.\\nSepticemic plague\\nBacteria that invade the bloodstream directly (with-\\nout involving the lymph nodes) causes septicemicplague. (Bubonic plague also can progress to septicemicplague if not treated appropriately.) Septicemic plaguethat does not involve the lymph glands is particularly\\ndangerous because it can be hard to diagnose the disease.The bacteria usually spread to other sites, including theliver, kidneys, spleen, lungs, and sometimes the eyes, orthe lining of the brain. Symptoms include fever, chills,prostration, abdominal pain ,shock , and bleeding into\\nthe skin and organs.\\nPneumonic plague\\nPneumonic plague may occur as a direct infection\\n(primary) or as a result of untreated bubonic or sep-ticemic plague (secondary). Primary pneumonic plagueis caused by inhaling infective drops from another personor animal with pneumonic plague. Symptoms, whichappear within one to three days after infection, include asevere, overwhelming pneumonia, with shortness of\\nbreath , high fever, and blood in the phlegm.

Alternatives include gentamicin, chloram-phenicol, tetracycline, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.\\nPrognosis\\nPlague can be treated successfully if it is caught\\nearly. Untreated pneumonic plague is almost alwaysfatal, however, and the chances of survival are very lowunless specific antibiotic treatment is started within15–18 hours after symptoms appear.

Anyone working in arodent-infested area should wear insect repellent on skinand clothing. Pets can be treated with insecticidal dustand kept indoors.

PRA is alsoused to further evaluate a diagnosis of excess aldos-terone, a hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex, in acondition called Conn’s syndrome.\\nPrecautions\\nPatients taking diuretics , antihypertensives,\\nvasodilators ,oral contraceptives , and licorice should\\ndiscontinue use of these substances for two to four weeksbefore the test. It should be noted that renin is increasedin pregnancy and in diets with reduced salt intake. Also,\\nsince renin is affected by body position, as well as bydiurnal (daily) variation, blood samples should be drawnin the morning, and the position of the patient (sitting orlying down) should be noted.\\nDescription\\nWhen the kidneys release the enzyme renin in\\nresponse to certain conditions (high blood potassium,low blood sodium, decreased blood volume), it is the firststep in what is called the renin-angiotensin-aldosteronecycle. This cycle includes the conversion of angio-tensinogen to angiotensin I, which in turn is converted toangiotensin II, in the lung. Angiotensin II is a powerfulblood vessel constrictor, and its action stimulates therelease of aldosterone from an area of the adrenal glandscalled the adrenal cortex. Together, angiotensin andaldosterone increase the blood volume, the blood pres-sure, and the blood sodium to re-establish the body’ssodium-potassium and fluid volume balance. Primaryaldosteronism, the symptoms of which include hyperten-sion and low blood potassium ( hypokalemia ), is consid-\\nered “low-renin aldosteronism.”\\nRenin itself is not actually measured in the PRA test,\\nbecause renin can be measured only with great difficultyeven in research laboratories. In the most commonlyused renin assay, the test actually determines, by a proce-dure called radioimmunoassay, the rate of angiotensin Igeneration per unit time, while the PRC (plasma reninconcentration) measures the maximum renin effect.\\nBoth the PRA and the PRC are extremely difficult to\\nperform. Not only is renin itself unstable, but thepatient’s body position and the time of day affect theresults. Also, the sample must be collected properly:drawn into a chilled syringe and collection tube, placedon ice, and sent to the performing laboratory immediate-ly. Even if all these procedures are followed, results canvary significantly.\\nA determination of the PRA and a measurement of\\nthe plasma aldosterone level are used in the differentialdiagnosis of primary and secondary hyperaldostero-\\nnism . Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism (caused\\nby an adrenal tumor that overproduces aldosterone) willhave an increased aldosterone level with decreased reninactivity. Conversely, patients with secondary hyperaldos-teronism (caused by certain types of kidney disease) willhave increased levels of renin.\\nRenin stimulation test\\nThe renin stimulation test is performed to help diag-\\nnose and distinguish the two forms of hyperaldosteronism.With the patient having been on a low-salt diet and lying\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2617Plasma renin activity'),\n",

The\\nPRA is repeated with the patient still on the low-salt dietbut now standing upright. In cases of primary hyperaldos-teronism, the blood volume is greatly expanded, and achange in position or reduced salt intake does not result indecreased kidney blood flow or decreased blood sodium.As a result, renin levels do not increase. However, in sec-ondary hyperaldosteronism, blood sodium levels decreasewith a lowered salt intake, and when the patient is standingupright, the kidney blood flow decreases as well. Conse-quently, renin levels do increase.\\nCaptopril test\\nThe captopril test is a screening test for hypertension\\nof kidney origin ( renovascular hypertension ). For this\\ntest, a baseline PRA test is done first, then the patientreceives an oral dose of captopril, which is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Blood pressure mea-surements are taken at this time and again at 60 minuteswhen another PRA test is done. Patients with kidney-based hypertension demonstrate greater falls in bloodpressure and increases in PRA after captopril administra-tion than do those with essential hypertension. Conse-quently, the captopril test is an excellent screening proce-dure to determine the need for a more invasive radiograph-ic evaluation such as renal arteriography.\\nPreparation\\nThis test requires a blood sample. For the PRA, the\\npatient should maintain a normal diet with a restrictedamount of sodium (approximately 3 g per day) for three daysbefore the test. It is recommended that the patient be fasting\\n(nothing to eat or drink) from midnight the day of the test.\\nRisks\\nRisks for this test are minimal, but may include\\nslight bleeding from the puncture site, fainting or feeling\\nlightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma (bloodaccumulating under the puncture site).\\nNormal results\\nReference values for the PRA test are laboratory-\\nspecific and depend upon the kind of diet (sodiumrestricted or normal), the age of the patient, and thepatient’s posture at the time of the test. Values are alsoaffected if renin has been stimulated or if the patient hasreceived an ACE inhibitor, like captopril.\\nAbnormal results\\nIncreased PRA levels are seen in essential hyper-\\ntension (uncommon), malignant hypertension, and kid-KEY TERMS\\nAldosteronism —A disorder caused by excessive\\nproduction of the hormone aldosterone, which isproduced by a part of the adrenal glands calledthe adrenal cortex.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 325}, page_content='Purpose\\nIn an autoimmune disease, the immune system\\nattacks the body’s own tissues. In many autoimmune dis-eases, the chief weapons of attack are antibodies, pro-teins that circulate in the bloodstream until they meet andbind with the target tissue. Once bound, they impair thefunctions of the target, and signal other immune compo-nents to respond as well.\\nPlasmapheresis is used to remove antibodies from\\nthe bloodstream, thereby preventing them from attackingtheir targets. It does not directly affect the immune sys-tem’s ability to make more antibodies, and therefore mayonly offer temporary benefit. This procedure is most use-ful in acute, self-limited disorders such as Guillain-\\nBarré syndrome , or when chronic disorders, such as\\nmyasthenia gravis , become more severe in symptoms.\\nIn these instances, a rapid improvement could save thepatient’s life. Neurologic diseases comprise 90% of thediseases that could profit from plasmapheresis.\\nPrecautions\\nPatients with clotting disorders may not be suitable\\ncandidates for plasmapheresis.\\nDescription\\nThe basic procedure consists of removal of blood,\\nseparation of blood cells from plasma, and return ofthese blood cells to the body’s circulation, diluted withfresh plasma or a substitute. Because of concerns overviral infection and allergic reaction, fresh plasma is notroutinely used. Instead, the most common substitute issaline solution with sterilized human albumin protein.During the course of a single session, two to three litersof plasma is removed and replaced.\\nPlasmapheresis requires insertion of a venous\\ncatheter, either in a limb or central vein. Central veinsallow higher flow rates and are more convenient forrepeat procedures, but are more often the site of compli-cations, especially bacterial infection.\\nWhen blood is outside the body, it must be treated to\\nprevent it from clotting. While most of the anticlottingagent is removed from the blood during treatment, someis returned to the patient.\\nThree procedures are available:\\n• “Discontinuous flow centrifugation.” Only one venous\\ncatheter line is required. Approximately 300 ml ofblood is removed at a time and centrifuged to separateplasma from blood cells.• ”Continuous flow centrifugation.” Two venous lines are\\nused. This method requires slightly less blood volumeto be out of the body at any one time.\\n• ”Plasma filtration.” Two venous lines are used. The\\npasma is filtered using standard hemodialysis equip-ment. It requires less than 100 ml of blood to be outsidethe body at one time.\\nA single plasmapheresis session may be effective,\\nalthough it is more common to have several sessions perweek over the course of two weeks or more.\\nPreparation\\nGood nutrition and plenty of rest make the proce-\\ndure less stressful. The treating physician determineswhich of the patient’s medications should be discontin-ued before the plasmapheresis session.\\nAftercare\\nThe patient may experience dizziness , nausea,\\nnumbness, tingling, or lightheadedness during or afterthe procedure. These effects usually pass quickly, allow-ing the patient to return to normal activities the same day.\\nRisks\\nReinfusion (replacement) with human plasma may\\ncause anaphylaxis , a life threatening allergic reaction.\\nAll procedures may cause a mild allergic reaction, lead-ing to fever , chills, and rash. Bacterial infection is a risk,\\nespecially when a central venous catheter is used. Reac-tion to the citrate anticoagulant used may cause crampsand numbness, though these usually resolve on theirown.

These types of surgery are highly special-ized. They are characterized by careful preparation of thepatient’s skin and tissues, by precise cutting and suturingtechniques, and by care taken to minimize scarring.Recent advances in the development of miniaturizedinstruments, new materials for artificial limbs and bodyparts, and improved surgical techniques have expanded therange of plastic surgery operations that can be performed.\\nPurpose\\nAlthough these three types of surgery share some\\ncommon techniques and approaches, they have some-what different emphases. Plastic surgery is usually per-formed to treat birth defects and to remove skin blem-\\nishes such as warts ,acne scars, or birthmarks . Cosmet-\\nic surgery procedures are performed to make the patientlook younger or enhance his or her appearance in otherways. Reconstructive surgery is used to reattach bodyparts severed in combat or accidents, to perform skingrafts after severe burns , or to reconstruct parts of the\\npatient’s body that were missing at birth or removed bysurgery. Reconstructive surgery is the oldest form ofplastic surgery, having developed out of the need to treatwounded soldiers in wartime.\\nPrecautions\\nMedical\\nSome patients should not have plastic surgery\\nbecause of certain medical risks.

Many people who are born with visible deformi-ties or disfigured by accidents later in life develop emo-tional problems related to social rejection. Other peoplework in fields such as acting, modeling, media journal-ism, and even politics, where their employment dependson how they look. Some people have unrealistic expecta-tions of cosmetic surgery and think that it will solve alltheir life problems. It is important for anyone consider-ing nonemergency plastic or cosmetic surgery to be real-istic about its results. One type of psychiatric disorder,called body dysmorphic disorder, is characterized by anexcessive preoccupation with imaginary or minor flawsin appearance. Patients with this disorder frequently seekunnecessary plastic surgery.\\nDescription\\nPlastic surgery\\nPlastic surgery includes a number of different proce-\\ndures that usually involve skin. Operations to removeexcess fat from the abdomen (“tummy tucks”), der-mabrasion to remove acne scars or tattoos, and reshapingthe cartilage in children’s ears (otoplasty) are commonapplications of plastic surgery.\\nCosmetic surgery\\nMost cosmetic surgery is done on the face. It is intend-\\ned either to correct disfigurement or to enhance thepatient’s features. The most common cosmetic procedurefor children is correction of a cleft lip or palate. In adults,the most common procedures are remodeling of the nose(rhinoplasty ), removal of baggy skin around the eyelids\\n(blepharoplasty ), facelifts (rhytidectomy), or changing the\\nsize of the breasts (mammoplasty). Although many peoplestill think of cosmetic surgery as only for women, growingnumbers of men are choosing to have facelifts and eyelidsurgery, as well as hair transplants and “tummy tucks.”\\nReconstructive surgery\\nReconstructive surgery is often performed on burn\\nand accident victims. It may involve the rebuilding ofseverely fractured bones, as well as skin grafting .\\nReconstructive surgery includes such procedures as thereattachment of an amputated finger or toe, or implantinga prosthesis. Prostheses are artificial structures and mate-rials that are used to replace missing limbs or teeth, orarthritic hip and knee joints.\\nPreparation\\nPreparation for nonemergency plastic or reconstruc-\\ntive surgery includes patient education, as well as medicalconsiderations. Some operations, such as nose reshaping\\nor the removal of warts, small birthmarks, and tattoos canbe done as outpatient procedures under local anesthesia.Most plastic and reconstructive surgery, however,involves a stay in the hospital and general anesthesia.\\nMedical preparation\\nPreparation for plastic surgery includes the sur-\\ngeon’s detailed assessment of the parts of the patient’sbody that will be involved. Skin grafts require evaluatingsuitable areas of the patient’s skin for the right color andtexture to match the skin at the graft site. Facelifts andcosmetic surgery in the eye area require very close atten-tion to the texture of the skin and the placement of surgi-cal cuts (incisions).\\nPatients scheduled for plastic surgery under general\\nanesthesia will be given a physical examination , blood\\nand urine tests, and other tests to make sure that they donot have any previously undetected health problems orblood clotting disorders. The doctor will check the list ofprescription medications that the patient may be taking tomake sure that none of them will interfere with normalblood clotting or interact with the anesthetic.\\nPatients are asked to avoid using aspirin or medica-\\ntions containing aspirin for a week to two weeks beforesurgery, because these drugs lengthen the time of bloodclotting. Smokers are asked to stop smoking two weeks\\nbefore surgery because smoking interferes with the heal-ing process. For some types of plastic surgery, the patientmay be asked to donate several units of his or her ownblood before the procedure, in case a transfusion is\\nneeded during the operation. The patient will be asked tosign a consent form before the operation.\\nPatient education\\nThe doctor will meet with the patient before the\\noperation is scheduled, in order to explain the procedure\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2621Plastic, cosmetic, and reconstructive surgery\\nThe Top 10 Elective Cosmetic Surgeries In The U.S.\\n(1999)\\nProcedure Female Patients Male Patients Total\\nLiposuction 201,083 29,782 230,865\\nBreast augmentation 167,318 0 167,318Eyelid surgery 120,160 21,859 142,033Face lift 66,096 6,697 72,793Tummy tuck 52,888 2,089 54,977Collagen injections 48,989 4,208 53,197Chemical peel 47,359 4,215 51,589Laser skin resurfacing 46,162 4,343 50,505Rhinoplasty 34,761 11,831 46,596Forehead lift 36,995 3,962 40,969'),\n",

They play a major role in the blood-clotting process. The platelet aggregation test is a mea-sure of platelet function.\\nPurpose\\nThe platelet aggregation test aids in the evaluation\\nof bleeding disorders by measuring the rate and degreeto which platelets form a clump (aggregate) after theaddition of a chemical that stimulates clumping (aggre-gation).\\nPrecautions\\nThere are many medications that can affect the results\\nof the platelet aggregation test. The patient should discon-tinue as many as possible beforehand. Some of the drugsthat can decrease platelet aggregation include aspirin ,\\nsome antibiotics ,beta blockers , dextran (Macrodex),\\nalcohol, heparin (Lipo-Hepin), nonsteroidal anti-inflam-\\nmatory drugs (NSAIDs), tricyclic antidepressants, and\\nwarfarin (Coumadin).\\nDescription\\nThere are many factors involved in blood clotting\\n(coagulation). One of the first steps in the processinvolves small cells in the bloodstream called platelets,which are produced in the bone marrow. Platelets gatherat the site of an injury and clump together to form a plug,or aggregate, that helps to limit the loss of blood and pro-mote healing.\\nInherited bleeding disorders (e.g., hemophilia or\\nvon Willebrand’s disease) and acquired bleeding prob-lems that occur because of another disorder or a med-ication can affect the number of platelets and their levelof function. When these problems are present, the resultis a drop in platelet aggregation and a lengthenedbleeding time .\\nThe platelet aggregation test uses a machine called\\nan aggregometer to measure the cloudiness (turbidity) ofblood plasma. Several different substances called ago-nists are used in the test. These agonists include adeno-sine diphosphate, epinephrine, thrombin, collagen, andristocetin. The addition of an agonist to a plasma samplecauses the platelets to clump together, making the fluidmore transparent. The aggregometer then measures theincreased light transmission through the specimen.KEY TERMS\\nAggregation —The blood cell clumping process\\nthat is measured in the platelet aggregation test.\\nAgonist —A chemical that is added to the blood\\nsample in the platelet aggregation test to stimulatethe clumping process.\\nHemophilia —An inherited bleeding disorder caused\\nby a deficiency of factor VIII, one of a series of bloodproteins essential for blood clotting.\\nPlatelets —Small, round, disk-shaped blood cells\\nthat are involved in clot formation.

Flores\\nPlatelet count\\nDefinition\\nA platelet count is a diagnostic test that determines\\nthe number of platelets in the patient’s blood. Platelets,which are also called thrombocytes, are small disk-shapedblood cells produced in the bone marrow and involved inthe process of blood clotting. There are normally between150,000-450,000 platelets in each microliter of blood.Low platelet counts or abnormally shaped platelets areassociated with bleeding disorders. High platelet countssometimes indicate disorders of the bone marrow.\\nPurpose\\nThe primary functions of a platelet count are to\\nassist in the diagnosis of bleeding disorders and to moni-tor patients who are being treated for any disease involv-ing bone marrow failure. Patients who have leukemia,polycythemia vera , or aplastic anemia are given peri-\\nodic platelet count tests to monitor their health.\\nDescription\\nBlood collection and storage\\nPlatelet counts use a freshly-collected blood speci-\\nmen to which a chemical called EDTA has been added toprevent clotting before the test begins. About 5 mL ofblood are drawn from a vein in the patient’s inner elbowregion. Blood drawn from a vein helps to produce a moreaccurate count than blood drawn from a fingertip. Col-lection of the sample takes only a few minutes.\\nAfter collection, the mean platelet volume of EDTA-\\nblood will increase over time. This increase is caused bya change in the shape of the platelets after removal fromthe body. The changing volume is relatively stable for aperiod of one to three hours after collection. This periodis the best time to count the sample when using electron-ic instruments, because the platelets will be within astandard size range.\\nCounting methods\\nPlatelets can be observed in a direct blood smear for\\napproximate quantity and shape. A direct smear is madeby placing a drop of blood onto a microscope slide andspreading it into a thin layer. After staining to make thevarious blood cells easier to see and distinguish, a labora-tory technician views the smear through a light micro-scope. Accurate assessment of the number of plateletsrequires other methods of counting. There are threemethods used to count platelets; hemacytometer, voltage-pulse counting, and electro-optical counting.\\nHEMACYTOMETER COUNTING. The microscopic\\nmethod uses a phase contrast microscope to view bloodon a hemacytometer slide. A sample of the diluted bloodmixture is placed in a hemacytometer, which is an instru-ment with a grid etched into its surface to guide thecounting. For a proper count, the platelets should beevenly distributed in the hemacytometer. Counts madefrom samples with platelet clumping are consideredunreliable. Clumping can be caused by several factors,such as clotting before addition of the anticoagulant andallowing the blood to remain in contact with a capillaryblood vessel during collection. Errors in platelet count-ing are more common when blood is collected from cap-illaries than from veins.\\nELECTRONIC COUNTING. Electronic counting of\\nplatelets is the most common method.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 331}, page_content='optical counting systems. In both systems, the collected\\nblood is diluted and counted by passing the bloodthrough an electronic counter. The instruments are set tocount only particles within the proper size range forplatelets. The upper and lower levels of the size range arecalled size exclusion limits. Any cells or material largeror smaller than the size exclusion limits will not becounted. Any object in the proper size range is counted,however, even if it isn’t a platelet. For these instrumentsto work properly, the sample must not contain othermaterial that might mistakenly be counted as platelets.Electronic counting instruments sometimes produce arti-ficially low platelet counts. If a platelet and anotherblood cell pass through the counter at the same time, theinstrument will not count the larger cell because of thesize exclusion limits, which will cause the instrument toaccidentally miss the platelet. Clumps of platelets willnot be counted because clumps exceed the upper sizeexclusion limit for platelets. In addition, if the patient hasa high white blood cell count, electronic counting mayyield an unusually low platelet count because whiteblood cells may filter out some of the platelets before thesample is counted. On the other hand, if the red bloodcells in the sample have burst, their fragments will befalsely counted as platelets.\\nAftercare\\nBecause platelet counts are sometimes ordered to\\ndiagnose or monitor bleeding disorders, patients withthese disorders should be cautioned to watch the punc-ture site for signs of additional bleeding.\\nRisks\\nRisks for a platelet count test are minimal in normal\\nindividuals. Patients with bleeding disorders, however,may have prolonged bleeding from the puncture woundor the formation of a bruise (hematoma) under the skinwhere the blood was withdrawn.\\nNormal results\\nThe normal range for a platelet count is 150,000-\\n450,000 platelets per microliter of blood.\\nAbnormal results\\nAn abnormally low platelet level ( thrombocytope-\\nnia) is a condition that may result from increased\\ndestruction of platelets, decreased production, orincreased usage of platelets. In idiopathic thrombocy-\\ntopenic purpura (ITP), platelets are destroyed at abnor-\\nmally high rates. Hypersplenism is characterized by the\\ncollection (sequestration) of platelets in the spleen.

When they do this, the platelets trigger a series of\\nchemical changes that result in the formation of a bloodclot. There are certain hereditary disorders that affectplatelet function and impair their ability to start theprocess of blood clot formation. One result is the possi-bility of excessive bleeding from minor injuries or men-strual flow.\\nDescription\\nPlatelets are formed in the bone marrow—a spongy\\ntissue located inside the long bones of the body—as frag-ments of a large precursor cell (a megakaryocyte). Thesefragments circulate in the bloodstream and form the firstline of defense against blood escaping from injuredblood vessels.\\nDamaged blood vessels release a chemical signal that\\nincreases the stickiness of platelets in the area of the injury.The sticky platelets adhere to the damaged area and gradu-ally form a platelet plug. At the same time, the plateletsrelease a series of chemical signals that prompt other fac-tors in the blood to reinforce the platelet plug. Between theplatelet and its reinforcements, a sturdy clot is created thatacts as a patch while the damaged area heals.\\nThere are several hereditary disorders characterized\\nby some impairment of the platelet’s action. Examplesinclude von Willebrand’s disease, Glanzmann’s throm-basthenia, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome . Vulnerable\\naspects of platelet function include errors in the produc-tion of the platelets themselves or errors in the formation,storage, or release of their chemical signals. Thesedefects can prevent platelets from responding to injuriesor from prompting the action of other factors involved inclot formation.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPlatelet function disorders can be inherited, but they\\nmay also occur as a symptom of acquired diseases or as aside effect of certain drugs, including aspirin . Common\\nsymptoms of platelet function disorders include bleedingfrom the nose, mouth, vagina, or anus; pinpoint bruises\\nand purplish patches on the skin; and abnormally heavymenstrual bleeding.\\nDiagnosis\\nIn diagnosing platelet function disorders, specific\\ntests are needed to determine whether the problem iscaused by low numbers of platelets or impaired plateletfunction. A blood platelet count and bleeding time are\\ncommon screening tests.

A pleural biopsy is the removal of pleuraltissue for examination.\\nPurpose\\nPleural biopsy is done to differentiate between\\nbenign and malignant disease, to diagnose viral, fungal,or parasitic diseases, and to identify a condition calledcollagen vascular disease of the pleura. It is also orderedwhen a chest x ray indicates a pleural-based tumor, reac-\\ntion, or thickening of the lining.\\nPrecautions\\nBecause pleural biopsy is an invasive procedure, it is\\nnot recommended for patients with severe bleeding dis-orders.\\nDescription\\nPleural biopsy is usually ordered when pleural fluid\\nobtained by another procedure called thoracentesis\\n(aspiration of pleural fluid) suggests infection, signs ofcancer , or tuberculosis . Pleural biopsies are 85–90%\\naccurate in diagnosing these diseases.\\nThe procedure most often performed for pleural\\nbiopsy is called a percutaneous (passage through the skinby needle puncture) needle biopsy. The procedure takes30–45 minutes, although the biopsy needle itself remainsin the pleura for less than one minute. This type of biop-sy is usually performed by a physician at bedside, if thepatient is hospitalized, or in the doctor’s office underlocal anesthetic.\\nThe actual procedure begins with the patient in a sit-\\nting position, shoulders and arms elevated and supported.The skin overlying the biopsy site is anesthetized and asmall incision is made to allow insertion of the biopsyneedle. This needle is inserted with a cannula (a plasticor metal tube) until fluid is removed. Then the inner nee-dle is removed and a trocar (an instrument for withdraw-ing fluid from a cavity) is inserted to obtain the actualbiopsy specimen. As many as three separate specimensare taken from different sites during the procedure. Thesespecimens are then placed into a fixative solution andsent to the laboratory for tissue (histologic) examination.\\nPreparation\\nPreparations for this procedure vary, depending on\\nthe type of procedure requested.

Flores\\nPleural effusion\\nDefinition\\nPleural effusion occurs when too much fluid collects\\nin the pleural space (the space between the two layers ofthe pleura). It is commonly known as “water on thelungs.” It is characterized by shortness of breath , chest\\npain , gastric discomfort ( dyspepsia ), and cough .\\nDescription\\nThere are two thin membranes in the chest, one (the\\nvisceral pleura) lining the lungs, and the other (the parietalpleura) covering the inside of the chest wall. Normally,small blood vessels in the pleural linings produce a smallamount of fluid that lubricates the opposed pleural mem-branes so that they can glide smoothly against one anotherduring breathing movements. Any extra fluid is taken upby blood and lymph vessels, maintaining a balance. Wheneither too much fluid forms or something prevents itsremoval, the result is an excess of pleural fluid—an effu-sion. The most common causes are disease of the heart orlungs, and inflammation or infection of the pleura.\\nPleural effusion itself is not a disease as much as a\\nresult of many different diseases. For this reason, there isno “typical” patient in terms of age, sex, or other charac-teristics. Instead, anyone who develops one of the manyconditions that can produce an effusion may be affected.\\nThere are two types of pleural effusion: the transu-\\ndate and the exudate. This is a very important pointbecause the two types of fluid are very different, andwhich type is present points to what sort of disease islikely to have produced the effusion. It also can suggestthe best approach to treatment.\\nTransudates\\nA transudate is a clear fluid, similar to blood serum,\\nthat forms not because the pleural surfaces themselvesare diseased, but because the forces that normally pro-duce and remove pleural fluid at the same rate are out ofbalance. When the heart fails, pressure in the small bloodvessels that remove pleural fluid is increased and fluid“backs up” in the pleural space, forming an effusion. Or,if too little protein is present in the blood, the vessels areless able to hold the fluid part of blood within them and itleaks out into the pleural space. This can result from dis-ease of the liver or kidneys, or from malnutrition .\\nExudates\\nAn exudate—which often is a cloudy fluid, contain-\\ning cells and much protein—results from disease of thepleura itself. The causes are many and varied. Among themost common are infections such as bacterial pneumo-\\nniaand tuberculosis ; blood clots in the lungs; and con-\\nnective tissue diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis .\\nCancer and disease in organs such as the pancreas also\\nmay give rise to an exudative pleural effusion.\\nSpecial types of pleural effusion\\nSome of the pleural disorders that produce an exu-\\ndate also cause bleeding into the pleural space. If theeffusion contains half or more of the number of red bloodcells present in the blood itself, it is called hemothorax.When a pleural effusion has a milky appearance and con-tains a large amount of fat, it is called chylothorax.Lymph fluid that drains from tissues throughout the bodyinto small lymph vessels finally collects in a large duct(the thoracic duct) running through the chest to emptyinto a major vein. When this fluid, or chyle, leaks out ofthe duct into the pleural space, chylothorax is the result.Cancer in the chest is a common cause.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses of transudative pleural effusion\\nAmong the most important specific causes of a tran-\\nsudative pleural effusion are:\\n• Congestive heart failure . This causes pleural effusions\\nin about 40% of patients and is often present on bothsides of the chest. Heart failure is the most commoncause of bilateral (two-sided) effusion. When only one\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2628Pleural effusion'),\n",

This is an inflammation of the pericardi-\\num, the membrane covering the heart.\\n• Too much fluid in the body tissues, which spills over\\ninto the pleural space. This is seen in some forms ofkidney disease; when patients have bowel disease andabsorb too little of what they eat; and when an exces-sive amount of fluid is given intravenously.\\n• Liver disease. About 5% of patients with a chronic scar-\\nring disease of the liver called cirrhosis develop pleural\\neffusion.\\nCauses of exudative pleural effusions\\nA wide range of conditions may be the cause of an\\nexudative pleural effusion:\\n• Pleural tumors account for up to 40% of one-sided\\npleural effusions. They may arise in the pleura itself(mesothelioma), or from other sites, notably the lung.\\n• Tuberculosis in the lungs may produce a long-lasting\\nexudative pleural effusion.\\n• Pneumonia affects about three million persons each\\nyear, and four of every ten patients will develop pleuraleffusion. If effective treatment is not provided, an exten-sive effusion can form that is very difficult to treat.\\n• Patients with any of a wide range of infections by a\\nvirus, fungus, or parasite that involve the lungs mayhave pleural effusion.\\n• Up to half of all patients who develop blood clots in their\\nlungs ( pulmonary embolism ) will have pleural effusion,\\nand this sometimes is the only sign of embolism .\\n• Connective tissue diseases, including rheumatoid\\narthritis, lupus, and Sjögren’s syndrome may be com-\\nplicated by pleural effusion.\\n• Patients with disease of the liver or pancreas may have\\nan exudative effusion, and the same is true for anypatient who undergoes extensive abdominal surgery.About 30% of patients who undergo heart surgery willdevelop an effusion.\\n• Injury to the chest may produce pleural effusion in the\\nform of either hemothorax or chylothorax.\\nSymptoms\\nThe key symptom of a pleural effusion is shortness\\nof breath. Fluid filling the pleural space makes it hardfor the lungs to fully expand, causing the patient to takemany breaths so as to get enough oxygen. When theparietal pleura is irritated, the patient may have mildpain that quickly passes or, sometimes, a sharp, stabbingpleuritic type of pain. Some patients will have a dry\\ncough. Occasionally a patient will have no symptoms atall. This is more likely when the effusion results fromrecent abdominal surgery, cancer, or tuberculosis. Tap-ping on the chest will show that the usual crisp soundshave become dull, and on listening with a stethoscopethe normal breath sounds are muted. If the pleura isinflamed, there may be a scratchy sound called a “pleur-al friction rub.”\\nDiagnosis\\nWhen pleural effusion is suspected, the best way\\nto confirm it is to take chest x rays, both straight-onand from the side. The fluid itself can be seen at thebottom of the lung or lungs, hiding the normal lungstructure. If heart failure is present, the x-ray shadowof the heart will be enlarged. An ultrasound scan maydisclose a small effusion that caused no abnormalfindings during chest examination. A computedtomography scan is very helpful if the lungs them-selves are diseased.\\nIn order to learn what has caused the effusion, a nee-\\ndle or catheter is often used to obtain a fluid sample,which is examined for cells and its chemical make-up.This procedure, called a thoracentesis , is the way to\\ndetermine whether an effusion is a transudate or exudate,giving a clue as to the underlying cause. In some cases—for instance when cancer or bacterial infection ispresent—the specific cause can be determined and thecorrect treatment planned. Culturing a fluid sample canidentify the bacteria that cause tuberculosis or otherforms of pleural infection. The next diagnostic step is totake a tissue sample, or pleural biopsy , and examine it\\nunder a microscope. If the effusion is caused by lung dis-ease, placing a viewing tube (bronchoscope) through thelarge air passages will allow the examiner to see theabnormal appearance of the lungs.\\nTreatment\\nThe best way to clear up a pleural effusion is to\\ndirect treatment at what is causing it, rather than treatingthe effusion itself. If heart failure is reversed or a lunginfection is cured by antibiotics , the effusion will usual-\\nly resolve. However, if the cause is not known, even afterextensive tests, or no effective treatment is at hand, thefluid can be drained away by placing a large-bore needleor catheter into the pleural space, just as in diagnosticthoracentesis. If necessary, this can be repeated as oftenas is needed to control the amount of fluid in the pleuralspace. If large effusions continue to recur, a drug ormaterial that irritates the pleural membranes can beinjected to deliberately inflame them and cause them to\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2629Pleural effusion'),\n",

This\\nwill prevent further effusion by eliminating the pleuralspace. In the most severe cases, open surgery withremoval of a rib may be necessary to drain all the fluidand close the pleural space.\\nPrognosis\\nWhen the cause of pleural effusion can be deter-\\nmined and effectively treated, the effusion itself willreliably clear up and should not recur. In many othercases, sclerosis will prevent sizable effusions fromrecurring. Whenever a large effusion causes a patientto be short of breath, thoracentesis will make breathingeasier, and it may be repeated if necessary. To a greatextent, the outlook for patients with pleural effusiondepends on the primary cause of effusion and whetherit can be eliminated. Some forms of pleural effusion,such as that seen after abdominal surgery, are onlytemporary and will clear without specific treatment. Ifheart failure can be controlled, the patient will remainfree of pleural effusion. If, on the other hand, effusionis caused by cancer that cannot be controlled, othereffects of the disease probably will become moreimportant.\\nPrevention\\nBecause pleural effusion is a secondary effect of\\nmany different conditions, the key to preventing it is toKEY TERMS\\nCulture —A test that exposes a sample of body fluid\\nor tissue to special material to see whether bacteriaor another type of microorganism is present.\\nDyspepsia —A vague feeling of being too full and\\nhaving heartburn, bloating, and nausea.

Inflamma-tion occurs when an infection or damaging agent irritatesthe pleural surface. As a consequence, sharp chest painsare the primary symptom of pleurisy.\\nDescription\\nPleurisy, also called pleuritis, is a condition that gen-\\nerally stems from an existing respiratory infection, dis-ease, or injury. In people who have otherwise goodhealth, respiratory infections or pneumonia are the main\\ncauses of pleurisy. This condition used to be more com-mon, but with the advent of antibiotics and modern dis-\\nease therapies, pleurisy has become less prevalent.\\nThe pleura is a double-layered structure made up of\\nan inner membrane, which surrounds the lungs, and anouter membrane, which lines the chest cavity. The pleur-al membranes are very thin, close together, and have afluid coating in the narrow space between them. This liq-uid acts as a lubricant, so that when the lungs inflate anddeflate during breathing, the pleural surfaces can easilyglide over one another.\\nPleurisy occurs when the pleural surfaces rub\\nagainst one another, due to irritation and inflammation.Infection within the pleural space is the most commonirritant, although the abnormal presence of air, blood, orcells can also initiate pleurisy. These disturbances all actto displace the normal pleural fluid, which forces themembranes to rub, rather than glide, against one another.This rubbing irritates nerve endings in the outer mem-brane and causes pain . Pleurisy also causes a chest noise\\nthat ranges from a faint squeak to a loud creak. This char-acteristic sound is called a “friction rub.”\\nPleurisy cases are classified either as having pleural\\neffusion or as being “dry.” Pleural effusion is more com-\\nmon and refers to an accumulation of fluid within thepleural space; dry pleurisy is inflammation without fluidbuild-up. Less pain occurs with pleural effusion becausethe fluid forces the membrane surfaces apart. However,pleural effusion causes additional complications becauseit places pressure on the lungs. This leads to respiratorydistress and possible lung collapse.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA variety of conditions can give rise to pleurisy. The\\nfollowing list represents the most common sources ofpleural inflammation.• infections, including pneumonia, tuberculosis , and\\nother bacterial or viral respiratory infections\\n• immune disorders, including systemic lupus erythe-\\nmatosus ,rheumatoid arthritis , and sarcoidosis\\n• diseases, including cancer ,pancreatitis , liver cirrho-\\nsis, and heart or kidney failure\\n• injury, from a rib fracture, collapsed lung, esophagus\\nrupture, blood clot, or material such as asbestos\\n• drug reactions, from certain drugs used to treat tubercu-\\nlosis (isoniazid), cancer (methotrexate, procarbazine),or the immune disorders mentioned above (hydralazine,procainamide, phenytoin, quinidine)\\nSymptomatic pain\\nThe hallmark symptom of pleurisy is sudden,\\nintense chest pain that is usually located over the area ofinflammation. Although the pain can be constant, it isusually most severe when the lungs move during breath-ing, coughing, sneezing, or even talking. The pain is usu-ally described as shooting or stabbing, but in minor casesit resembles a mild cramp. When pleurisy occurs in cer-tain locations, such as near the diaphragm, the pain maybe felt in other areas such as the neck, shoulder, orabdomen (referred pain). Another indication of pleurisyis that holding one’s breath or exerting pressure againstthe chest causes pain relief.\\nBreathing difficulties\\nPleurisy is also characterized by certain respiratory\\nsymptoms. In response to the pain, pleurisy patientscommonly have a rapid, shallow breathing pattern. Pleur-al effusion can also cause shortness of breath , as excess\\nfluid makes expanding the lungs difficult. If severebreathing difficulties persist, patients may experience ablue colored complexion ( cyanosis ).\\nAdditional symptoms of pleurisy are specific to the\\nillness that triggers the condition. Thus, if infection is thecause, then chills, fever , and fatigue will be likely\\npleurisy symptoms.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe distinctive pain of pleurisy is normally the first\\nclue physicians use for diagnosis. Doctors usually feelthe chest to find the most painful area, which is the likelysite of inflammation. A stethoscope is also used to listenfor abnormal chest sounds as the patient breathes. If thedoctor hears the characteristic friction rub, the diagnosisof pleurisy can be confirmed. Sometimes, a friction rubis masked by the presence of pleural effusion and furtherexamination is needed for an accurate diagnosis.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2631Pleurisy'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 338}, page_content='Identifying the actual illness that causes pleurisy is\\nmore difficult. To make this diagnosis, doctors must eval-uate the patient’s history, additional symptoms, and labo-ratory test results. A chest x ray may also be taken to\\nlook for signs of accumulated fluid and other abnormali-ties. Possible causes, such as pneumonia, fractured ribs,esophagus rupture, and lung tumors may be detected onan x ray. Computed tomography scan (CT scan) andultrasound scans are more powerful diagnostic tools usedto visualize the chest cavity. Images from these tech-niques more clearly pinpoint the location of excess fluidor other suspected problems.\\nThe most helpful information in diagnosing the\\ncause of pleurisy is a fluid analysis. Once the doctorknows the precise location of fluid accumulation, a sam-ple is removed using a procedure called thoracentesis .\\nIn this technique, a fine needle is inserted into the chestto reach the pleural space and extract fluid. The fluid’sappearance and composition is thoroughly examined tohelp doctors understand how the fluid was produced.Several laboratory tests are performed to analyze thechemical components of the fluid. These tests also deter-mine whether infection-causing bacteria or viruses arepresent. In addition, cells within the fluid are identifiedand counted. Cancerous cells can also be detected tolearn whether the pleurisy is caused by a malignancy.\\nIn certain instances, such as dry pleurisy, or when a\\nfluid analysis is not informative, a biopsy of the pleuramay be needed for microscopic analysis. A sample ofpleural tissue can be obtained several ways: with a biop-sy needle, by making a small incision in the chest wall,or by using a thoracoscope (a video-assisted instrumentfor viewing the pleural space and collecting samples).\\nTreatment\\nPain management\\nThe pain of pleurisy is usually treated with analgesic\\nand anti-inflammatory drugs, such as acetaminophen ,\\nibuprofen, and indomethacin. People with pleurisy mayalso receive relief from lying on the painful side. Some-times, a painful cough will be controlled with codeine-\\nbased cough syrups. However, as the pain eases, a personwith pleurisy should try to breathe deeply and cough toclear any congestion, otherwise pneumonia may occur.Rest is also important to aid in the recovery process.\\nTreating the source\\nThe treatment used to cure pleurisy is ultimately\\ndefined by the underlying cause. Thus, pleurisy from abacterial infection can be successfully treated withantibiotics, while no treatment is given for viral infec-tions that must run their course. Specific therapies\\ndesigned for more chronic illnesses can often causepleurisy to subside. For example, tuberculosis pleurisy istreated with standard anti-tuberculosis drugs. With someillnesses, excess fluid continues to accumulate and caus-es severe respiratory distress. In these individuals, thefluid may be removed by thoracentesis, or the doctormay insert a chest tube to drain large amounts. If leftuntreated, a more serious infection may develop withinthe fluid, called empyema .\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments can be used in conjunction\\nwith conventional treatment to help heal pleurisy.Acupuncture and botanical medicines are alternative\\napproaches for alleviating pleural pain and breathing prob-lems. An herbal remedy commonly recommended ispleurisy root ( Asclepias tuberosa ), so named because of its\\nuse by early American settlers who learned of this medici-nal plant from Native Americans. Pleurisy root helps toease pain, inflammation, and breathing difficulties broughton by pleurisy. This herb is often used in conjunction withmullein ( Verbascum thapsus ) or elecampane ( Inula heleni-\\num), which serve as expectorants to clear excess mucus\\nfrom the lungs. In addition, there are many other respirato-ry herbs that are used as expectorants or for other actionson the respiratory system. Herbs thought to combat infec-tion, such as echinacea (Echinacea spp.) are also included\\nin herbal pleurisy remedies. Anitviral herbs, such asLomatium dissectum and Ligusticum porteri , can be used\\nif the pleurisy is of viral origin. Traditional Chinese\\nmedicine uses the herb ephedra ( Ephedra sinica ), which\\nacts to open air passages and alleviate respiratory difficul-ties in pleurisy patients. Dietary recommendations includeeating fresh fruits and vegetables, adequate protein, andgood quality fats (omega–3 fatty acids are anti-inflamma-tory and are found in fish and flax oil). Taking certainnutritional supplements, especially large doeses of vitaminC, may also provide health benefits to people withpleurisy. Contrast hydrotherapy applied to the chest and\\nback, along with compresses (cloths soaked in an herbalsolution) or poultices (crushed herbs applied directly tothe skin) of respiratory herbs, can assist in the healingprocess. Homeopathic treatment, guided by a trained prac-titioner, can be effective in resolving pleurisy.\\nPrognosis\\nPrompt diagnosis, followed by appropriate treat-\\nment, ensures a good recovery for most pleurisy patients.Generally speaking, the prognosis for pleurisy is linkedto the seriousness of its cause. Therefore, the outcome ofpleurisy caused by a disease such as cancer will varydepending on the type and location of the tumor.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2632Pleurisy'),\n",

It is caused bythe bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae .\\nDescription\\nThe gram-positive, spherical bacteria, Streptococcus\\npneumoniae , is the cause of many human diseases,\\nincluding pneumonia. Although the bacteria can normal-ly be found in the nose and throat of healthy individuals,it can grow and cause infection when the immune systemis weakened. Infection usually begins with the upper res-piratory tract and then travels into the lungs. Pneumoniaoccurs when the bacteria find their way deep into thelungs, to the area called the alveoli, or air sacs. This is thefunctional part of the lungs where oxygen is absorbedinto the blood. Once in the alveoli, Streptococcus pneu-\\nmoniae begin to grow and multiply. White blood cells\\nand immune proteins from the blood also accumulate atthe site of infection in the alveoli. As the alveoli fill withthese substances and fluid, they can no longer function inthe exchange of oxygen. This fluid filling of the lungs ishow pneumonia is defined.\\nThose people most at risk of developing pneumo-\\ncoccal pneumonia have a weakened immune system.This includes the elderly, infants, cancer patients, AIDS\\npatients, post-operative patients, alcoholics, and thosewith diabetes. Pneumococcal pneumonia is a disease thathas a high rate of hospital transmission, putting hospitalpatients at greater risk. Prior lung infections also makessomeone more likely to develop pneumococcal pneumo-nia. The disease can be most severe in patients who havehad their spleen removed. It is the spleen that is responsi-ble for removing the bacteria from the blood. Cases ofpneumonia, which is spread by close contact, seem tooccur most often between November through April.

Symp-\\ntoms often have an abrupt beginning and occur after anupper respiratory infection such as a cold. Symptomsmay differ somewhat in the elderly, with minimal cough,no sputum and no fever, but rather tiredness and confu-sion leading to hypothermia and shock .\\nDiagnosis\\nThe presence of symptoms and a physical exam that\\nreveals abnormal lung sounds usually suggest the pres-ence of pneumonia. Diagnosis is typically made from anx ray of the lungs, which indicates the accumulation offluid. Additional tests that may be done include a com-plete blood count , a sputum sample for microscopic\\nexamination and culture for Streptococcus pneumoniae ,\\nand possibly blood cultures.\\nTreatment\\nDepending on the severity of the disease, antibi-\\notics are given either at home or in the hospital. Histori-\\ncally, the treatment for pneumococcal pneumonia hasbeen penicillin. An increasing number of cases of pneu-mococcal pneumonia have become partially or com-pletely resistant to penicillin, making it less effective intreating this disease. Other effective antibiotics includeamoxicillin and erythromycin. If these antibiotics arenot effective, vancomycin or cephalosporin may alterna-tively be used.\\nSymptoms associated with pneumococcal pneumo-\\nnia can also be treated. For instance, fever can be treatedwith aspirin or acetaminophen . Supplemental oxygen\\nand intravenous fluids may help. Patients are advised toget plenty of rest and take increased amounts of fluids.Coughing should be promoted because it helps to clearthe lungs of fluid.\\nAlternative treatment\\nBeing a serious, sometimes fatal disease, pneumo-\\ncoccal pneumonia is best treated as soon as possiblewith antibiotics. However, there are alternative treat-ments that both support this conventional treatment andprevent recurrences. Maintaining a healthy immune sys-tem is important. One way to do this is by taking theherb, echinacea (Echinacea spp.). Getting plenty of restand reducing stress can help the body heal. Some practi-\\ntioners feel that mucus-producing foods (including dairyproducts, eggs, gluten-rich grains such as wheat, oats,rye, as well as sugar) can contribute to the lung conges-tion that accompanies pneumonia. Decreasing thesefoods and increasing the amount of fresh fruits and veg-etables may help to decrease lung congestion. Adequateprotein in the diet is also essential for the body to pro-duce antibodies. Contrast and constitutional hydrother-\\napycan be very helpful in treating cases of pneumonia.\\nOther alternative therapies, including acupuncture ,\\nChinese herbal medicine, and homeopathy , can be very\\nuseful during the recovery phase, helping the body torebuild after the illness and contributing to the preven-tion of recurrences.\\nPrognosis\\nSimple, uncomplicated cases of pneumococcal\\npneumonia will begin to respond to antibiotics in 48 to72 hours. Full recovery from pneumonia, however, isgreatly dependent on the age and overall health of theindividual. Normally, healthy and younger patients canrecover in only a few days, while the elderly or otherwiseweakened individuals may not recover for several weeks.Complications may develop which give a poorer progno-sis. Even when promptly and properly diagnosed, suchweakened patients may die of their pneumonia.\\nPrevention\\nV accination\\nRecently, a vaccination has become available for\\nthe prevention of pneumococcal pneumonia. This vacci-nation is generally recommended for people with a highlikelihood of developing pneumococcal infection or forthose in whom a serious complication of infection is like-ly to develop.

The dis-ease agent is an organism whose biological classificationis still uncertain. Pneumocystis carinii was originally\\nthought to be a one-celled organism (a protozoan), butmore recent research suggests that it is a fungus.Although its life cycle is known to have three stages, itsmethod of reproduction is not yet completely under-stood. The complete name of the disease is Pneumocystis\\ncarinii pneumonia, often shortened to PCP. PCP is also\\nsometimes called pneumocystosis.\\nDescription\\nPneumonia as a general term refers to a severe lung\\ninflammation. In pneumocystis pneumonia, this inflam-mation is caused by the growth of Pneumocystis carinii ,\\na fungus-like organism that is widespread in the environ-ment. PCP is ordinarily a rare disease, affecting onlypeople with weakened immune systems. Many of thesepeople are patients receiving drugs for organ transplantsor cancer treatment. With the rising incidence of AIDS ,\\nhowever, PCP has become primarily associated withAIDS patients. In fact, as many as 75% of AIDS patientshave developed PCP. It has also been the leading cause ofdeath in AIDS patients.\\nTransmission\\nThe organism that causes PCP is widely distributed\\nin nature and is transmitted through the air. When theorganism is inhaled, it enters the upper respiratory tractand infects the tiny air sacs at the ends of the smaller airtubes (bronchioles) in the lungs. These tiny air sacs arecalled alveoli. Under a microscope, alveoli look likegroups of hollow spheres resembling grape clusters. Theexchange of oxygen with the blood takes place in thealveoli. It appears that P . carinii lives in the fluid in the\\nlining of the alveoli.\\nPerson-to-person infection does not appear to be\\nvery common; however, clusters of PCP outbreaks inhospitals and groups of immunocompromised peopleindicate that patients with active PCP should not beexposed to others with weakened immune systems. It isthought that many people actually acquire mild Pneumo-\\ncystis carinii infections from time to time, but are pro-\\ntected by their immune systems from developing a full-blown case of the disease.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2635Pneumocystis pneumonia'),\n",

This means\\nthat it causes disease only under certain conditions, aswhen a person is immunocompromised. Under these cir-cumstances, P . carinii can multiply and cause pneumo-\\nnia. The mechanisms of the organism’s growth within thealveoli are not fully understood. As the pneumocystisorganism continues to replicate, it gradually fills thealveoli. As the pneumonia becomes more severe, fluidaccumulates and tissue scarring occurs. These changesresult in decreased respiratory function and lower levelsof oxygen in the blood.\\nHigh-risk groups\\nSome patients are at greater risk of developing PCP.\\nThese high-risk groups include:\\n• premature infants\\n• patients with immunodeficiency diseases, including\\nsevere combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID)\\nand acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)\\n• patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs, especially\\ncortisone-like drugs ( corticosteroids )\\n• patients with protein malnutrition.\\nAIDS is currently the most common risk factor for\\nPCP in the United States. PCP is, however, also found incountries with widespread hunger and poor hygiene.\\nSymptoms\\nThe incubation period of PCP is not definitely\\nknown, but is thought to be between four and eightweeks. The major symptoms include shortness of\\nbreath ,fever , and a nonproductive cough . Less common\\nsymptoms include production of sputum, blood in thesputum, difficulty breathing, and chest pain . Most\\npatients will have symptoms for one to two weeks beforeseeing a physician. Occasionally, the disease will spreadoutside of the lung to other organs, including the lymphnodes, spleen, liver, or bone marrow.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of PCP begins with a thorough physi-\\ncal examination and blood tests. Although imaging\\nstudies are helpful in identifying abnormal areas in thelungs, the diagnosis of PCP must be confirmed by micro-scopic identification of the organism in the lung. Sam-ples may be taken from the patient’s sputum, or may beobtained via bronchoscopy or lung biopsy . Because of\\nthe severity of the disease, many physicians will proceedto treat patients with symptoms of pneumocystis pneu-\\nmonia if they belong to a high-risk group, without theformality of an actual diagnosis. The severity of PCP canbe measured by x-ray studies and by determining theamount of oxygen and carbon dioxide present in thepatient’s blood.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for PCP involves the use of antibiotics .\\nThese include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX, Bactrim, Septra) and pentamidine isoethionate(Nebupent, Pentam 300). Both of these anti-microbialdrugs are equally effective. AIDS patients are typicallytreated for 21 days, whereas non-AIDS patients are treat-ed for 14 days. TMP-SMX may be highly toxic in AIDSpatients, causing severe side effects that include fever,rash, decreased numbers of white blood cells andplatelets, and hepatitis. Pentamidine also causes sideeffects in immunocompromised patients. These sideeffects include decreased blood pressure, irregular heartbeats, the accumulation of nitrogenous waste products inthe blood (azotemia), and electrolyte imbalances. Pen-tamidine can be given in aerosol form to minimize sideeffects. Alternative drugs can be used for patients experi-encing these side effects.\\nP . carinii appears to be developing resistance to\\nTMP-SMX. In addition, some patients are allergic to thestandard antibiotics given for PCP. As a result, otherantibiotics for the treatment of PCP are continually underinvestigation. Some drugs proven to be effective againstP . carinii include dapsone (DDS) with trimethoprim\\n(Trimpex), clindamycin (Cleocin) with primaquine, aswell as atovaquone (Mepron). Paradoxically, corticos-teroids have been found to improve the ability of TMP-SMX or pentamidine to treat PCP. As a treatment of lastresort, trimetrexate with leucovorin (Wellcovorin) canalso be used.\\nPrognosis\\nIf left untreated, PCP will cause breathing difficulties\\nthat will eventually cause death. The prognosis for thisdisease depends on the amount of damage to the patient’slungs prior to treatment. Prognosis is usually better at afacility that specializes in caring for AIDS patients.Antibiotic treatment of PCP is about 80% effective.\\nPrevention\\nMedications\\nFor patients at serious risk for PCP infection, low\\ndoses of TMP-SMX, given daily or three times a week,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2636Pneumocystis pneumonia'),\n",

Jones, PhD\\nPneumonectomy seeLung surgery\\nPneumonia\\nDefinition\\nPneumonia is an infection of the lung, and can be\\ncaused by nearly any class of organism known to causehuman infections. These include bacteria, viruses, fungi,and parasites. In the United States, pneumonia is the sixthmost common disease leading to death . It is also the most\\ncommon fatal infection acquired by already hospitalizedpatients. In developing countries, pneumonia ties withdiarrhea as the most common cause of death.\\nDescription\\nAnatomy of the lung\\nTo better understand pneumonia, it is important to\\nunderstand the basic anatomic features of the respiratorysystem. The human respiratory system begins at the noseand mouth, where air is breathed in (inspired) and out(expired). The air tube extending from the nose is calledthe nasopharynx. The tube carrying air breathed in throughthe mouth is called the oropharynx. The nasopharynx andthe oropharynx merge into the larynx. The oropharynxalso carries swallowed substances, including food, water,and salivary secretion, which must pass into the esophagusand then the stomach. The larynx is protected by a trapdoor called the epiglottis. The epiglottis prevents sub-stances that have been swallowed, as well as substancesthat have been regurgitated (thrown up), from headingdown into the larynx and toward the lungs.\\nA useful method of picturing the respiratory system\\nis to imagine an upside-down tree. The larynx flows intothe trachea, which is the tree trunk, and thus the broadest\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2637Pneumonia'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 344}, page_content='part of the respiratory tree. The trachea divides into two\\ntree limbs, the right and left bronchi. Each one of thesebranches off into multiple smaller bronchi, which coursethrough the tissue of the lung. Each bronchus dividesinto tubes of smaller and smaller diameter, finally endingin the terminal bronchioles. The air sacs of the lung, inwhich oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange actually takesplace, are clustered at the ends of the bronchioles like theleaves of a tree. They are called alveoli.\\nThe tissue of the lung which serves only a support-\\nive role for the bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli is calledthe lung parenchyma.\\nFunction of the respiratory system\\nThe main function of the respiratory system is to pro-\\nvide oxygen, the most important energy source for thebody’s cells. Inspired air (the air you breath in) containsthe oxygen, and travels down the respiratory tree to thealveoli. The oxygen moves out of the alveoli and is sentinto circulation throughout the body as part of the redblood cells. The oxygen in the inspired air is exchangedwithin the alveoli for the waste product of human metabo-lism, carbon dioxide. The air you breathe out contains thegas called carbon dioxide. This gas leaves the alveoli dur-ing expiration. To restate this exchange of gases simply,you breathe in oxygen, you breathe out carbon dioxide\\nRespiratory system defenses\\nThe normal, healthy human lung is sterile. There are\\nno normally resident bacteria or viruses (unlike the upperrespiratory system and parts of the gastrointestinal sys-tem, where bacteria dwell even in a healthy state). Thereare multiple safeguards along the path of the respiratorysystem. These are designed to keep invading organismsfrom leading to infection.\\nThe first line of defense includes the hair in the nos-\\ntrils, which serves as a filter for larger particles. Theepiglottis is a trap door of sorts, designed to prevent foodand other swallowed substances from entering the larynxand then trachea. Sneezing and coughing, both provokedby the presence of irritants within the respiratory system,help to clear such irritants from the respiratory tract.\\nMucous, produced through the respiratory system,\\nalso serves to trap dust and infectious organisms. Tiny hairlike projections (cilia) from cells lining the respiratorytract beat constantly. They move debris trapped by mucusupwards and out of the respiratory tract. This mechanismof protection is referred to as the mucociliary escalator.\\nCells lining the respiratory tract produce several\\ntypes of immune substances which protect against vari-ous organisms. Other cells (called macrophages) alongthe respiratory tract actually ingest and kill invading\\norganisms.\\nThe organisms that cause pneumonia, then, are usu-\\nally carefully kept from entering the lungs by virtue ofthese host defenses. However, when an individualencounters a large number of organisms at once, theusual defenses may be overwhelmed, and infection mayoccur. This can happen either by inhaling contaminatedair droplets, or by aspiration of organisms inhabiting theupper airways.\\nConditions predisposing to pneumonia\\nIn addition to exposure to sufficient quantities of\\ncausative organisms, certain conditions may make anindividual more likely to become ill with pneumonia.Certainly, the lack of normal anatomical structure couldresult in an increased risk of pneumonia. For example,there are certain inherited defects of cilia which result inless effective protection. Cigarette smoke, inhaled direct-ly by a smoker or second-hand by a innocent bystander,interferes significantly with ciliary function, as well asinhibiting macrophage function.\\nStroke , seizures, alcohol, and various drugs inter-\\nfere with the function of the epiglottis. This leads to aleaky seal on the trap door, with possible contaminationby swallowed substances and/or regurgitated stomachcontents. Alcohol and drugs also interfere with the nor-mal cough reflex. This further decreases the chance of\\nclearing unwanted debris from the respiratory tract.\\nViruses may interfere with ciliary function, allowing\\nthemselves or other microorganism invaders (such asbacteria) access to the lower respiratory tract. One of themost important viruses is HIV (Human Immunodefi-\\nciency Virus), the causative virus in AIDS (acquired\\nimmunodeficiency syndrome). In recent years this virushas resulted in a huge increase in the incidence of pneu-monia. Because AIDS results in a general decreasedeffectiveness of many aspects of the host’s immune sys-tem, a patient with AIDS is susceptible to all kinds ofpneumonia. This includes some previously rare parasitictypes which would be unable to cause illness in an indi-vidual possessing a normal immune system.\\nThe elderly have a less effective mucociliary escala-\\ntor, as well as changes in their immune system. Thiscauses this age group to be more at risk for the develop-ment of pneumonia.\\nVarious chronic conditions predispose a person to\\ninfection with pneumonia. These include asthma ,cystic\\nfibrosis , and neuromuscular diseases which may inter-\\nfere with the seal of the epiglottis. Esophageal disordersmay result in stomach contents passing upwards into the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2638Pneumonia'),\n",

This increases the risk of aspiration into the\\nlungs of those stomach contents with their resident bacte-ria. Diabetes, sickle cell anemia, lymphoma, leukemia,and emphysema also predispose a person to pneumonia.\\nPneumonia is also one of the most frequent infec-\\ntious complications of all types of surgery. Many drugsused during and after surgery may increase the risk ofaspiration, impair the cough reflex, and cause a patient tounderfill their lungs with air. Pain after surgery also dis-\\ncourages a patient from breathing deeply enough, andfrom coughing effectively.\\nCauses\\nThe list of organisms which can cause pneumonia is\\nvery large, and includes nearly every class of infectingorganism: viruses, bacteria, bacteria-like organisms,fungi, and parasites (including certain worms). Differentorganisms are more frequently encountered by differentage groups. Further, other characteristics of an individualmay place him or her at greater risk for infection by par-ticular types of organisms:\\n• Viruses cause the majority of pneumonias in young\\nchildren (especially respiratory syncytial virus, parain-fluenza and influenza viruses, and adenovirus).\\n• Adults are more frequently infected with bacteria (such\\nas Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,\\nand Staphylococcus aureus ).\\n• Pneumonia in older children and young adults is often\\ncaused by the bacteria-like Mycoplasma pneumoniae\\n(the cause of what is often referred to as “walking”pneumonia).\\n•Pneumocystis carinii is an extremely important cause\\nof pneumonia in patients with immune problems (suchas patients being treated for cancer with chemothera-\\npy, or patients with AIDS. Classically considered a par-\\nasite, it appears to be more related to fungi.\\n• People who have reason to come into contact with bird\\ndroppings, such as poultry workers, are at risk for pneu-monia caused by the organism Chlamydia psittaci.\\n• A very large, serious outbreak of pneumonia occurred\\nin 1976, when many people attending an AmericanLegion convention were infected by a previouslyunknown organism. Subsequently named Legionella\\npneumophila, it causes what is now called “Legion-\\nnaire’s disease.” The organism was traced to air condi-tioning units in the convention’s hotel.\\nSymptoms\\nPneumonia is suspected in any patient who has fever ,\\ncough, chest pain, shortness of breath , and increasedrespirations (number of breaths per minute). Fever with a\\nshaking chill is even more suspicious. Many patientscough up clumps of sputum, commonly known as spit.These secretions are produced in the alveoli during aninfection or other inflammatory condition. They mayappear streaked with pus or blood. Severe pneumoniaresults in the signs of oxygen deprivation. This includesblue appearance of the nail beds or lips ( cyanosis ).\\nThe invading organism causes symptoms, in part, by\\nprovoking an overly-strong immune response in thelungs. In other words, the immune system, which shouldhelp fight off infections, kicks into such high gear, that itdamages the lung tissue and makes it more susceptible toinfection. The small blood vessels in the lungs (capillar-ies) become leaky, and protein-rich fluid seeps into thealveoli. This results in less functional area for oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange. The patient becomes relatively\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2639Pneumonia\\nA chest x-ray showing lobar pneumonia in the lower lobe of\\na patient’s right lung.

Mucus plugsactually further decrease the efficiency of gas exchangein the lung. The alveoli fill further with fluid and debrisfrom the large number of white blood cells being pro-duced to fight the infection.\\nConsolidation, a feature of bacterial pneumonias,\\noccurs when the alveoli, which are normally hollow airspaces within the lung, instead become solid, due toquantities of fluid and debris.\\nViral pneumonias and mycoplasma pneumonias, do\\nnot result in consolidation. These types of pneumoniaprimarily infect the walls of the alveoli and the parenchy-ma of the lung.\\nDiagnosis\\nFor the most part, diagnosis is based on the patient’s\\nreport of symptoms, combined with examination of thechest. Listening with a stethoscope will reveal abnormalsounds, and tapping on the patient’s back (which shouldyield a resonant sound due to air filling the alveoli) mayinstead yield a dull thump if the alveoli are filled withfluid and debris.\\nLaboratory diagnosis can be made of some bacterial\\npneumonias by staining sputum with special chemicalsand looking at it under a microscope. Identification ofthe specific type of bacteria may require culturing thesputum (using the sputum sample to grow greater num-bers of the bacteria in a lab dish.).\\nX-ray examination of the chest may reveal certain\\nabnormal changes associated with pneumonia. Localizedshadows obscuring areas of the lung may indicate a bacte-rial pneumonia, while streaky or patchy appearing changesin the x-ray picture may indicate viral or mycoplasmapneumonia. These changes on x ray, however, are knownto lag in time behind the patient’s actual symptoms.\\nTreatment\\nPrior to the discovery of penicillin antibiotics , bac-\\nterial pneumonia was almost always fatal. Today, antibi-otics, especially given early in the course of the disease,are very effective against bacterial causes of pneumonia.Erythromycin and tetracycline improve recovery time forsymptoms of mycoplasma pneumonia. They, do not,however, eradicate the organisms. Amantadine and acy-clovir may be helpful against certain viral pneumonias.Prognosis\\nPrognosis varies according to the type of organism\\ncausing the infection. Recovery following pneumoniawith Mycoplasma pneumoniae is nearly 100%. Staphylo-\\ncoccus pneumoniae has a death rate of 30–40%. Similar-\\nly, infections with a number of gram negative bacteria(such as those in the gastrointestinal tract which cancause infection following aspiration) have a death rate of25–50%. Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common\\norganism causing pneumonia, produces a death rate ofabout 5%. More complications occur in the very youngor very old individuals who have multiple areas of thelung infected simultaneously. Individuals with otherchronic illnesses (including cirrhosis of the liver, con-\\ngestive heart failure , individuals without a functioning\\nspleen, and individuals who have other diseases thatresult in a weakened immune system, experience compli-cations. Patients with immune disorders, various types ofcancer, transplant patients, and AIDS patients also expe-rience complications.\\nPrevention\\nBecause many bacterial pneumonias occur in\\npatients who are first infected with the influenza virus(the flu), yearly vaccination against influenza can\\ndecrease the risk of pneumonia for certain patients. Thisis particularly true of the elderly and people with chronicdiseases (such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, other lung orheart diseases, sickle cell disease , diabetes, kidney dis-\\nease, and forms of cancer).\\nA specific vaccine against Streptococcus pneumoni-\\naeis very protective, and should also be administered to\\npatients with chronic illnesses.\\nPatients who have decreased immune resistance are\\nat higher risk for infection with Pneumocystis carinii.\\nThey are frequently put on a regular drug regimen ofTrimethoprim sulfa and/or inhaled pentamidine to avoidpneumocystis pneumonia .\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nJohanson, Waldemar G. “Bacterial Meningitis.” In Cecil Text-\\nbook of Medicine , ed.

Pneu-\\nmothorax can be either spontaneous or due to trauma.\\nIf a pneumothorax occurs suddenly or for no known\\nreason, it is called a spontaneous pneumothorax. Thiscondition most often strikes tall, thin men between theages of 20 to 40. In addition, people with lung disorders,such as emphysema ,cystic fibrosis , and tuberculosis ,\\nare at higher risk for spontaneous pneumothorax. Trau-matic pneumothorax is the result of accident or injurydue to medical procedures performed to the chest cavity,such as thoracentesis or mechanical ventilation. Tension\\npneumothorax is a serious and potentially life-threaten-ing condition that may be caused by traumatic injury,chronic lung disease, or as a complication of a medicalprocedure. In this type of pneumothorax, air enters thechest cavity, but cannot escape. This greatly increasedpressure in the pleural space causes the lung to collapsecompletely, compresses the heart, and pushes the heartand associated blood vessels toward the unaffected side.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe symptoms of pneumothrax depend on how\\nmuch air enters the chest, how much the lung collapses,and the extent of lung disease. Symptoms include the fol-lowing, according to the cause of the pneumothorax:\\n• Spontaneous pneumothorax. Simple spontaneous pneu-\\nmothorax is caused by a rupture of a small air sac orfluid-filled sac in the lung. It may be related to activityin otherwise healthy people or may occur during scubadiving or flying at high altitudes. Complicated sponta-neous pneumothorax, also generally caused by ruptureof a small sac in the lung, occurs in people with lungdiseases. The symptoms of complicated spontaneouspneumothorax tend to be worse than those of simplepneumothorax, due to the underlying lung disease.Spontaneous pneumothorax is characterized by dull,sharp, or stabbing chest pain that begins suddenly and\\nbecomes worse with deep breathing or coughing. Othersymptoms are shortness of breath , rapid breathing,\\nabnormal breathing movement (that is, little chest wallmovement when breathing), and cough.\\n• Tension pneumothorax. Following trauma, air may enter\\nthe chest cavity. A penetrating chest wound allows out-side air to enter the chest, causing the lung to collapse.Certain medical procedures performed in the chest cavi-ty, such as thoracentesis, also may cause a lung to col-lapse. Tension pneumothorax may be the immediateresult of an injury; the delayed complication of a hiddeninjury, such as a fractured rib, that punctures the lung; orthe result of lung damage from asthma , chronic bron-\\nchitis , or emphysema.

Bloodsamples may be taken to check for the level of arterialblood gases.\\nTreatment\\nA small pneumothorax may resolve on its own, but\\nmost require medical treatment. The object of treatment isto remove air from the chest and allow the lung to re-expand. This is done by inserting a needle and syringe (ifthe pneumothorax is small) or chest tube through the chestwall. This allows the air to escape without allowing any air\\nback in.

About 10 mil-\\nlion cases of poisoning occur in the United States eachyear. In 80% of the cases, the victim is a child under theage of five. About 50 children die each year from poison-ings. Curiosity, inability to read warning labels, a desireto imitate adults, and inadequate supervision lead tochildhood poisonings.\\nThe elderly are the second most likely group to be\\npoisoned. Mental confusion, poor eyesight, and the useof multiple drugs are the leading reasons why this grouphas a high rate of accidental poisoning. A substantialnumber of poisonings also occur as suicide attempts ordrug overdoses.\\nPoisons are common in the home and workplace, yet\\nthere are basically two major types. One group consistsof products that were never meant to be ingested orinhaled, such as shampoo, paint thinner, pesticides,houseplant leaves, and carbon monoxide. The othergroup contains products that can be ingested in smallquantities, but which are harmful if taken in largeamounts, such as pharmaceuticals, medicinal herbs, oralcohol. Other types of poisons include the bacterial tox-ins that cause food poisoning , such as Escherichia coli ;\\nheavy metals, such as the lead found in the paint on olderhouses; and the venom found in the bites and stings of\\nsome animals and insects. The staff at a poison controlcenter and emergency room doctors have the most expe-rience diagnosing and treating poisoning cases.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe effects of poisons are as varied as the poisons\\nthemselves; however, the exact mechanisms of only afew are understood. Some poisons interfere with themetabolism. Others destroy the liver or kidneys, such asheavy metals and some pain relief medications, includ-\\ning acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-\\ninflammatory drugs (Advil, Ibuprofen). A poison may\\nseverely depress the central nervous system, leading tocoma and eventual respiratory and circulatory failure.\\nPotential poisons in this category include anesthetics(e.g. ether and chloroform), opiates (e.g., morphine andcodeine), and barbiturates . Some poisons directly affect\\nthe respiratory and circulatory system. Carbon monoxidecauses death by binding with hemoglobin that would\\nnormally transport oxygen throughout the body. Certaincorrosive vapors trigger the body to flood the lungs withfluids, effectively drowning the person. Cyanide inter-feres with respiration at the cellular level. Another groupof poisons interferes with the electrochemical impulsesthat travel between neurons in the nervous system. Yetanother group, including cocaine , ergot, strychnine, and\\nsome snake venoms, causes potentially fatal seizures.\\nSeverity of symptoms can range from headache and\\nnausea to convulsions and death. The type of poison, theamount and time of exposure, and the age, size, andhealth of the victim are all factors which determine theseverity of symptoms and the chances for recovery.\\nPlant poisoning\\nThere are more than 700 species of poisonous plants\\nin the United States. Plants are second only to medicinesin causing serious poisoning in children under age five.There is no way to tell by looking at a plant if it is poiso-nous. Some plants, such as the yew shrub, are almostentirely toxic: needles, bark, seeds, and berries. In otherplants, only certain parts are poisonous. The bulb of thehyacinth and daffodil are toxic, but the flowers are not;while the flowers of the jasmine plant are the poisonouspart. Moreover, some plants are confusing because por-tions of them are eaten as food while other parts are poiso-nous. For example, the fleshy stem (tuber) of the potatoplant is nutritious; however, its roots, sprouts, and vinesare poisonous. The leaves of tomatoes are poisonous,while the fruit is not. Rhubarb stalks are good to eat, butthe leaves are poisonous. Apricots, cherries, peaches, andapples all produce healthful fruit, but their seeds contain aform of cyanide that can kill a child if chewed in sufficientquantities. One hundred milligrams (mg) of moist, crushedapricot seeds can produce 217 mg of cyanide.\\nCommon houseplants that contain some poisonous\\nparts include:\\n• Aloe\\n• Amaryllis\\n• Cyclamen\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2643Poisoning'),\n",

It is often difficult to tell if a personhas eaten a poisonous plant because there are no tell-taleempty containers and no unusual lesions or odors aroundthe mouth.\\nHousehold chemicals\\nMany products used daily in the home are poisonous\\nif swallowed. These products often contain strong acidsor strong bases (alkalis). Toxic household cleaning prod-ucts include:\\n• ammonia\\n• bleach\\n• dishwashing liquids• drain openers\\n• floor waxes and furniture polishes\\n• laundry detergents, spot cleaners, and fabric softeners\\n• mildew removers\\n• oven cleaners\\n• toilet bowl cleaners\\nPersonal care products found in the home can also\\nbe poisonous. These include:\\n• deodorant\\n• hairspray\\n• hair straighteners• nail polish and polish remover\\n• perfume\\n• shampoo\\nSigns that a person has swallowed one of these sub-\\nstances include evidence of an empty container nearby,nausea or vomiting, and burns on the lips and skin\\naround the mouth if the substance was a strong acid oralkali.

However,when taken in large quantities, or with other drugs wherethere may be an adverse interaction, they can act as poi-sons. Drug overdoses, both accidental and intentional,are the leading cause of poisoning in adults. Medicinalherbs should be treated like pharmaceuticals and takenonly in designated quantities under the supervision of aknowledgeable person. Herbs that have healing qualitieswhen taken in small doses can be toxic in larger doses.\\nDrug overdoses cause a range of symptoms, including\\nexcitability, sleepiness, confusion, unconsciousness, rapidheartbeat, convulsions, nausea, and changes in blood pres-sure. The best initial evidence of a drug overdose is the\\npresence of an empty container near the victim.\\nOther causes of poisonings\\nPeople can be poisoned by fumes they inhale. Car-\\nbon monoxide is the most common form of inhaled poi-son.

Evidence of an empty container or informa-tion from the victim are helpful in determining exactlywhat substance has caused the poisoning. Some acidsand alkalis leave burns on the mouth. Petroleum prod-ucts, such as lighter fluid or kerosene, leave a distinctiveodor on the breath. The vomit may be tested to determinethe exact composition of the poison. Once hospitalized,blood and urine tests may be done on the patient to deter-mine his metabolic condition.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for poisoning depends on the poison swal-\\nlowed or inhaled. Contacting the poison control center orhospital emergency room is the first step in getting propertreatment. The poison control center’s telephone numberis often listed with emergency numbers on the insidecover of the telephone book, or it can be reached by dial-ing the operator. The poison control center will ask forspecific information about the victim and the poison, thengive appropriate first aid instructions. If the patient is tobe taken to a hospital, a sample of vomit and the poisoncontainer should be taken along, if they are available.\\nMost cases of plant poisoning are treated by induc-\\ning vomiting, if the patient is fully conscious. V omitingcan be induced by taking syrup of ipecac , an over-the-\\ncounter product available at any pharmacy.\\nFor acid, alkali, or petroleum product poisonings,\\nthe patient should not vomit. Acids and alkalis can burnthe esophagus if they are vomited, and petroleum prod-ucts can be inhaled into the lungs during vomiting,resulting in pneumonia .Once under medical care, doctors have the option of\\ntreating the patient with a specific remedy to counteractthe poison (antidote) or with activated charcoal toabsorb the substance inside the patient’s digestive sys-tem. In some instances, pumping the stomach may berequired. Medical personnel will also provide supportivecare as needed, such as intravenous fluids or mechanicalventilation.\\nPrognosis\\nThe outcome of poisoning varies from complete\\nrecovery to death, and depends on the type and amountof the poison, the health of the victim, and the speed withwhich medical care is obtained.\\nPrevention\\nMost accidental poisonings are preventable. The\\nnumber of deaths of children from poisoning hasdeclined from about 450 per year in the 1960s to about50 each year in the 1990s.

The underlyingconcept of polarity therapy is that all energy within thehuman body is based in electromagnetic force and thatdisease results from improperly dissipated energy.\\nPurpose\\nPolarity therapy unblocks and recharges the flow of\\nlife energy and realigns unbalanced energy as a means ofeliminating disease. Patients learn to release tension byaddressing the source of the stress and by maintaining a\\nhealthy demeanor accordingly.\\nThis treatment may be effective to promote health\\nand healing to anyone willing to embrace the appropriatelifestyle. Polarity therapy is reportedly effective for any-one who has been exposed to toxic poisons. Likewise,HIV-positive individuals may find comfort in polaritytherapy. Additionally this is an appropriate therapy forrelieving general stress, back pain , stomach cramps, and\\nother recurring maladies and conditions.\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nAustrian-American chiropractor, osteopath, and natur-\\nopath Randolph Stone (1888–1981) developed polaritytherapy as an integration of Eastern and Western principlesand techniques of healing. Stone discovered the ancientprinciples of the Ayurvedic philosophy in the course of histravels during a sojourn in India. On a life-long quest tolearn the fundamentals of human vitality, he also studiedreflexology and traditional Chinese medicine .Stone became committed to the principles of\\nAyurvedic medicine , which he interpreted in conjunction\\nwith his scientific and medical knowledge to define polar-ity therapy. According to the philosophy of Ayurved,which is based in a set of principles called the tridosha—the energy of the human body is centered in five organs orregions (the brain; the cardiopulmonary [heart and lungs]region, the diaphragm, the smaller intestine, and the larg-er intestine). One of five airs or energy forms controlseach respective region: prana in the brain, vyana in theheart and lungs, udana in the diaphragm, samana in thesmaller intestine, and apana in the larger intestine. Thefive airs control all directional motion in the body, witheach air in command of a different type of movement.Stone established further that the prana, centered in thebrain, ultimately controlled the combined forces of thebody. Any impediment or restriction to the flow of pranain turn affects the health of the entire body. The pranaforce is nurtured through the flow of food and air into thebody as well as through our interactions with other livingbeings and through the intake of the five sensory organs.\\nStone devoted much of his life to defining an elabo-\\nrately detailed cause and effect relationship between thehuman anatomy and illness, based on the energy flow ofthe prana. He further attributed electromagnetic energyas the basis of the energy forces. He used the medicalsymbol of the Caduceus to define the patterns of the flowand described the energy movement in detail in charts ofthe human body. Polarity therapy is based in chartedenergy flows. The primary energy pattern is defined in aspiral motion that radiates from the umbilicus anddefines the original energy flow of the fetus in the womb.\\nAfter determining the exact source of a patient’s\\nenergy imbalance, the therapist begins the first of a seriesof bodywork sessions designed to rechannel and releasethe patient’s misdirected prana. This therapy, akin tomassage, is based in energetic pressure and involves cir-culating motions. In performing the regimen, the thera-pist pays strict attention to the pressure exerted at eachlocation—even to which finger is used to apply pressureat any given point of the patient’s anatomy. This tech-nique, which comprises the central regimen or focalpoint of polarity therapy is very gentle and is unique topolarity therapy. It typically involves subtle rockingmovements and cranial holds to stimulate body energy.Although firm, deep pushing touches are employed inconjunction with the massage technique, the polaritytherapist never exerts a particularly forceful contact.\\nTo support the bodywork, the therapist often pre-\\nscribes a diet for the patient, to encourage cleansing andeliminate waste. The precepts of polarity therapy takeinto consideration specific interactions between differentfoods and the human energy fields.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2646Polarity therapy'),\n",

These exercises, called polarity yoga include\\nsquats, stretches, rhythmic movements, deep breathing,and expression of sounds. They can be both energizingand relaxing. Counseling may be included wheneverappropriate as a part of a patient’s highly individual ther-apy regimen to promote balance.\\nPreparations\\nTherapists take a comprehensive case history from\\nevery patient prior to beginning treatment.

(16 June 2000).\\nGloria Cooksey\\nPolio\\nDefinition\\nPoliomyelitis, also called polio or infantile paraly-\\nsis, is a highly infectious viral disease that may attack the\\ncentral nervous system and is characterized by symptomsthat range from a mild nonparalytic infection to totalparalysis in a matter of hours.\\nDescription\\nThere are three known types of polioviruses (called\\n1,2, and 3), each causing a different strain of the diseaseand all are members of the viral family of enteroviruses(viruses that infect the gastrointestinal tract). Type 1 isthe cause of epidemics and many cases of paralysis,which is the most severe manifestation of the infection.The virus is usually a harmless parasite of humanbeings. Some statistics quote one in 200 infections asleading to paralysis while others state that one in 1,000cases reach the central nervous system (CNS). When itdoes reach the CNS, inflammation and destruction ofthe spinal cord motor cells (anterior horn cells) occurs,which prevents them from sending out impulses to mus-cles. This causes the muscles to become limp or soft andthey cannot contract. This is referred to as flaccid paral-ysis and is the type found in polio. The extent of theparalysis depends on where the virus strikes and thenumber of cells that it destroys. Usually, some of thelimb muscles are paralyzed; the abdominal muscles ormuscles of the back may be paralyzed, affecting posture.The neck muscles may become too weak for the head tobe lifted. Paralysis of the face muscles may cause themouth to twist or the eyelids to droop. Life may bethreatened if paralysis of the throat or of the breathingmuscles occurs.\\nMan is the only natural host for polioviruses and it\\nmost commonly infects younger children, although olderchildren and adults can be infected. Crowded living con-ditions and poor hygiene encourage the spread ofpoliovirus. Risk factors for this paralytic illness includeolder age, pregnancy , abnormalities of the immune sys-\\ntem, recent tonsillectomy, and a recent episode of exces-sively strenuous exercise concurrent with the onset of the\\nCNS phase.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPoliovirus can be spread by direct exposure to an\\ninfected individual, and more rarely, by eating foodscontaminated with waste products from the intestines(feces) and/or droplets of moisture (saliva) from aninfected person. Thus, the major route of transmission isfecal-oral, which occurs primarily with poor sanitaryconditions. The virus is believed to enter the bodythrough the mouth with primary multiplication occur-ring in the lymphoid tissues in the throat, where it canpersist for about one week. During this time, it isabsorbed into the blood and lymphatics from the gas-trointestinal tract where it can reside and multiply,sometimes for as long as 17 weeks. Once absorbed, it iswidely distributed throughout the body until it ultimate-ly reaches the CNS (the brain and spinal cord). Theinfection is passed on to others when poor handwashingallows the virus to remain on the hands after eating orusing the bathroom. Transmission remains possiblewhile the virus is being excreted and it can be transmit-ted for as long as the virus remains in the throat or feces.The incubation period ranges from three to 21 days, butcases are most infectious from seven to 10 days beforeand after the onset of symptoms.\\nThere are two basic patterns to the virus: the minor\\nillness (abortive type) and the major illness (which maybe paralytic or nonparalytic). The minor illness accountsfor 80–90% of clinical infections and is found mostly inyoung children. It is mild and does not involve the CNS.Symptoms include a slight fever ,fatigue ,headache ,\\nsore throat , and vomiting, which generally develop\\nthree to five days after exposure. Recovery from theminor illness occurs within 24–72 hours. Symptoms ofthe major illness usually appear without a previous minorillness and generally affect older children and adults.\\nAbout 10% of people infected with poliovirus devel-\\nop severe headache and pain and stiffness of the neck\\nand back. This is due to an inflammation of the meninges(tissues which cover the spinal cord and brain). This syn-drome is called “aseptic meningitis.” The term “aseptic”is used to differentiate this type of meningitis from those\\ncaused by bacteria. The patient usually recovers com-pletely from this illness within several days.\\nAbout 1% of people infected with poliovirus devel-\\nop the most severe form. Some of these patients mayhave two to three symptom-free days between the minorillness and the major illness but the symptoms often\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2648Polio'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 355}, page_content='appear without any previous minor illness. Symptoms\\nagain include headache and back and neck pain. Themajor symptoms, however, are due to invasion of themotor nerves, which are responsible for movement of themuscles. This viral invasion causes inflammation, andthen destruction of these nerves. The muscles, therefore,no longer receive any messages from the brain or spinalcord. The muscles become weak, floppy, and then totallyparalyzed. All muscle tone is lost in the affected limb andthe muscle becomes soft (flaccid). Within a few days, themuscle will begin to decrease in size (atrophy). Theaffected muscles may be on both sides of the body (sym-metric paralysis), but are often on unbalanced parts of thebody (asymmetric paralysis). Sensation or the ability tofeel is not affected in these paralyzed limbs.\\nWhen poliovirus invades the brainstem (the stalk of\\nbrain which connects the two cerebral hemispheres withthe spinal cord; called bulbar polio), a person may beginto have trouble breathing and swallowing. If the brain-stem is severely affected, the brain’s control of such vitalfunctions as heart rate and blood pressure may be dis-turbed. This can lead to death .The maximum state of paralysis is usually reached\\nwithin just a few days. The remaining, unaffected nervesthen begin the process of attempting to grow brancheswhich can compensate for the destroyed nerves. Fortu-nately, the nerve cells are not always completelydestroyed. By the end of a month, the nerve impulsesstart to return to the apparently paralyzed muscle and bythe end of six months, recovery is almost complete. If thenerve cells are completely destroyed, however, paralysisis permanent.\\nDiagnosis\\nFever and asymmetric flaccid paralysis without sen-\\nsory loss in a child or young adult almost always indicatepoliomyelitis. Using a long, thin needle inserted into thelower back to withdraw spinal fluid (lumbar puncture)will reveal increased white blood cells and no bacteria(aseptic meningitis). Nonparalytic poliomyelitis cannotbe distinguished clinically from aseptic meningitis due toother agents. Virus isolated from a throat swab and/orfeces or blood tests demonstrating the rise in a specificantibody is required to confirm the diagnosis.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2649Polio\\nDR. JONAS E. SALK (1914–1995)\\nJonas Salk was born in New York, New York, on\\nOctober 28, 1914. He received his medical degree fromNew York University in 1939. In 1942, Salk began work-ing for a former teacher, Thomas Francis, Jr., to produceinfluenza vaccines, a project that continued until 1949.\\nThat year, as a research professor, Salk began a three-year project sponsored by the National Foundation forInfantile Paralysis, also known as the March of Dimes.Caused by the poliomyelitis virus, polio was also knownas infantile paralysis. Periodic outbreaks of the disease,which attacks the nervous system, caused death or a life-time of paralysis, especially in children. It was a difficultdisease to study because sufficient viruses could not beobtained. Unlike bacteria, which can be grown in cul-tures, viruses need living tissue on which to grow. Oncea method for preparing viruses was discovered andimproved, sufficient viruses became available forresearch.\\nSalk first set out to confirm that there were three\\nvirus types responsible for polio and then began to exper-iment with ways to kill the virus and yet retain its abilityto produce an immune response. By 1952, he had pro-duced a dead virus vaccine that worked against the threevirus types. He began testing. First the vaccine was testedon monkeys, then on children who had recovered fromthe disease, and finally on Salk’s own family and chil-dren, none of whom had ever had the disease. Followinglarge-scale trials in 1954, the vaccine was finally releasedfor public use in 1955. The Salk vaccine was not the firstvaccine against polio, but it was the first to be found safeand effective. By 1961, there was a 96% reduction inpolio cases in the United States.\\n(Library of Congress.)'),\n",

Therapy is designed to make the patient morecomfortable (pain medications and hot packs to soothe themuscles), and intervention if the muscles responsible forbreathing fail (for instance, a ventilator to take over thework of breathing). During active infection, rest on a firmbed is indicated. Physical therapy is the most importantpart of management of paralytic polio during recovery.\\nPrognosis\\nWhen poliovirus causes only the minor illness or\\nsimple aseptic meningitis, the patient can be expectedto recover completely. When the patient is diagnosedwith the major illness, about 50% will recover com-pletely. About 25% of such patients will have slightdisability, and about 25% will have permanent andserious disability. Approximately 1% of all patientswith major illness die. The greatest return of musclefunction occurs in the first six months, but improve-ments may continue for two years.A recently described phenomenon called post-polio\\nsyndrome may begin many years after the initial illness.This syndrome is characterized by a very slow, gradualdecrease in muscle strength.\\nPrevention\\nThere are two types of polio immunizations avail-\\nable in the United States. Both of these vaccines takeadvantage of the fact that infection with polio leads to animmune reaction, which will give the person permanent,lifelong immunity from re-infection with the form ofpoliovirus for which the person was vaccinated.\\nThe Sabin vaccine (also called the oral polio vaccine\\nor OPV) is given to infants by mouth at the same inter-vals as the DPT (three doses). It contains the live, butweakened, poliovirus, which make the recipient immuneto future infections with poliovirus. Because OPV useslive virus, it has the potential to cause infection in indi-viduals with weak immune defenses (both in the personwho receives the vaccine and in close contacts). This is arare complication, however, occurring in only one in 6.8million doses administered and one in every 6.4 milliondoses from having close contact with someone whoreceived the vaccine.\\nThe Salk vaccine (also called the killed polio vac-\\ncine or inactivated polio vaccine) consists of a series ofthree shots that are given just under the skin.

These cysts multiply over time. It was origi-nally believed that the cysts eventually caused kidneyfailure by crowding out the healthy kidney tissue. It isnow thought that the kidney damage seen in PKD isactually the result of the body’s immune system. Theimmune system, in its attempts to rid the kidney of thecysts, instead progressively destroys the formerlyhealthy kidney tissue.\\nDescription\\nA healthy kidney is about the same size as a human\\nfist. PKD cysts, which can be as small as the head of apin or as large as a grapefruit, can expand the kidneysuntil each one is bigger than a football and weighs asmuch as 38 lb (17 kg).\\nThere are two types of PKD: infantile PKD, which\\ngenerally shows symptoms prior to birth; and adult onsetPKD. Individuals affected with infantile PKD are oftenstillborn. Among the liveborn individuals affected withinfantile PKD, very few of these children survive to theage of two. The adult onset form of PKD is much morecommon. The time and degree of symptom onset in theadult form of PKD can vary widely, even within a singlefamily with two or more affected individuals. Symptomsof this form of PKD usually start to appear between theages of 20 and 50. Organ deterioration progresses moreslowly in adult onset PKD than it does in the infantileform; but, if left untreated, adult onset PKD also eventu-ally leads to kidney failure.\\nOne of the most common of all life-threatening\\ngenetic diseases, PKD affects more than 60,000 Ameri-cans. Over 12.5 million people worldwide are affectedwith PKD. Approximately one in every 400 to 1,000 peo-ple is affected with ADPKD. Another one in 10,000 isaffected with ARPKD. PKD is observed in equal num-bers in both males and females. PKD is also observedwith equal frequency among ethnic groups.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPolycystic kidney disease is expressed as both a\\nrecessive and a dominant trait. A recessive genetictrait will not cause disease in a child unless it it inher-itied from both parents. A dominant genetic trait can\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2651Polycystic kidney disease'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 358}, page_content='be inherited from just one parent. Those people\\naffected with autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD)have the much more common adult onset form. Thosewith autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD) have theinfantile form.\\nThere are mutations on at least three genes that\\ncause adult onset PKD. Approximately 85% of thesecases are known to arise from mutations in the PKD1gene that has been mapped to a region on the short armof chromosome 16 (16p13.3-p13.12). Another 10–15%percent of cases of adult onset PKD are thought to becaused by mutations in the PKD2 gene that has beenmapped to a region on the long arm of chromosome 4(4q21-q23). As of early 2001, it is thought that theremainder of the cases of PKD are caused by mutationsin the PKD3 gene, which has not yet been mapped. Thisunidentified “PKD3 gene” may, in fact, be more thanone gene.\\nAdult onset PKD is transmitted from parents to their\\noffspring as a non-sex linked (autosomal) dominant trait.This means that if either parent carries this genetic muta-tion, there is a 50% chance that their child will inheritthis disease. In the case of two affected parents, there is a75% probability that their children will be affected withadult onset PKD.\\nInfantile PKD is caused by a non-sex linked (autoso-\\nmal) recessive genetic mutation that has been mapped toa region on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p21). Bothparents must be carriers of this mutation for their chil-dren to be affected with infantile PKD. In the case of twocarrier parents, the probability is 25% that their child willbe affected by infantile PKD.\\nA baby born with infantile PKD has floppy, low-set\\nears, a pointed nose, a small chin, and folds of skin sur-rounding the eyes (epicanthal folds). Large, rigid massescan be felt on the back of both thighs (flanks), and the\\nbaby usually has trouble breathing.\\nIn the early stages of adult onset PKD, many people\\nshow no symptoms. Generally, the first symptoms todevelop are: high blood pressure ( hypertension ); general\\nfatigue ; pain in the lower back or the backs of the\\nthighs; headaches; and/or urinary tract infections accom-panied by frequent urination.\\nAs PKD becomes more advanced, the kidneys’\\ninability to function properly becomes more pronounced.The cysts on the kidney may begin to rupture and thekidneys tend to be much larger than normal. Individualsaffected with PKD have a much higher rate of kidney\\nstones than the rest of the population at this, and later\\nstages, of the disease. Approximately 60% of those indi-viduals affected with PKD develop cysts in the liver,while 10% develop cysts in the pancreas.\\nBecause the kidneys are primarily responsible for\\ncleaning the blood, individuals affected with PKD oftenhave problems involving the circulatory system. Theseinclude: an underproduction of red blood cells whichresults in an insufficient supply of oxygen to the tissuesand organs (anemia); an enlarged heart (cardiac hypertro-phy) probably caused by long term hypertension; and, aleakage of the valve between the left chambers (auricleand ventricle) of the heart ( mitral valve prolapse ). Less\\ncommon (affecting approximately 5% of PKD patients)are brain aneurysms. An aneurysm is an abnormal andlocalized bulging of the wall of a blood vessel. If ananeurysm within the brain leaks or bursts, it may cause astroke or even death .\\nOther health problems associated with adult onset\\nPKD include: chronic leg or back pain; frequent infec-tions; and herniations of the groin and abdomen, includ-ing herniation of the colon (diverticular disease). A her-niation, or hernia , is caused when a tissue, designed to\\nhold the shape of an underlying tissue, becomes weak-ened at a particular spot. The underlying tissue pushesagainst this weakened area until the area is no longerable to hold back the underlying tissue and the areaforms an abnormal bulge through which the underlyingtissue projects. Diverticular disease is caused by a weak-ening of the muscles that hold the shape of the organs ofthe digestive tract. These muscles weaken allowingthese organs, particularly one section of the colon, toform sac-like projections that can trap feces and becomeinfected, or rupture.\\nIn the final stages of PKD, the major symptom is\\nkidney (renal) failure. Renal failure is indicated by anincrease of nitrogen (in the form of urea) in the blood(uremia, or uremic poisoning ). Uremia is a rapidly fatal\\ncondition without treatment.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2652Polycystic kidney disease\\nA pair of human kidneys.The left is a polycystic kidney, the\\nright is a normal kidney.

Their condition may not be discovered unlesstests that detect it are performed for other reasons.\\nWhen symptoms of PKD are present, the diagnostic\\nprocedure begins with a family medical history andphysical examination of the patient. If several family\\nmembers have PKD, there is a strong likelihood that thepatient has it too. If the disease is advanced, the doctorwill be able to feel the patient’s enlarged kidneys. Heartmurmur, high blood pressure, and other signs of cardiacimpairment can also be detected.\\nUrinalysis and a blood test called creatine clearance\\ncan indicate how effectively the kidneys are functioning.Scanning procedures using intravenous dye reveal kid-ney enlargement or deformity and scarring caused bycysts. Ultrasound and computed tomography scans (CT\\nscans) can reveal kidney enlargement and the cysts thatcaused it. CT scans can highlight cyst-damaged areas ofthe kidneys. A sampling of the kidney cells (biopsy) maybe performed to verify the diagnosis.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no way to prevent cysts from forming or\\nbecoming enlarged, or to prevent PKD from progressingto kidney failure.

JohnsonPolycystic ovary syndrome\\nDefinition\\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition\\ncharacterized by the accumulation of numerous cysts(fluid-filled sacs) on the ovaries associated with highmale hormone levels, chronic anovulation (absent ovula-tion), and other metabolic disturbances. Classic symp-toms include excess facial and body hair, acne ,obesity ,\\nirregular menstrual cycles, and infertility .\\nDescription\\nPCOS, also called Stein-Leventhal syndrome, is a\\ngroup of symptoms caused by underlying hormonal andmetabolic disturbances that affect about 6% of pre-menopausal women. PCOS symptoms appear as early asadolescence in the form of amenorrhea (missed periods),\\nobesity, and hirsutism , the abnormal growth of body hair.\\nA disturbance in normal hormonal signals prevents\\novulation in women with PCOS. Throughout the cycle,estrogen levels remain steady, luteinizing hormone (LH)levels are high, and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)and progesterone levels are low. Since eggs are rarely ornever released from their follicles, multiple ovarian\\ncysts develop over time.\\nOne of the most important characteristics of PCOS is\\nhyperandrogenism, the excessive production of male hor-mones (androgens), particularly testosterone, by theovaries. This accounts for the male hair-growth patternsand acne in women with PCOS. Hyperandrogenism hasbeen linked with insulin resistance (the inability of thebody to respond to insulin) and hyperinsulinemia (highblood insulin levels), both of which are common in PCOS.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nWhile the exact cause of PCOS is unknown, it runs\\nin families, so the tendency to develop the syndrome maybe inherited. The interaction of hyperinsulinemia andhyperandrogenism is believed to play a role in chronicanovulation in susceptible women.\\nThe numbers and types of PCOS symptoms that\\nappear vary among women. These include:\\n• Hirsutism. Related to hyperandrogenism, this occurs in\\n70% of women.\\n• Obesity. Approximately 40–70% of persons with PCOS\\nare overweight.\\n• Anovulation and menstrual disturbances. Anovulation\\nappears as amenorrhea in 50% of women, and as heavyuterine bleeding in 30% of women. However, 20% ofwomen with PCOS have normal menstruation.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2654Polycystic ovary syndrome'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 361}, page_content='• Male-pattern hair loss. Some women with PCOS devel-\\nop bald spots.\\n• Infertility. Achieving pregnancy is difficult for many\\nwomen with PCOS.\\n• Polycystic ovaries. Most, but not all, women with\\nPCOS have multiple cysts on their ovaries.\\n• Skin discoloration. Some women with PCOS have dark\\npatches on their skin.\\n• Abnormal blood chemistry. Women with PCOS have\\nhigh levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL or “bad”)cholesterol and triglycerides, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL or “good”) cholesterol.\\n• Hyperinsulinemia. Some women with PCOS have high\\nblood insulin levels, particularly if they are overweight.\\nDiagnosis\\nPCOS is diagnosed when a woman visits her doctor\\nfor treatment of symptoms such as hirsutism, obesity, men-strual irregularities, or infertility. Women with PCOS aretreated by a gynecologist, a doctor who treats diseases ofthe female reproductive organs, or a reproductive endocri-nologist, a specialist who treats diseases of the body’sendocrine (hormones and glands) system and infertility.\\nPCOS can be difficult to diagnose because its symp-\\ntoms are similar to those of many other diseases or con-ditions, and because all of its symptoms may not occur.A doctor takes a complete medical history, includingquestions about menstruation and reproduction, andweight gain. Physical examination includes a pelvic\\nexamination to determine the size of the ovaries, andvisual inspection of the skin for hirsutism, acne, or otherchanges. Blood tests are performed to measure levels ofluteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, estro-gens, androgens, glucose, and insulin. A glucose-toler-ance test may be administered. An ultrasound examina-tion of the ovaries is performed to evaluate their size andshape. Most insurance plans cover the costs of diagnos-ing and treating PCOS and its related problems.\\nTreatment\\nPCOS treatment is aimed at correcting anovulation,\\nrestoring normal menstrual periods, improving fertility,eliminating hirsutism and acne, and preventing future com-plications related to high insulin and blood lipid (fat) levels.Treatment consists of weight loss, drugs or surgery, andhair removal, depending upon which symptoms are mostbothersome, and whether a woman desires pregnancy.\\nWeight loss\\nIn overweight women, weight loss (as little as 5%)\\nthrough diet and exercise may correct hyperandro-genism, and restore normal ovulation and fertility. This is\\noften tried first.\\nDrugs\\nHORMONAL DRUGS. Women who do not want to\\nbecome pregnant and require contraception (sponta-\\nneous ovulation occurs occasionally among women withPCOS) are treated with low-dose oral contraceptive pills(OCPs). OCPs bring on regular menstrual periods andcorrect heavy uterine bleeding, as well as hirsutism,although improvement may not be seen for up to a year.\\nIf an infertile woman desires to become pregnant, the\\nfirst drug usually given to help induce ovulation isclomiphene citrate (Clomid), which results in pregnancyin about 70% of women but can cause multiple births. Inthe 20–25% of women who do not respond to clomiphene,other drugs that stimulate follicle development and induceovulation, such as human menstrual gonadotropin (Perg-onal) and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), aregiven. However, these drugs have a lower pregnancy rate(less than 30%), a higher rate of multiple pregnancy\\n(from 5–30%, depending on the dose of the drug), and ahigher risk of medical problems. Women with PCOS havea high rate of miscarriage (30%), and may be treated with\\nthe gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist leuprolide(Lupron) to reduce this risk.\\nSince women with PCOS do not have regular endome-\\ntrial shedding due to high estrogen levels, they are atincreased risk for overgrowth of this tissue and endometri-\\nal cancer . The drug medroxyprogesterone acetate, when\\ntaken for the first 10 days of each month, causes regularshedding of the endometrium, and reduces the risk of can-\\ncer. However, in most cases, oral contraceptive pills are\\nused instead to bring about regular menstruation.\\nOTHER DRUGS. Another drug that helps to trigger\\novulation is the steroid hormone dexamethasone. Thisdrug acts by reducing the production of androgens by theadrenal glands.\\nThe antiandrogen spironolactone (Aldactazide),\\nwhich is usually given with an oral contraceptive,improves hirsutism and male-pattern baldness by reduc-ing androgen production, but has no effect on fertility.The drug causes abnormal uterine bleeding and is linkedwith birth defects if taken during pregnancy. Another\\nantiandrogen used to treat hirsutism, flutamide (Eulexin),can cause liver abnormalities, fatigue , mood swings, and\\nloss of sexual desire. A drug used to reduce insulin lev-els, metformin (Glucophage), has shown promisingresults in women with PCOS hirsutism, but its effects oninfertility and other PCOS symptoms are unknown. Drugtreatment of hirsutism is long-term, and improvementmay not be seen for up to a year or longer.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2655Polycystic ovary syndrome'),\n",

A wedge resec-tion, the surgical removal of part of the ovary and cyststhrough a laparoscope (an instrument inserted into thepelvis through a small incision), or an abdominal incision,reduces androgen production and restores ovulation.Although laparoscopic surgery is less likely to cause scartissue formation than abdominal surgery, both are associ-ated with the potential for scarring that may require addi-tional surgery. Laparoscopic ovarian drilling is anothertype of laparoscopic surgery used to treat PCOS. Theovarian cysts are penetrated with a laser beam and someof the fluid is drained off. Between 50–65% of womenmay become pregnant after either type of surgery.\\nSome cases of severe hirsutism are treated by removal\\nof the uterus ( hysterectomy ) and the ovaries (oopherecto-\\nmy), followed by estrogen replacement therapy.\\nOther treatment\\nHirsutism may be treated by hair removal techniques\\nsuch as shaving, depilatories (chemicals that break downthe structure of the hair), tweezing, waxing, electrolysis(destruction of the hair root by an electrical current), orthe destruction of hair follicles by laser therapy. Howev-er, the treatments may have to be repeated.\\nAlternative treatment\\nPCOS can be addressed using many types of alterna-\\ntive treatment. The rebalancing of hormones is a primaryfocus of all these therapies. Acupuncture works on the\\nbody’s energy flow according to the meridian system.Chinese herbs, such as gui zhi fu ling wan , can be effec-\\ntive. In naturopathic medicine , treatment focuses on\\nhelping the liver function more optimally in the horomon-al balancing process. Dietary changes, including reducinganimal products and fats, while increasing foods thatnourish the liver such as carrots, dark green vegetables,lemons, and beets, can be beneficial. Essential fatty acids,including flax oil, evening primrose oil ( Oenothera bien-\\nnis), and black currant oil, act as anti-inflammatories and\\nhormonal regulators. Western herbal medicine uses phy-toestrogen and phytoprogesteronic herbs, such as bluecohosh ( Caulophyllum thalictroides ) and false unicorn\\nroot ( Chamaelirium luteum ), as well as liver herbs, like\\ndandelion ( Taraxacum mongolicum ), to work toward hor-\\nmonal balance. Supplementation with antioxidants,including zinc, and vitamins A, E, and C, is also recom-mended. Constitutional homeopathy can bring about a\\ndeep level of healing with the correct remedies.\\nPrognosis\\nWith proper diagnosis and treatment, most PCOS\\nsymptoms can be adequately controlled or eliminated.Infertility can be corrected and pregnancy achieved in mostwomen although, in some, hormonal disturbances andanovulation may recur. Women should be monitored forendometrial cancer. Because of the high rate of hyperinsu-linemia seen in PCOS, women with the disorder shouldhave their glucose levels checked regularly to watch for thedevelopment of diabetes. Blood pressure and cholesterolscreening are also needed because these women also tendto have high levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides,which put them at risk for developing heart disease.\\nPrevention\\nThere is no known way to prevent PCOS, but if\\ndiagnosed and treated early, risks for complications suchas heart disease and diabetes may be minimized. Weightcontrol through diet and exercise stabilizes hormonesand lowers insulin levels.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCarr, Bruce R and Bradshaw, Karen D. “Disorders of the ovary\\nand remale reproductive tract.” In Harrison’s Principles of\\nInternal Medicine, 14th ed., edited by Anthony S.

Fleming Fallon, Jr., MD, DrPH\\nPolycythemia seeSecondary polycythemia\\nPolycythemia rubra vera seePolycythemia\\nvera\\nPolycythemia vera\\nDefinition\\nPolycythemia vera (PV) is a chronic blood disorder\\nmarked by an abnormal increase in three types of bloodcells produced by bone marrow: red blood cells (RBCs),white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets. PV is called amyeloproliferative disorder, which means that the bonemarrow is producing too many cells too quickly. Most ofthe symptoms of PV are related to the increased volumeof the patient’s blood and its greater thickness (high vis-cosity). PV sometimes evolves into a different myelopro-liferative disorder or into acute leukemia.\\nDescription\\nPolycythemia vera is a relatively common progres-\\nsive disorder that develops over a course of 10–20 years.In the United States, PV affects about one person inevery 200,000. PV has several other names, includingsplenomegalic polycythemia, Vaquez-Osler syndrome,erythremia, and primary polycythemia. Primary poly-cythemia means that the disorder is not caused or trig-gered by other illnesses. PV most commonly affects mid-dle-aged adults. It is rarely seen in children or youngadults and does not appear to run in families. Themale/female ratio is 2:1.\\nRisk factors for polycythemia vera include:\\n• caucasian race• male sex• age between 40 and 60\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of PV remains uncertain. In general, the\\nincreased mass of red blood cells in the patient’s bloodcauses both hemorrhage and abnormal formation ofblood clots in the circulatory system (thrombosis). Thereasons for these changes in clotting patterns are not yetfully understood.Early symptoms\\nThe symptoms of early PV may be minimal—it is not\\nunusual for the disorder to be discovered during a routineblood test. More often, however, patients have symptomsthat include headaches, ringing in the ears, tiring easily,memory problems, difficulty breathing, giddiness or light-headedness, hypertension , visual problems, or tingling or\\nburning sensations in their hands or feet. Another commonsymptom is itching (pruritus). Pruritus related to PV is\\noften worse after the patient takes a warm bath or shower.\\nSome patients’ early symptoms include unusually\\nheavy bleeding from minor cuts, nosebleeds, stomachulcers, or bone pain . In a few cases, the first symptom is\\nthe development of blood clots in an unusual part of thecirculatory system (e.g., the liver).\\nLater symptoms and complications\\nAs the disease progresses, patients with PV may\\nhave episodes of hemorrhage or thrombosis. Thrombosisis the most frequent cause of death from PV . Other com-\\nplications include a high level of uric acid in the bloodand an increased risk of peptic ulcer disease. About 10%of PV patients eventually develop gout ; another 10%\\ndevelop peptic ulcers.\\nSpent phase\\nThe spent phase is a development in late PV that\\naffects about 30% of patients. The bone marrow eventual-ly fails and the patient becomes severely anemic, requiringrepeated blood transfusions. The spleen and liver becomegreatly enlarged—in the later stages of PV , the patient’sspleen may fill the entire left side of the abdomen.\\nDiagnosis\\nPhysical examination\\nPV is often a diagnosis of exclusion, which means that\\nthe doctor will first rule out other possible causes of thepatient’s symptoms. The doctor can detect some signs ofthe disorder during a physical examination . Patients with\\nPV will have an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) in 75% ofcases. About 50% will have a slightly enlarged liver. Thedoctor can feel these changes when he or she presses on(palpates) the patient’s abdomen while the patient is lyingflat. An eye examination will usually reveal swollen veins\\nat the back of the eye. Patients with PV often have unusual-ly red complexions; mottled red patches on their legs, feet,or hands; or swelling at the ends of the fingers.\\nDiagnostic criteria for PV\\nAccurate diagnosis of PV is critical because its treat-\\nment may require the use of drugs with the potential to\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2658Polycythemia vera'),\n",

The results of the patient’s blood tests\\nare evaluated according to criteria worked out around1970 by the Polycythemia Vera Study Group. The patientis considered to have PV if all three major criteria aremet; or if the first two major criteria and any two minorcriteria are met.\\nMajor criteria:\\n• red blood cell mass greater than 36 mL/kg in males,\\ngreater than 32 mL/kg in females\\n• arterial oxygen level greater than 92%• splenomegaly\\nMinor criteria:\\n• platelet count greater than 400,000/mm\\n3\\n• WBC greater than 12,000/mm3without fever or infection\\n• leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) score greater than\\n100 with increased blood serum levels of vitamin B12\\nLaboratory testing\\nBLOOD TESTS. The diagnosis of PV depends on a set\\nof findings from blood tests. The most important singlemeasurement is the patient’s red blood cell mass as a pro-portion of the total blood volume. This measurement ismade by tagging RBCs with radioactive chromium (\\n51Cr)\\nin order to determine the patient’s RBC volume. While afew patients with PV may have a red cell mass level withinthe normal range if they have had recent heavy bleeding, ahigh score may eliminate the need for some other tests. Ascore higher than 36 mL/kg for males and 32 mL/kg forfemales on the \\n51Cr test suggests PV . Measurements of the\\noxygen level in the patient’s arterial blood, of the concen-tration of vitamin B\\n12in the blood serum, and of leukocyte\\nalkaline phosphatase (LAP) staining can be used to distin-guish PV from certain types of leukemia or from othertypes of polycythemia. LAP staining measures the intensi-ty of enzyme activity in a type of white blood cell called aneutrophil. In PV , the LAP score is higher than normalwhereas in leukemia it is below normal.\\nBONE MARROW TESTS. Bone marrow testing can be\\nused as part of the diagnostic process. A sample of mar-row can be cultured to see if red blood cell coloniesdevelop without the addition of a hormone that stimu-lates RBC production. The growth of a cell colony with-out added hormone indicates PV . Bone marrow testing isalso important in monitoring the progress of the disease,particularly during the spent phase.\\nGENETIC TESTING. Genetic testing can be used to rule\\nout the possibility of chronic myeloid leukemia. Patientswith this disease have a characteristic chromosomal abnor-mality called the Philadelphia chromosome. The Philadel-phia chromosome does notoccur in patients with PV .Imaging studies\\nImaging studies are not necessary to make the diag-\\nnosis of PV . In some cases, however, imaging studies candetect enlargement of the spleen that the doctor may notbe able to feel during the physical examination.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of PV is tailored to the individual patient\\naccording to his or her age, the severity of the symptomsand complications, and the stage of the disease.\\nPhlebotomy\\nPhlebotomy is the withdrawal of blood from a vein.\\nIt is the first line of treatment for patients with PV . Phle-botomy is used to bring down the ratio of red blood cellsto fluid volume (the hematocrit ) in the patient’s blood to\\na level below 45%. In most cases the doctor will with-draw about 500 mL of blood (about 15 fluid ounces)once or twice a week until the hematocrit is low enough.Phlebotomy is considered the best course of treatmentfor patients younger than 60 and for women of childbear-ing age. Its drawback is that patients remain at some riskfor either thrombosis or hemorrhage.\\nMyelosuppression\\nMyelosuppressive therapies are used to slow down\\nthe body’s production of blood cells. They are given topatients who are older than 60 and at high risk for throm-bosis. These therapies, however, increase the patient’srisk of developing leukemia. The substances most fre-quently used as of 1998 include hydroxyurea (Hydrea),interferon alfa (Intron), or radioactive phosphorus (\\n32P).\\n32P is used only in elderly patients with life expectancies\\nof less than five years because it causes leukemia inabout 10% of patients. Interferon alfa is expensive andcauses side effects resembling the symptoms of influen-\\nzabut is an option for some younger PV patients.\\nInvestigational treatment\\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has\\napproved the use of anagrelide, an orphan drug, forinvestigational use in the treatment of PV . Anagrelide hasmoderate side effects and controls the platelet level inover 90% of patients.\\nTreatment of complications\\nThe itching caused by PV is often difficult to con-\\ntrol. Patients with pruritus are given diphenhydramine(Benadryl) or another antihistamine. Patients with highlevels of uric acid are usually given allopurinol (Lopurin,Zyloprim) by mouth.

This problem can be mini-mized by advising patients to eat small meals followedby rest periods.\\nBecause of the clotting problems related to PV ,\\npatients should not undergo surgery until their bloodcounts are close to normal levels. Female patients ofchildbearing age should be warned about the dangers ofpregnancy related to their clotting abnormalities.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for untreated polycythemia vera is\\npoor; 50% of patients die within 18 months after diagno-sis.

The fusion can be simple with the digits connect-ed only by skin, or it can be complicated with sharedbones, nerves, vessels, or nails.\\nPolydactyly and syndactyly can occur simultaneous-\\nly when extra digits are fused. This condition is known aspolysyndactyly.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPolydactyly and syndactyly are due to errors in the\\nprocess of fetal development. For example, syndactylyresults from the failure of the programmed cell death thatnormally occurs between digits. Most often these errorsare due to genetic defects.\\nPolydactyly and syndactyly can both occur by them-\\nselves as isolated conditions or in conjunction with othersymptoms as one aspect of a multi-symptom disease.There are several forms of isolated syndactyly and sever-al forms of isolated polydactyly; each of these, where thegenetics is understood, is caused by an autosomal domi-nant gene. This means that since the gene is autosomal(not sex-linked), males and females are equally likely toinherit the trait. This also means that since the gene isdominant, children who have only one parent with thetrait have a 50% chance of inheriting it. However, peoplein the same family carrying the same gene can have dif-ferent degrees of polydactyly or syndactyly.\\nPolydactyly and syndactyly are also possible out-\\ncomes of a large number of rare inherited and develop-mental disorders. One or both of them can be present inover 100 different disorders where they are minor fea-\\ntures compared to other characteristics of these diseases.\\nFor example, polydactyly is a characteristic of\\nMeckel syndrome and Laurence-Moon-Biedl syndrome.Polydactyly may also be present in Patau’s syndrome,asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy, hereditary spherocytichemolytic anemia , Moebius syndrome, V ACTERL asso-\\nciation, and Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome.\\nSyndactyly is a characteristic of Apert syndrome,\\nPoland syndrome, Jarcho-Levin syndrome, oral-facial-digital syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome, and Edwards syn-drome. Syndactyly may also occur with Gordon syn-drome, Fraser syndrome, Greig cephalopolysyndactyly,phenylketonuria , Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, Russell-\\nSilver syndrome, and triploidy.\\nIn some isolated cases of polydactyly or syndactyly,\\nit is not possible to determine the cause. Some of thesecases might nevertheless be due to genetic defects; some-times there is too little information to demonstrate agenetic cause. Some cases might be due to external fac-tors like exposure to toxins or womb anomalies.\\nDiagnosis\\nPolydactyly and syndactyly can be diagnosed by\\nexternal observation, x ray, and fetal sonogram.\\nTreatment\\nPolydactyly can be corrected by surgical removal of\\nthe extra digit or partial digit.

It is contained within the\\namniotic membrane that forms the amniotic sac (bag ofwaters). During the first three months after conception(first trimester), amniotic fluid is mainly derived from theblood plasma that diffuses through the thin tissues of thefetus into the surrounding space. After the fetal kidneysform and become functional at about 10-11 weeks, fetalurine becomes the main source of amniotic fluid andremains so for the rest of the pregnancy. In addition, thelungs also produce liquid that becomes part of the amniot-ic fluid. Other contributions come from fetal oral andnasal secretions and from the fetal surface of the placenta.Amniotic fluid removal is largely due to fetal swallowingand absorption into the fetal blood. Uptake also occursacross the placental surface. The volume of amniotic fluidnormally increases throughout pregnancy, reaching apeak at about 32-33 weeks and remaining fairly constantor decreasing slightly thereafter. There is a wide range of\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2663Polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios'),\n",

Through the processes of swallowing andurination, a fetus can recycle the entire volume in lessthan 24 hours. Because the normal values for amnioticfluid volume increase during pregnancy, the actual vol-ume that constitutes polyhydramnios is dependent on thegestational age of the fetus. During the last two months ofpregnancy, polyhydramnios usually refers to amnioticfluid volumes greater than 1,700-1,900 ml. Severe casesare associated with much greater fluid volume excesses.The range of fluid values diagnostic of oligohydramniosis not as wide as that for polyhydramnios. Less than 300ml, or lower than the 5% percentile for gestational age, isusually considered the upper threshold.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPolyhydramnios, also referred to as hydramnios, can\\nhave any one of a number of causes related either to anunderlying maternal or fetal condition. Maternal dia-betes, which is associated with a macrosomic (enlarged)fetus, is a common cause. The medication lithium, usedto treat depression, can also increase amniotic fluid lev-els. Twin gestations are prone to polyhydramnios. Infec-tions passed from mother to fetus such as rubella ,\\ncytomegalovirus, and toxoplasmosis , can also result in\\ndamage to the fetus and elevated amniotic fluid levels.Fetal abnormalities, including many that are life-threat-ening or lead to a significant impairment in the quality oflife, are found in up to a quarter of all patients. For thisreason, the initial finding of excess amniotic fluid shouldbe followed by thorough diagnostic studies to determinethe cause and the prognosis.\\nBecause fetal swallowing is a major factor in amniotic\\nfluid removal, fetal abnormalities that prevent fluid uptakeshould be investigated. These include gastrointestinalobstructions such as esophageal atresia and duodenal atre-\\nsia, as well as neurological conditions that affect swallow-ing including anencephaly. Certain cardiac abnormalities,kidney disorders, and genetic conditions such as myotonic\\ndystrophy and alpha-thalassemia can also cause polyhy-\\ndramnios. Fetal chromosome abnormalities are frequentlyassociated with elevated amniotic fluid levels. The moresevere the polyhydramnios the more likely it is that fetalabnormalities will be present. In addition, there are other,infrequent causes, and in a number of cases, no cause canbe found. Polyhydramnios can lead to maternal abdominaldiscomfort and respiratory difficulties as well as pretermlabor. When polyhydramnios is associated with fetal abnor-malities, perinatal mortality is significantly increased.\\nOligohydramnios is most commonly associated with\\nabnormalities of the fetal kidneys. Since fetal urine is themain source of amniotic fluid in the latter two-thirds ofpregnancy, any condition that interferes with fetal urine\\nproduction can lead to oligohydramnios. Renal agenesis,cystic kidneys, and bladder outlet obstructions are com-mon. Meckel-Gruber syndrome, a lethal autosomal reces-sive genetic disorder featuring brain and kidney abnor-malities and extra digits is one specific cause. Placentalinsufficiency and fetal growh retardation can also result inoligohydramnios. Premature rupture of membranes ,\\nespecially between 16 and 24 weeks is another cause and,because amniotic fluid is important in lung growth, it canlead to underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonaryhypoplasia). In general, regardless of the cause, oligohy-dramnios that arises early in a pregnancy, can causehypoplastic lungs. It can also result in space limitationswithin the amniotic sac that cause fetal compression andorthopedic abnormalities such as clubbed feet in the new-born. In general, oligohydramnios that begins near thetime of delivery is associated with a better outcome thancases than have an onset earlier in pregnancy.\\nDiagnosis\\nIn current obstetrical practice, polyhydramnios and\\noligohydramnios are usually detected during a routineprenatal ultrasound. If the ultrasonographer suspects thatexcess or reduced fluid is present, it is customary to takemeasurements of pockets of fluid visualized around thefetus, calculate the amniotic fluid index (AFI), and com-pare it to AFI values found in standard tables. Subse-quent ultrasound measurements can then be used to trackthe increase or decrease in fluid.\\nIt is extremely important that the cause of an abnor-\\nmal AFI be sought. Because of the high risk of fetalabnormalities, detailed ultrasound exams (targetedexams) should then be performed. The mother should becounseled about the possible complications and offeredadditional testing as necessary. For example, an amnio-\\ncentesis for prenatal chromosome analysis may be\\nimportant because of the high risk of fetal chromosomeabnormalities. This test is usually indicated if fetalabnormalities are suspected on the basis of the ultra-sound exam. An amniocentesis can also be used to checkfor fetal infections and some rare single gene defects.\\nTreatment\\nEffective treatments for polyhydramnios and oligo-\\nhydramnios are limited. To relieve maternal discomfort,an excess fluid level can be reduced by inserting a needleinto the amniotic sac and using a syringe to withdrawexcess fluid. This can be done repeatedly, if necessary. Inoligohydramnios, the opposite approach of adding fluideither by increasing oral intake in the mother or by direct-ly infusing saline into the amniotic sac has been tried inselect cases.

Rarely does it affect people under 50years old. The average age is 70; women are afflictedtwice as often as men. Along with the pain and stiff-ness of larger muscles, headache may add to the dis-\\ncomfort. The scalp is often tender. Pain is usuallyworse at night. There may be fever and weight loss\\nbefore the full disease appears.

Others\\ninclude dermatomyositis (DM) and inclusion body myosi-tis. All three types are progressive conditions, usuallybeginning in adulthood. A fourth type, juvenile dermato-myositis, occurs in children. Although PM and DM canoccur at any age, 60% of cases appear between the ages of30 and 60. Females are affected twice as often as males.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe cause of PM and DM is not known, but it is sus-\\npected that a variety of factors may play a role in thedevelopment of these diseases. PM and DM may beautoimmune diseases, caused by the immune system’sattack on the body’s own tissue. The reason for thisattack is unknown, although some researchers believethat a combination of immune system susceptibility andan environmental trigger may explain at least somecases. Known environmental agents associated with PMand DM include infectious agents such as Toxoplasma ,\\nBorrella (Lyme disease bacterium), and coxsackievirus.\\nMost cases, however, have no obvious triggers (directcausative agents). There may also be a genetic compo-nent in the development of PM and DM.\\nSymptoms\\nThe early symptoms of PM and DM are slowly pro-\\ngressing muscle weakness, usually symmetrical betweenthe two sides of the body. PM and DM affect primarilythe muscles of the trunk and those closest to the trunk,while the hands, feet, and face usually are not involved.Weakness may cause difficulty walking, standing, andlifting objects. Rarely, the muscles of breathing may beaffected. Weakness of the muscles used for swallowingcan cause difficulty with swallowing (dysphagia). Jointpain and/or swelling also may be present. Later in thecourse of these diseases, muscle wasting or shortening(contracture) may develop in the arms or legs. Heartabnormalities, including electrocardiogram (ECG)changes and arrhythmias , develop at some time during\\nthe coursed of these diseases in about 30% of patients.\\nDermatomyositis is marked by a skin rash. The rash\\nis dusky, reddish, or lilac in color, and is most often seenon the eyelids, cheeks, bridge of the nose, and knuckles,as well as on the back, upper chest, knees, and elbows.The rash often appears before the muscle weakness.\\nDiagnosis\\nPM and DM are often difficult diseases to diagnose,\\nbecause they are rare, because symptoms come on slow-ly, and because they can be mistaken for other diseasesthat cause muscle weakness, especially limb girdle mus-\\ncular dystrophy .\\nAccurate diagnosis involves:\\n• A neurological exam.• Blood tests to determine the level of the muscle enzyme\\ncreatine kinase, whose presence in the circulation indi-cates muscle damage.\\n• Electromyography, an electrical test of muscle func-\\ntion.\\n• Muscle biopsy, in which a small sample of affected\\nmuscle is surgically removed for microscopic analysis.A biopsy revealing muscle cells surrounded by immunesystem cells is a strong indicator of myositis.\\nTreatment\\nPM and DM respond to high doses of immunosup-\\npressant drugs in most cases. The most common medica-\\ntion used is the corticosteroid prednisone. Prednisone ther-apy usually leads to improvement within two or threemonths, at which point the dose can be tapered to a lowerlevel to avoid the significant side effects associated withhigh doses of prednisone. Unresponsive patients are oftengiven a replacement or supplementary immunosuppressant,such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, or methotrexate. Intra-venous immunoglobulin treatments may help some peoplewho are unresponsive to other immunosuppressants.\\nPain can usually be controlled with an over-the-\\ncounter analgesic, such as aspirin , ibuprofen, or naproxen.\\nA speech-language therapist can help suggest exercisesand tips to improve difficulty in swallowing. Avoidingweight gain helps prevent overtaxing weakened muscles.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAs with all autoimmune conditions, food allergies/\\nintolerances and environmental triggers may be contribut-ing factors. For the food allergies and intolerances, an\\nelimination challenge diet can be used under the supervi-sion of a trained practitioner, naturopath, or nutritionist, toidentify trigger foods. These foods can then be eliminatedfrom the person’s diet. For environmental triggers, it ishelpful to identify the source so that it can be avoided oreliminated. A thorough detoxification program can help\\nalleviate symptoms and change the course of the disease.Dietary changes from processed foods to whole foods thatdo not include allergen triggers can have significantresults. Nutrient supplements, especially the antioxidantszinc, selenium, and vitamins A, C, and E, can be benefi-\\ncial. Constitutional homeopathic treatment can work at adeep level to rebalance the whole person.

Immunosuppressants can improvestrength, although not all patients respond, and relapsesmay occur. PM and DM can lead to increasing weaknessand disability, although the lifespan usually is not signifi-cantly affected.

Polysomnogra-phy is an overnight test to evaluate sleep disorders .\\nPolysomnography generally includes monitoring of thepatient’s airflow through the nose and mouth, blood pres-sure, electrocardiographic activity, blood oxygen level,brain wave pattern, eye movement, and the movement ofrespiratory muscle and limbs.\\nPurpose\\nPolysomnography is used to help diagnose and\\nevaluate a number of sleep disorders. For instance, itcan help diagnose sleep apnea , a common disorder in\\nmiddle-aged and elderly obese men, in which the mus-cles of the soft palate in the back of the throat relax andclose off the airway during sleep. This may cause theperson to snore loudly and gasp for air at night, and tobe excessively sleepy and doze off during the day.Another syndrome often evaluated by polysomnogra-phy is narcolepsy . In narcolepsy, people have sudden\\nattacks of sleep and/or cataplexy (temporary loss ofmuscle tone caused by moments of emotion, such asfear, anger, or surprise, which causes people to slumpor fall over), sleep paralysis or hallucinations at the\\nonset of sleep. Polysomnography is often used to evalu-ate parasomnias (abnormal behaviors or movementsduring sleep), such as sleep walking, talking in one’ssleep, nightmares, and bedwetting. It can also be usedto detect or evaluate seizures that occur in the middle ofthe night, when the patient and his or her family areunlikely to be aware of them.\\nPrecautions\\nPolysomnography is extremely safe and no special\\nprecautions need to be taken.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2668Polysomnography'),\n",

During this stay, while the patientsleeps, he or she is monitored in a number of ways thatcan provide very useful information.\\nOne form of monitoring is electroencephalography\\n(EEG), in which electrodes are attached to the patient’sscalp in order to record his or her brain wave activity. Theelectroencephalograph records brain wave activity fromdifferent parts of the brain and charts them on a graph.The EEG not only helps doctors establish what stage ofsleep the patient is in, but may also detect seizures.\\nAnother form of monitoring is continuous electro-\\noculography (EOG), which records eye movement and isused to determine when the patient is going through astage of sleep called rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep.Both EEG and EOG can be helpful in determining sleeplatency (the time that transpires between lights out andthe onset of sleep), total sleep time, the time spent ineach sleep stage, and the number of arousals from sleep.\\nThe air flow through the patient’s nose and mouth\\nare measured by heat-sensitive devices called thermis-tors. This can help detect episodes of apnea (stoppedbreathing), or hypnopea (inadequate breathing). Anoth-er test called pulse oximetry measures the amount ofoxygen in the blood, and can be used to assess thedegree of oxygen starvation during episodes of hypno-pea or apnea.\\nThe electrical activity of the patient’s heart is also\\nmeasured on an electrocardiogram, or ECG. Electrodesare affixed to the patient’s chest and they pick up electri-cal activity from various areas of the heart. They helpdetect cardiac arrythmias (abnormal heart rhythms),which may occur during periods of sleep apnea. Bloodpressure is also measured: sometimes episodes of sleepapnea can dangerously elevate blood pressure.\\nIn some cases, sleep laboratories monitor the move-\\nment of limbs during sleep. This can be helpful in detectingsuch sleep disorders as periodic limb movements.\\nPreparation\\nThe patient may be asked to discontinue taking any\\nmedications used to help him/her sleep.

Porphyrin is a foundation structure for hemeand certain enzymes. Excess porphyrins are excreted aswaste in the urine and stool. Overproduction and overex-cretion of porphyrins causes low, unhealthy levels ofheme and certain important enzymes, creating variousphysical symptoms.\\nDescription\\nBiosynthesis of heme is a multistep process that\\nbegins with simple molecules and ends with a large, com-plex heme molecule. Each step of the chemical pathway isdirected by its own task-specific protein, called an enzyme.As a heme precursor molecule moves through each step, anenzyme modifies the precursor in some way. If a precursormolecule is not modified, it cannot proceed to the next step,causing a buildup of that specific precursor.\\nThis situation is the main characteristic of the por-\\nphyrias. Owing to a defect in one of the enzymes of theheme biosynthesis pathway, protoporphyrins or por-phyrins (heme precursors) are prevented from proceed-ing further along the pathway. These precursors accumu-late at the stage of the enzyme defect causing an array ofphysical symptoms in an affected person. Specific symp-toms depend on the point at which heme biosynthesis isblocked and which precursors accumulate. In general,the porphyrias primarily affect the skin and the nervoussystem. Symptoms can be debilitating or life threateningin some cases. Porphyria is most commonly an inheritedcondition. It can also, however, be acquired after expo-sure to poisonous substances.\\nHeme\\nHeme is produced in several tissues in the body, but\\nits primary biosynthesis sites are the liver and the bonemarrow. Heme synthesis for immature red blood cells,namely the erythroblasts and the reticulocytes, occurs inthe bone marrow.\\nAlthough production is concentrated in the liver and\\nbone marrow, heme is utilized in various capacities in vir-tually every tissue in the body. In most cells, heme is akey building block in the construction of factors that over-see metabolism and transport of oxygen and energy. Inthe liver, heme is a component of several vital enzymes,particularly cytochrome P450. Cytochrome P450 isinvolved in the metabolism of chemicals, vitamins , fatty\\nacids, and hormones; it is very important in transformingtoxic substances into easily excretable materials. Inimmature red blood cells, heme is the featured componentof hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the red pigment that givesred blood cells their characteristic color and their essen-tial ability to transport oxygen.\\nHeme biosynthesis\\nThe heme molecule is composed of porphyrin and\\nan iron atom. Much of the heme biosynthesis pathway isdedicated to constructing the porphyrin molecule. Por-phyrin is a large molecule shaped like a four-leaf clover.An iron atom is placed at its center point in the last stepof heme biosynthesis.\\nThe production of heme may be compared to a fac-\\ntory assembly line. At the start of the line, raw materialsare fed into the process. At specific points along the line,an addition or adjustment is made to further develop-ment. Once additions and adjustments are complete, thefinal product rolls off the end of the line.\\nThe heme “assembly line” is an eight-step process,\\nrequiring eight different and properly functioningenzymes:\\n• delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase\\n• delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase• porphobilogen deaminase• uroporphyrinogen III cosynthase• uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase• coproporphyrinogen oxidase\\n• protoporphyrinogen oxidase\\n• ferrochelatase\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2670Porphyrias'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 377}, page_content='The control of heme biosynthesis is complex. Vari-\\nous chemical signals can trigger increased or decreasedproduction. These signals can affect the enzymes them-selves or the production of these enzymes, starting at thegenetic level. For example, one point at which hemebiosynthesis may be controlled is at the first step. Whenheme levels are low, greater quantities of delta-aminole-vulinic acid (ALA) synthase are produced. As a result,larger quantities of heme precursors are fed into thebiosynthesis pathway to step up heme production.\\nPorphyrias\\nUnder normal circumstances, when heme concentra-\\ntions are at an appropriate level, precursor productiondecreases. However, a glitch in the biosynthesis path-way—represented by a defective enzyme—means thatheme biosynthesis does not reach completion. Becauseheme levels remain low, the synthesis pathway continuesto churn out precursor molecules in an attempt to correctthe heme deficit.\\nThe net effect of this continued production is an\\nabnormal accumulation of precursor molecules anddevelopment of some type of porphyria. Each type ofporphyria corresponds with a specific enzyme defect andan accumulation of the associated precursor. Althoughthere are eight steps in heme biosynthesis, there are onlyseven types of porphyrias; a defect in ALA synthaseactivity does not have a corresponding porphyria.\\nEnzymes involved in heme biosynthesis display sub-\\ntle, tissue-specific variations; therefore, heme biosynthe-sis may be impeded in the liver, but normal in the imma-ture red blood cells, or vice versa. Incidence of porphyriavaries widely between types and occasionally by geo-graphic location. Although certain porphyrias are morecommon than others, their greater frequency is only rela-tive to other types. All porphyrias are considered to berare disorders.\\nIn the past, the porphyrias were divided into two gen-\\neral categories based on the location of the porphyrin pro-duction. Porphyrias affect heme biosynthesis in the liverwere referred to as hepatic porphyrias. Porphyrias thataffect heme biosynthesis in immature red blood cellswere referred to as erythropoietic porphyrias (erythro-poiesis is the process through which red blood cells areproduced). As of 2001, porphyrias are usually groupedinto acute and non-acute types. Acute porphyrias producesevere attacks of pain and neurological effects. Non-acute\\nporphyrias present as chronic diseases.\\nThe acute porphyrias, and the heme biosynthesis\\nsteps at which enzyme defects occur, are:• ALA dehydratase deficiency porphyria (step 2). This\\nporphyria type is very rare. The inheritance patternappears to be autosomal recessive. In autosomal reces-sively inherited disorders, a person must inherit twodefective genes, one from each parent. A parent withonly one gene for an autosomal recessive disorder doesnot display symptoms of the disease.\\n• Acute intermittent porphyria (step 3). Acute intermit-\\ntent porphyria (AIP) is also known as Swedish porphyr-ia, pyrroloporphyria, and intermittent acute porphyria.AIP is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, whichmeans that only one copy of the defective gene needs tobe present for the disorder to occur. Simply inheritingthis gene, however, does not necessarily mean that aperson will develop the disease. Approximately five to10 per 100,000 persons in the United States carry agene for AIP, but only 10% of these people ever devel-op symptoms of the disease.\\n• Hereditary coproporphyria (step 6). Hereditary copro-\\nporphyria (HCP) is inherited in an autosomal dominantmanner. As with all porphyrias, it is an uncommon ail-ment. By 1977, only 111 cases of HCP were recorded;in Denmark, the estimated incidence is two in one mil-lion people.\\n• Variegate porphyria (step 7). Variegate porphyria (VP)\\nis also known as porphyria variegata, protocopropor-phyria, South African genetic porphyria, and Royalmalady (supposedly King George III of England andMary, Queen of Scots, suffered from VP). VP is inherit-ed in an autosomal dominant manner and is especiallyprominent in South Africans of Dutch descent. Amongthat population, the incidence is approximately three in1,000 persons. It is estimated that there are 10,000cases of VP in South Africa. Interestingly, it appearsthat the affected South Africans are descendants of twoDutch settlers who came to South Africa in 1680.Among other populations, the incidence of VP is esti-mated to be one to two cases per 100,000 persons.\\nThe non-acute porphyrias, and the steps of heme\\nbiosynthesis at which they occur, are:\\n• Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (step 4). Congenital\\nerythropoietic porphyria (CEP) is also called Gunther’sdisease, erythropoietic porphyria, congenital porphyria,congenital hematoporphyria, and erythropoietic uropor-phyria. CEP is inherited in an autosomal recessive man-ner. It is a rare disease, estimated to affect fewer than onein one million people.

PCT may be acquired, typically as a result of\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2671Porphyrias'),\n",

PCT may also be inheritedas an autosomal dominant disorder, however most peo-ple remain latent—that is, symptoms never develop.PCT is the most common of the porphyrias, but theincidence of PCT is not well defined.\\n• Hepatoerythopoietic porphyria (step 5). Hepatoery-\\nthopoietic porphyria (HEP) affects heme biosynthesis inboth the liver and the bone marrow. HEP results from adefect in uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity (step5), and is caused by defects in the same gene as PCT.Disease symptoms, however, strongly resemble congeni-tal erythropoietic porphyria. HEP seems to be inheritedin an autosomal recessive manner.\\n• Erythropoietic protoporphyria (step 8). Also known as\\nprotoporphyria and erythrohepatic protoporphyria,erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is more commonthan CEP; more than 300 cases have been reported. Inthese cases, onset of symptoms typically occurred inchildhood.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nGeneral characteristics\\nThe underlying cause of all porphyrias is a defective\\nenzyme important to the heme biosynthesis pathway.Porphyrias are inheritable conditions. In virtually allcases of porphyria an inherited factor causes theenzyme’s defect. An environmental trigger—such asdiet, drugs, or sun exposure—may be necessary beforeany symptoms develop. In many cases, symptoms do notdevelop. These asymptomatic individuals may be com-pletely unaware that they have a gene for porphyria.\\nAll of the hepatic porphyrias—except porphyria\\ncutanea tarda—follow a pattern of acute attacks separat-ed by periods during which no symptoms are present.For this reason, this group is often referred to as the acuteporphyrias. The erythropoietic porphyrias and porphyriacutanea tarda do not follow this pattern and are consid-ered to be chronic conditions.\\nThe specific symptoms of each porphyria vary based\\non which enzyme is affected and whether that enzymeoccurs in the liver or in the bone marrow. The severity ofsymptoms can vary widely, even within the same type ofporphyria. If the porphyria becomes symptomatic, thecommon factor between all types is an abnormal accu-mulation of protoporphyrins or porphyrin.\\nALA dehydratase porphyria (ADP)\\nADP is characterized by a deficiency of ALA dehy-\\ndratase. ADP is caused by mutations in the delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase gene (ALAD) at 9q34. Of\\nthe few cases on record, the prominent symptoms arevomiting, pain in the abdomen, arms, and legs, and neu-ropathy. (Neuropathy refers to nerve damage that cancause pain, numbness, or paralysis.) The nerve damageassociated with ADP could cause breathing impairmentor lead to weakness or paralysis of the arms and legs.\\nAcute intermittent porphyria (AIP)\\nAIP is caused by a deficiency of porphobilogen\\ndeaminase, which occurs due to mutations in the hydrox-ymethylbilane synthase gene (HMBS) located at11q23.3. Symptoms of AIP usually do not occur unless aperson with the deficiency encounters a trigger sub-stance. Trigger substances can include hormones (forexample oral contraceptives , menstruation, pregnan-\\ncy), drugs, and dietary factors. Most people with this\\ndeficiency never develop symptoms.\\nAttacks occur after puberty and commonly feature\\nsevere abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipa-\\ntion. Muscle weakness and pain in the back, arms, and\\nlegs are also typical symptoms. During an attack, theurine is a deep reddish color. The central nervous systemmay also be involved. Possible psychological symptomsinclude hallucinations , confusion, seizures, and mood\\nchanges.\\nCongenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP)\\nCEP is caused by a deficiency of uroporphyrino-\\ngen III cosynthase due to mutations in the uropor-phyrinogen III cosynthase gene (UROS) located at10q25.2-q26.3. Symptoms are often apparent in infan-cy and include reddish urine and possibly an enlargedspleen. The skin is unusually sensitive to light and blis-ters easily if exposed to sunlight. (Sunlight inducesprotoporphyrin changes in the plasma and skin. Thesealtered protoporphyrin molecules can cause skin dam-age.) Increased hair growth is common. Damage fromrecurrent blistering and associated skin infections canbe severe. In some cases facial features and fingersmay be lost to recurrent damage and infection.Deposits of protoporphyrins can sometimes lead to redstaining of the teeth and bones.\\nPorphyria cutanea tarda (PCT)\\nPCT is caused by deficient uroporphyrinogen decar-\\nboxylase. PCT is caused by mutations in the uropor-phyrinogen decarboxylase gene (UROD) located at1p34. PCT may occur as an acquired or an inherited con-dition. The acquired form usually does not appear untiladulthood. The inherited form may appear in childhood,but often demonstrates no symptoms. Early symptoms\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2672Porphyrias'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 379}, page_content='include blistering on the hands, face, and arms following\\nminor injuries or exposure to sunlight. Lightening ordarkening of the skin may occur along with increasedhair growth or loss of hair. Liver function is abnormal butthe signs are mild.\\nHepatoerythopoietic porphyria (HEP)\\nHEP is linked to a deficiency of uroporphyrinogen\\ndecarboxylase in both the liver and the bone marrow.HEP is an autosomal recessive disease caused by muta-tions in the gene responsible for PCT, the uroporphyrino-gen decarboxylase gene (UROD), located at 1p34. Thegene is shared, but the mutations, inheritance, and specif-ic symptoms of these two diseases are different. Thesymptoms of HEP resemble those of CEP.\\nHereditary coproporphyria (HCP)\\nHCP is similar to AIP, but the symptoms are typical-\\nly milder. HCP is caused by a deficiency of copropor-phyrinogen oxidase due to mutations in a gene by thesame name at 3q12. The greatest difference betweenHCP and AIP is that people with HCP may have someskin sensitivity to sunlight. However, extensive damageto the skin is rarely seen.\\nV ariegate porphyria (VP)\\nVP is caused by a deficiency of protoporphyrinogen\\noxidase. There is scientific evidence that VP is caused bymutation in the gene for protoporphyrinogen oxidaselocated at 1q22. Like AIP, symptoms of VP occur onlyduring attacks. Major symptoms of this type of porphyriainclude neurological problems and sensitivity to light.Areas of the skin that are exposed to sunlight are suscep-tible to burning, blistering, and scarring.\\nErythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP)\\nOwing to deficient ferrochelatase, the last step in\\nthe heme biosynthesis pathway—the insertion of an ironatom into a porphyrin molecule—cannot be completed.This enzyme deficiency is caused by mutations in theferrochelatase gene (FECH) located at 18q21.3. Themajor symptoms of this disorder are related to sensitivi-ty to light—including both artificial and natural lightsources. Following exposure to light, a person with EPPexperiences burning, itching , swelling, and reddening of\\nthe skin. Blistering and scarring may occur but are nei-ther common nor severe. EPP is associated withincreased risks for gallstones and liver complications.\\nSymptoms can appear in childhood and tend to be moresevere during the summer when exposure to sunlight ismore likely.Diagnosis\\nDepending on the array of symptoms an individual\\nmay exhibit, the possibility of porphyria may not imme-diately come to a physician’s mind. In the absence of afamily history of porphyria, non-specific symptoms,such as abdominal pain and vomiting, may be attributedto other disorders. Neurological symptoms, includingconfusion and hallucinations, can lead to an initial sus-picion of psychiatric disease. Diagnosis is more easilyaccomplished in cases in which non-specific symptomsappear in combination with symptoms more specific toporphyria, like neuropathy, sensitivity to sunlight, orcertain other manifestations. Certain symptoms, such asurine the color of port wine, are hallmark signs very spe-cific to porphyria. DNA analysis is not yet of routinediagnostic value.\\nA common initial test measures protoporphyrins in\\nthe urine. However, if skin sensitivity to light is a symp-tom, a blood plasma test is indicated. If these testsreveal abnormal levels of protoporphyrins, further testsare done to measure heme precursor levels in red bloodcells and the stool. The presence and estimated quantityof porphyrin and protoporphyrins in biological samplesare easily detected using spectrofluorometric testing.Spectrofluorometric testing uses a spectrofluorometerthat directs light of a specific strength at a fluid sample.The porphyrins and protoporphyrins in the sampleabsorb the light energy and fluoresce, or glow. Thespectrofluorometer detects and measures fluorescence,which indicates the amount of porphyrins and protopor-phyrins in the sample.\\nWhether heme precursors occur in the blood,\\nurine, or stool gives some indication of the type of por-phyria, but more detailed biochemical testing isrequired to determine their exact identity. Making thisdetermination yields a strong indicator of whichenzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway is defective;which, in turn, allows a diagnosis of the particular typeof porphyria.\\nBiochemical tests rely on the color, chemical proper-\\nties, and other unique features of each heme precursor.For example, a screening test for acute intermittent por-phyria (AIP) is the Watson-Schwartz test. In this test, aspecial dye is added to a urine sample. If one of twoheme precursors—porphobilinogen or urobilinogen—ispresent, the sample turns pink or red. Further testing isnecessary to determine whether the precursor present isporphobilinogen or urobilinogen—only porphobilinogenis indicative of AIP.\\nOther biochemical tests rely on the fact that heme\\nprecursors become less soluble in water (able to be dis-solved in water) as they progress further through the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2673Porphyrias'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 380}, page_content='heme biosynthesis pathway. For example, to determine\\nwhether the Watson-Schwartz urine test is positive forporphobilinogen or urobilinogen, chloroform is added tothe test tube. Chloroform is a water-insoluble substance.Even after vigorous mixing, the water and chloroformseparate into two distinct layers. Urobilinogen is slightlyinsoluble in water, while porphobilinogen tends to bewater-soluble. The porphobilinogen mixes more readilyin water than chloroform, so if the water layer is pink(from the dye added to the urine sample), that indicatesthe presence of porphobilinogen, and a diagnosis of AIPis probable.\\nAs a final test, measuring specific enzymes and\\ntheir activities may be done for some types of porphyr-ias; however, such tests are not done as a screeningmethod. Certain enzymes, such as porphobilinogendeaminase (the defective enzyme in AIP), can be easilyextracted from red blood cells; other enzymes, however,are less readily collected or tested. Basically, anenzyme test involves adding a certain amount of theenzyme to a test tube that contains the precursor it issupposed to modify. Both the production of modifiedprecursor and the rate at which it appears can be mea-sured using laboratory equipment. If a modified precur-sor is produced, the test indicates that the enzyme isdoing its job. The rate at which the modified precursoris produced can be compared to a standard to measurethe efficiency of the enzyme.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for porphyria revolves around avoiding\\nacute attacks, limiting potential effects, and treatingsymptoms. Treatment options vary depending on the spe-cific type of porphyria diagnosed. Gene therapy has\\nbeen successful for both CEP and EPP. In the future, sci-entists expect development of gene therapy for theremaining porphyrias. Given the rarity of ALA dehy-dratase porphyria, definitive treatment guidelines for thisrare type have not been developed.\\nAcute intermittent porphyria, hereditary\\ncoproporphyria, and variegate porphyria\\nTreatment for acute intermittent porphyria, heredi-\\ntary coproporphyria, and variegate porphyria followsthe same basic regime. A person who has been diag-nosed with one of these porphyrias can prevent mostattacks by avoiding precipitating factors, such as certaindrugs that have been identified as triggers for acute por-phyria attacks. Individuals must maintain adequatenutrition , particularly with respect to carbohydrates. In\\nsome cases, an attack can be stopped by increasing car-bohydrate consumption or by receiving carbohydrates\\nintravenously.\\nWhen attacks occur prompt medical attention is nec-\\nessary. Pain is usually severe, and narcotic analgesics are\\nthe best option for relief. Phenothiazines can be used tocounter nausea, vomiting, and anxiety , and chloral\\nhydrate or diazepam is useful for sedation or to induce\\nsleep. Hematin, a drug administered intravenously, maybe used to halt an attack. Hematin seems to work by sig-naling the pathway of heme biosynthesis to slow produc-tion of precursors. Women, who tend to develop symp-toms more frequently than men owing to hormonal fluc-tuations, may find ovulation-inhibiting hormone therapyto be helpful.\\nGene therapy is a possible future treatment for these\\nporphyrias. An experimental animal model of AIP hasbeen developed and research is in progress.\\nCongenital erythropoietic porphyria\\nThe key points of congenital erythropoietic por-\\nphyria treatment are avoiding exposure to sunlight andprevention of skin trauma or skin infection. Liberal useof sunscreens and consumption of beta-carotene sup-\\nplements can provide some protection from sun-induced damage. Medical treatments such as removingthe spleen or administering transfusions of red bloodcells can create short-term benefits, but these treatmentsdo not offer a cure. Remission can sometimes beachieved after treatment with oral doses of activatedcharcoal. Severely affected patients may be offeredbone marrow transplantation which appears to confer\\nlong-term benefit.\\nPorphyria cutanea tarda\\nAs with other porphyrias, the first line of defense is\\navoidance of factors, especially alcohol, that could bringabout symptoms. Regular blood withdrawal is a proventherapy for pushing symptoms into remission. If an indi-vidual is anemic or cannot have blood drawn for otherreasons, chloroquine therapy may be used.\\nErythropoietic protoporphyria\\nAvoiding sunlight, using sunscreens, and taking\\nbeta-carotene supplements are typical treatment optionsfor erythropoietic protoporphyria. The drug cholestyra-mine may reduce the skin’s sensitivity to sunlight aswell as the accumulated heme precursors in the liver.Liver transplantation has been used in cases of liver\\nfailure, but it has not effected a long-term cure of theporphyria.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2674Porphyrias'),\n",

It is performed when pres-sure in the portal vein is so high that it causes internalbleeding from blood vessels in the esophagus.\\nPurpose\\nThe portal vein carries blood from the stomach\\nand abdominal organs to the liver. It is a major veinthat splits into many branches. High pressure in theportal vein causes swelling and bleeding from bloodvessels in the esophagus. This situation occurs whenthe liver is damaged from cirrhosis of the liver, a con-\\ndition usually caused by prolonged, excessive alcoholconsumption.\\nMassive internal bleeding caused by high pressure in\\nthe portal vein occurs in about 40% of patients with cir-rhosis. It is initially fatal in at least half of these patients.Patients who survive are likely to experience bleedingrecurrence. Portal vein bypass, also called portacavalshunting, is performed on these surviving patients to con-trol bleeding.Precautions\\nMost patients who need portal vein bypass surgery\\nnot only have liver disease and poor liver function, butalso suffer from an enlarged spleen, jaundice , and dam-\\nage to the vascular system brought on by years of alco-\\nholism . They are likely to experience serious complica-\\ntions during surgery. Some patients are aggressivelyuncooperative with medical personnel. Under these con-ditions, half the patients may not survive the operation.\\nDescription\\nA choice of portal vein bypasses is available. Portal\\nvein bypass is usually performed as an emergency oper-ation in a hospital under general anesthesia. The sur-geon makes an abdominal incision and finds the portalvein. In portacaval shunting, blood from the portal veinis diverted into the inferior vena cava. This is the mostcommon bypass. In splenorenal shunting, the splenicvein (a part of the portal vein), is connected to the renalvein. A mesocaval shunt connects the superior mesen-teric vein (another part of the portal vein) to the inferiorvena cava.\\nPortal pressure can also be reduced in a procedure\\ncalled transvenous intrahepatic portosystemic shunt(TIPS). A catheter is threaded into the portal vein, andan expandable balloon or wire mesh is inserted todivert blood from the portal vein to the hepatic vein.The rate of serious complications in TIPS is only1–2%. The operation cannot be performed at all hospi-tals, but is becoming the preferred treatment for reduc-ing portal pressure.\\nPreparation\\nStandard preoperative blood and urine tests are per-\\nformed, and liver function is evaluated. The heart andarterial blood pressure are monitored both during andafter the operation.\\nAftercare\\nThe patient will be connected to a heart monitor and\\nfed through a nasogastric tube. Vital functions are moni-tored through blood and urine tests. Patients receive pain\\nmedication and antibiotics .

The process of ending ovulation and menstruationis gradual, spanning one to two years.\\nPostmenopausal bleeding is bleeding that occurs\\nafter menopause has been established for at least sixmonths. It is different from infrequent, irregular periods(oligomenorrhea ) that occur around the time of\\nmenopause.\\nMany women experience some postmenopausal\\nbleeding. However, postmenopausal bleeding is not nor-mal. Because it can be a symptom of a serious medicalcondition, any episodes of postmenopausal bleedingshould be brought to the attention of a woman’s doctor.\\nWomen taking estrogen (called hormone replace-\\nment therapy or HRT) are more likely to experience\\npostmenopausal bleeding.

Bleeding from the vagi-na may occur because when estrogen secretion stops, thevagina dries out and can diminish (atrophy).

The estrogen in the replacement ther-apy eases the symptoms of menopause (like hot flash-es), and decreases the risk of osteoporosis . Sometimes\\nthis supplemental estrogen stimulates the uterine lin-ing to grow. When the lining is shed, postmenopausalbleeding occurs. Most women on HRT usually take thehormone progesterone with the estrogen, and mayhave monthly withdrawal bleeding. This is a normalside effect.\\nAbout 5–10% of postmenopausal bleeding is due to\\nendometrial cancer or its precursors. Uterine hyperplasia,the abnormal growth of uterine cells, can be a precursorto cancer.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of postmenopausal bleeding begins with\\nthe patient. The doctor will ask for a detailed history ofhow long postmenopausal bleeding has occurred. Awoman can assist the doctor by keeping a record of thetime, frequency, length, and quantity of bleeding. Sheshould also tell the doctor about any medications she istaking, especially any estrogens or steroids.\\nAfter taking the woman’s history, the doctor does a\\npelvic examination and PAP test . The doctor will exam-\\nine the vulva and vagina for any signs of atrophy, andwill feel for any sign of uterine polyps. Depending on theresults of this examination, the doctor may want to domore extensive testing.\\nInvasive diagnostic procedures\\nEndometrial biopsy allows the doctor to sample\\nsmall areas of the uterine lining, while cervical biopsyallows the cervix to be sampled. Tissues are then examinedfor any abnormalities. This is a simple office procedure.\\nDilatation and curettage (D & C) is often neces-\\nsary for definitive diagnosis. This is done under eithergeneral or local anesthesia. After examining the tissuescollected by an endometrial biopsy or D & C, the doctormay order additional tests to determine if an estrogen-secreting tumor is present on the ovaries or in anotherpart of the body.\\nNon-invasive diagnostic procedures\\nWith concerns about the rising cost of health care,\\nvaginal probe ultrasound is increasingly being used morethan endometrial biopsy to evaluate women with post-menopausal bleeding. Vaginal ultrasound measures thethickness of the endometrium. When the endometrialstripe is less than 0.2 in (5 mm) thick, the chance of can-\\ncer is less than 1%. The disadvantage of vaginal ultra-sound is that it often does not show polyps and fibroidsin the uterus.\\nA refinement of vaginal probe ultrasound is saline\\ninfusion sonography (SIS). A salt water (saline) solutionis injected into the uterus with a small tube (catheter)before the vaginal probe is inserted. The presence of liq-uid in the uterus helps make any structural abnormalitiesmore distinct. These two non-invasive procedures causeless discomfort than endometrial biopsies and D & Cs,but D & C still remains the definitive test for diagnosinguterine cancer.\\nTreatment\\nIt is common for women just beginning HRT to\\nexperience some bleeding. Most women who are on HRTalso take progesterone with the estrogen and may havemonthly withdrawal bleeding. Again, this is a normalside effect that usually does not require treatment.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2680Postmenopausal bleedingKEY TERMS\\nDilatation and curettage (D & C) —A procedure\\nperformed under anesthesia during which thecervix is opened more (or dilated) and tissue liningthe uterus is scraped out with a metal, spoon-shaped instrument or a suction tube.

Mild to moderate cases are some-times unrecognized by women themselves. Many womenfeel ashamed if they are not coping and so may concealtheir difficulties. This is a serious problem that disruptswomen’s lives and can have effects on the baby, otherchildren, her partner, and other relationships. Levels ofdepression for fathers also increase significantly.\\nPostpartum depression is often divided into two types:\\nearly onset and late onset. An early onset most often seemslike the “blues,” a mild brief experience during the firstdays or weeks after birth. During the first week after thebirth up to 80% of mothers will experience the “babyblues.” This is usually a time of extra sensitivity and symp-toms include tearfulness, irritability, anxiety , and mood\\nchanges, which tend to peak between three to five daysafter childbirth. The symptoms normally disappear withintwo weeks without requiring specific treatment apart fromunderstanding, support, skill, and practice. In short, somedepression, tiredness, and anxiety may fall within the “nor-mal” range of reactions to giving birth.\\nLate onset appears several weeks after the birth. This\\ninvolves a slowly growing feeling of sadness, depression,lack of energy, chronic tiredness, inability to sleep,change in appetite, significant weight loss or gain, anddifficulty caring for the baby.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAs of 2001, experts cannot say what causes postpar-\\ntum depression. Most likely, it is caused by many factorsthat vary from individual to individual. Mothers com-monly experience some degree of depression during thefirst weeks after birth. Pregnancy and birth are accompa-nied by sudden hormonal changes that affect emotions.Additionally, the 24-hour responsibility for a newborninfant represents a major psychological and lifestyleadjustment for most mothers, even after the first child.These physical and emotional stresses are usuallyaccompanied by inadequate rest until the baby’s routinestabilizes, so fatigue and depression are not unusual.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2681Postpartum depression'),\n",

Oneeffective treatment combines antidepressant medicationand psychotherapy. These types of medication are ofteneffective when used for three to four weeks. Any medica-tion use must be carefully considered if the woman arebreast-feeding, but with some medications, continuingbreast-feeding is safe. Nevertheless, medication alone isnever sufficient and should always be accompanied bycounseling or other support services.\\nAlternative treatment\\nPostpartum depression can be effectively alleviated\\nthrough counseling and support groups, so that themother doesn’t feel she is alone in her feelings.

PPS occurs about 20–30years after the original bout with polio, and causes slow\\nbut progressive weakening of muscles.\\nDescription\\nPolio is a disease caused by the poliovirus. It most\\ncommonly infects younger children, although it can alsoinfect older children and adults. About 90% of peopleinfected by poliovirus develop only a mild case or no ill-ness at all. However, infected people can continue tospread the virus to others. In its most severe form poliocauses paralysis of the muscles of the legs, arms, and\\nrespiratory system.\\nAbout 1% of all people infected with poliovirus\\ndevelop the actual disease known as polio. In these cases,the virus (which enters the person’s body through themouth) multiplies rapidly within the intestine. The virus-es then invade the nearby lymphatic system. Eventually,poliovirus enters the bloodstream, which allows it to gainaccess to the central nervous system or CNS (the brainand spinal cord). The virus may actually infect a nerveelsewhere in the body, and then spread along that nerveto enter the brain.\\nThe major illness associated with poliovirus often\\nfollows a mild illness, which has symptoms of fever ,\\nnausea, and vomiting. However, after a symptom-freeinterval of several days, the patient who is on the way toa major illness develops new symptoms such asheadache and back and neck pain . These symptoms are\\ndue to invasion of the nervous system. The motor nerves(those nerves responsible for movement of the muscles)become inflamed, injured, and destroyed. The muscles,therefore, no longer receive any messages from the brainor spinal cord. The muscles become weak, floppy, andthen totally paralyzed (unable to move). All muscle toneis lost in the affected limb, and the muscle begins todecrease in size (atrophy). The affected muscles areoften only on one side (asymmetric paralysis) of thebody. Sensation (the person’s ability to feel) is notaffected in these paralyzed limbs.\\nThe maximum state of paralysis is usually reached\\nwithin just a few days. The remaining, unaffected nervesthen begin the process of attempting to grow branches tocompensate (make up for) the destroyed nerves. Thisprocess continues for about six months. Whatever func-tion has not been regained in this amount of time willusually be permanently lost.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPPS occurs in about 25% of patients, several\\ndecades after their original infection with polio. Howev-er, long-term follow-up indicates that two thirds of polio\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2683Postpolio syndrome'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 390}, page_content='survivors may experience new weakness. Several theo-\\nries exist as to the cause of this syndrome.\\nOne such theory has looked at the way function is\\nregained by polio survivors. Three mechanisms seem tobe at work:\\n• injured nerves recuperate and begin functioning again\\n• muscles which still have working nerve connections\\ngrow in size and strength, in order to take over for otherparalyzed muscles\\n• working nerves begin to send small branches out to\\nmuscles whose original nerves were destroyed by polio\\nAs a person ages, injured nerves that were able to\\nregain function may fail again, as may muscles that havebeen over-worked for years in order to compensate forother paralyzed muscles. Even the uninjured nerves thatprovided new nerve twigs to the muscles may begin to fal-ter after years of relative over-activity. This theory, then,suggests that the body’s ability to compensate for destroyednerves may eventually begin to fail. The compensatingnerves and muscles grow older, and because they’ve beenworking so much harder over the years, they wear out rela-tively sooner than would be expected of normal nerves andmuscles. Some researchers look at this situation as a formof premature aging , brought on by overuse.\\nOther researchers note that normal aging includes\\nthe loss of a fair number of motor nerves. When a patienthas already lost motor nerves through polio, normal lossof motor nerves through aging may cause the number ofremaining working nerves to drop low enough to causesymptoms of weakness.\\nOther theories of PPS include the possibility that\\nparticles of the original polioviruses remain in the body.These particles may exert a negative effect, decades later,or they may cause the body’s immune system to producesubstances originally intended to fight the invading virus,but which may accidentally set off a variety of reactionswithin the body that actually serve to interfere with thenormal functioning of the nerves and muscles.\\nStill other researchers are looking at the possibility\\nthat polio patients have important spinal cord changeswhich, over time, affect the nerves responsible for move-ment.\\nThe symptoms of PPS include generalized fatigue ,\\nlow energy, progressively increasing muscle weakness,shrinking muscle size (atrophy), involuntary twitching ofthe muscle fibers (fasciculations), painful muscles andjoints, difficulties with breathing and swallowing, andsleep problems.Survivors of polio may also develop arthritis of the\\nspine, shoulders, or arms, related to the long-term use ofcrutches or overcompensation for weak leg muscles.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is primarily through history. When a\\npatient who has recovered from polio some decades pre-viously begins to experience muscle weakness, PPS mustbe strongly suspected.\\nTreatment\\nJust as there are no treatments available to reverse\\nthe original damage of polio, there are also no treatmentsavailable to reverse the damaging effects of postpoliosyndrome. Attempts can be made to relieve some of thesymptoms, however.\\nPain and inflammation of the muscles and joints can\\nbe treated with anti-inflammatory medications, applica-tion of hot packs, stretching exercises, and physical ther-apy. Exercises to maintain/increase flexibility are partic-ularly important. However, an exercise regimen must be\\ncarefully designed, so as not to strain already fatiguedmuscles and nerves.\\nSome patients will require new types of braces to\\nprovide support for weakening muscles. Others will needto use wheelchairs or motorized scooters to maintainmobility.\\nSleep problems and respiratory difficulties may be\\nrelated to each other. If breathing is labored during sleep,the blood’s oxygen content may drop low enough tointerfere with the quality of sleep. This may require oxy-gen supplementation, or even the use of a machine to aidin breathing.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis for patients with postpolio syndrome is\\nrelatively good. It is a very slow, gradually progressingsyndrome. Only about 20% of all patients with PPS willneed to rely on new aids for mobility or breathing. Itappears that the PPS symptoms reach their most severeabout 30–34 years after original diagnosis of polio.\\nPrevention\\nThere is no way to prevent PPS. However, paying\\nattention to what types of exertion worsen symptomsmay slow the progression of the syndrome.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2684Postpolio syndrome'),\n",

PTSD is characterized byupsetting memories or thoughts of the ordeal, “blunting”of emotions, increased arousal, and sometimes severepersonality changes.\\nDescription\\nOnce called “shell shock” or battle fatigue, PTSD is\\nmost well known as a problem of war veterans returningfrom the battlefield. However, it can affect anyone whohas experienced a traumatic event, such as rape, robbery,a natural disaster, or a serious accident. A diagnosis of aserious disease can trigger PTSD in some people. Con-sidered to be one of a group of conditions known as“anxiety disorders,” it can affect people of all ages whohave experienced severe trauma. Children who haveexperienced severe trauma, such as war, a natural disas-ter, sexual or physical abuse , or the death of a parent,\\nare also prone to PTSD.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPTSD is a response to a profoundly disturbing\\nevent. It isn’t clear why some people develop PTSDfollowing a trauma and others do not, although expertssuspect it may be influenced both by the severity of theevent, by the person’s personality and genetic make-up, and by whether or not the trauma was expected. Asthe individual struggles to cope with life after theevent, ordinary events or situations reminiscent of thetrauma often trigger frightening and vivid memories or“flashbacks.” Symptoms usually begin within threemonths of the trauma, although sometimes PTSD does-n’t develop until years after the initial trauma occurred.Once the symptoms begin, they may fade away againwithin six months. Others suffer with the symptoms forfar longer and in some cases, the problem may becomechronic. Some untreated Vietnam veterans with PTSD,for example, spent decades living alone in rural areasof the country, struggling to come to grips with thehorror of war.\\nAmong the most troubling symptoms of PTSD are\\nflashbacks, which can be triggered by sounds, smells,feelings, or images.

Sleep disorders such as night-\\nmares or night terrors , or difficulty falling asleep may\\noccur. Intense distress may be experienced whenexposed to events that are associated with the trauma.Avoidance of thoughts surrounding the trauma orinability to remember the event and the accompanyingemotions may also arise. Loss of interest in formerpleasures (psychic numbing or blunting) or a sense of ashortened future may also be present. Startle reactions(hyper-alertness and strong reactions to unexpectednoises), memory and concentration problems, moodi-ness, and violence may also be symptomatic. Childrenwith PTSD may experience learning disabilities andmemory or attention problems. They may become moredependent, anxious, or even self-abusing. Major depres-sion, anxiety disorders , substance abuse, adjustment\\ndisorder, development of hypochondria disorders, andorganic brain disorders may be some of the psychiatricmanifestations of exposure to traumatic stress. Recov-ery may be slowed by injuries, damage to property, lossof employment, or other major problems in the commu-nity due to disaster.\\nDiagnosis\\nNot every person who experiences a traumatic event\\nwill experience PTSD. A mental health professional willdiagnose the condition if the symptoms of stress last formore than a month after a traumatic event. While a for-mal diagnosis of PTSD is made only in the wake of asevere trauma, it is possible to have a mild PTSD-likereaction following less severe stress.Treatment\\nSeveral factors have been shown to be important in\\nthe treatment of post-traumatic stress. These includeproximity of the treatment to the site of the event, imme-diate intervention of therapy as soon as possible, and theexpectation that the individual will eventually return tomore normal functions. The most helpful treatmentappears to be a combination of medication along withsupportive and cognitive-behavioral therapies.\\nMedications\\nMedications used to reduce the symptoms of PTSD\\ninclude anxiety-reducing medications and antidepres-sants, especially the selective serotonin reuptake\\ninhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine (Prozac). Sleep\\nproblems can be lessened with brief treatment with ananti-anxiety drug, such as a benzodiazepine like alprazo-lam (Xanax), but long-term usage can lead to disturbingside effects, such as increased anger, drug tolerance,dependency, and abuse.\\nTherapy\\nSeveral types of therapy may be useful and they are\\noften combined in a multi-faceted approach to under-stand and treat this condition.\\n• Psychological debriefing may be used as facts are\\nrecounted. Impressions, thoughts, and emotions areexpressed. These responses are then validated and con-firmed to be normal in response to an abnormal situa-tion. The therapist conducting the debriefing may rec-ommend coping skills.\\n• Psychotherapy can help reduce negative thought pat-\\nterns and self talk. This can be done on an individualbasis or in groups with other PTSD sufferers. Family\\ntherapy can also be helpful.\\n•Cognitive-behavioral therapy focuses on changing\\nspecific actions and thoughts.\\n• Spiritual healing may also be employed and has been\\nuseful in some cases.\\nAlternative treatment\\nSeveral means of alternative treatment may be help-\\nful in combination with conventional therapy for reduc-tion of the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.These include relaxation training, breathing techniques,spiritual treatment, and drama therapy, in which the eventis re-enacted.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2686Post-traumatic stress disorderKEY TERMS\\nBenzodiazepine —A class of drugs that have a\\nhypnotic and sedative action, used mainly as tran-quilizers to control symptoms of anxiety.\\nCognitive-behavioral therapy —A type of psy-\\nchotherapy used to treat anxiety disorders (includingPTSD) that emphasizes behavioral change, togetherwith alteration of negative thought patterns.\\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) —A\\nclass of antidepressants that work by blocking thereabsorption of serotonin in the brain, raising thelevels of serotonin.

The genetic basis of PWS is complex.Characteristics of the syndrome include developmentaldelay, poor muscle tone, short stature, small hands andfeet, incomplete sexual development, and unique facialfeatures. Insatiable appetite is a classic feature of PWS.This uncontrollable appetite can lead to health problemsand behavior disturbances.\\nDescription\\nThe first patients with features of PWS were\\ndescribed by Dr. Prader, Dr. Willi, and Dr. Lambert in1956. Since that time, the complex genetic basis ofPWS has begun to be understood. Initially, scientistsfound that individuals with PWS have a portion ofgenetic material deleted (erased) from chromosome 15.In order to have PWS, the genetic material must bedeleted from the chromosome 15 received from one’sfather. If the deletion is on the chromosome 15 inherit-ed from one’s mother a different syndrome develops.This was an important discovery. It demonstrated forthe first time that the genes inherited from one’s mothercan be expressed differently than the genes inheritedfrom one’s father.\\nOver time, scientists realized that some individuals\\nwith PWS do not have deleted genetic material fromchromosome 15. Further studies found that these patientsinherit both copies of chromosome 15 from their mother.This is not typical. Normally, an individual receives onechromosome 15 from their father and one chromosome15 from their mother. When a person receives both chro-mosomes from the same parent it is called “uniparentaldisomy.” When a person receives both chromosomesfrom his or her mother it is called “maternal uniparentaldisomy.”\\nScientists are still discovering other causes of\\nPWS. A small number of patients with PWS have achange (mutation) in the genetic material on the chro-mosome 15 inherited from their father. This mutationprevents certain genes on chromosome 15 from work-ing properly. PWS develops when these genes do notwork normally.\\nNewborns with PWS generally have poor muscle\\ntone (hypotonia) and do not feed well. This can lead topoor weight gain and failure to thrive .

These unique facial\\nfeatures are typically subtle and detectable only byphysicians.\\nAs children with PWS age, development is typically\\nslower than normal. Developmental milestones, such ascrawling, walking and talking occur later than usual.Developmental delay continues into adulthood forapproximately 50% of individuals with PWS. At aboutone to two years of age, children with PWS develop anuncontrollable, insatiable appetite. Left to their owndevices, individuals with PWS will eat until they sufferfrom life-threatening obesity . The desire to eat can lead\\nto significant behavior problems.\\nThe symptoms and features of PWS require life long\\nsupport and care. If food intake is strictly monitored andvarious therapies provided, individuals with PWS have anormal life expectancy.\\nPWS affects approximately 1 in 10,000 to 25,000\\nlive births. It is the most common genetic cause of life-threatening obesity. It affects both males and females.PWS can be seen in all races and ethnic groups.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn order to comprehend the various causes of PWS,\\nthe nature of chromosomes and genes must be wellunderstood. Human beings have 46 chromosomes in thecells of their body. Chromosomes contain genes, whichregulate the function and development of the body. Anindividual’s chromosomes are inherited from his or herparents. Each parent normally gives a child 23 chromo-somes. A child normally receives 23 chromosomes fromthe egg and 23 chromosomes from the sperm.\\nThe 46 chromosomes in the human body are divided\\ninto pairs based on their physical characteristics. Eachpair is assigned a number or a letter. When viewed undera microscope, chromosomes within the same pair appearidentical because they contain the same genes.\\nMost chromosomes have a constriction near the cen-\\nter called the centromere. The centromere separates thechromosome into long and short arms. The short arm of achromosome is called the “p arm,” the long arm is calledthe “q arm.”\\nChromosomes in the same pair contain the same\\ngenes. However, some genes work differently dependingon if they were inherited from the egg or the sperm.Sometimes, genes are silenced when inherited from themother. Other times, genes are silenced when inheritedfrom the father. When genes in a certain region on achromosome are silenced, they are said to be “imprint-ed.” Imprinting is a normal process that does not typical-ly cause disease. If normal imprinting is disrupted a\\ngenetic disease can develop.\\nIndividuals have two complete copies of chromo-\\nsome 15. One chromosome 15 is inherited from themother, or “maternal” in origin. The other chromosome15 is inherited from the father, or “paternal” in origin.\\nChromosome 15 contains many different genes.\\nThere are several genes found on the q arm of chromo-some 15 that are imprinted. A gene called “SNPRN” isan example of one of these genes. It is normally imprint-ed, or silenced, if inherited from the mother. The imprint-ing of this group of maternal genes does not typicallycause disease. The genes in this region should not beimprinted if paternal in origin. Normal developmentdepends on these paternal genes being present and active.If these genes are deleted, not inherited, or incorrectlyimprinted PWS develops.\\nSeventy percent of the cases of PWS are caused when\\na piece of material is deleted, or erased, from the paternalchromosome 15. This deletion occurs in a specific regionon the q arm of chromosome 15. The piece of chromoso-mal material that is deleted contains genes that must bepresent for normal development. These paternal genesmust be working normally, because the same genes on thechromosome 15 inherited from the mother are imprinted.When these paternal genes are missing, the brain and otherparts of the body do not develop as expected. This is whatcauses the symptoms associated with PWS.\\nIn 99% of the cases of PWS the deletion is sporadic.\\nThis means that it happens randomly and there is not anapparent cause. It does not run in the family. If a childhas PWS due to a sporadic deletion in the paternal chro-mosome 15, the chance the parents could have anotherchild with PWS is less than 1%. In fewer than 1% of thecases of PWS there is a chromosomal rearrangement inthe family which causes the deletion. This chromosomalrearrangement is called a “translocation.” If a parent hasa translocation the risk of having a child with PWS ishigher than 1%.\\nPWS can also develop if a child receives both chro-\\nmosome 15s from his or her mother. This is seen inapproximately 25% of the cases of PWS. Maternal uni-parental disomy for chromosome 15 leads to PWSbecause the genes on chromosome 15 that should havebeen inherited from the father are missing, and the geneson both the chromosome 15s inherited from the motherare imprinted.\\nPWS caused by maternal uniparental is sporadic.\\nThis means that it occurs randomly and there is not anapparent cause. If a child has PWS due to maternal uni-parental disomy the chance the parents could have anoth-er child with PWS is less than 1%.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2688Prader-Willi syndrome'),\n",

This mutation leads to incorrect imprinting.This mutation causes genes inherited from the father tobe imprinted or silenced, which should not normally beimprinted. If a child has PWS due to a mutation thatchanges imprinting, the chance the parents could haveanother child with PWS is approximately 5%.\\nInfants with PWS have weak muscle tone (hypoto-\\nnia). This hypotonia causes problems with sucking andeating. Infants with PWS may have problems gainingweight. Some infants with PWS are diagnosed with “fail-ure to thrive” due to slow growth and development. Dur-ing infancy, babies with PWS may also sleep more thannormal and have problems controlling their temperature.\\nSome of the unique physical features associated\\nwith PWS can be seen during infancy. Genitalia that issmaller than normal is common. This may be more evi-dent in males with PWS. Hands and feet may also besmaller than average. The unique facial features seen insome patients with PWS may be difficult to detect ininfancy. These facial features are very mild and do notcause physical problems.\\nAs early as 6 months, but more commonly between\\none to two years a compulsive desire to eat develops.This uncontrollable appetite is a classic feature of PWS.Individuals with PWS lack the ability to feel full or sati-ated. This uncontrollable desire to eat is thought to berelated to a difference in the brain, which controlshunger. Over-eating (hyperpahgia), a lack of a desire toexercise , and a slow metabolism places individuals with\\nPWS at high risk for severe obesity. Some individualswith PWS may also have a reduced ability to vomit.\\nBehavior problems are a common feature of PWS.\\nSome behavior problems develop from the desire to eat.Other reported problems include obsessive/compulsivebehaviors, depression, and temper tantrums. Individualswith PWS may also pick their own skin (skin picking).This unusual behavior may be due to a reduced pain\\nthreshold.\\nDevelopmental delay, learning disabilities, and\\nmental retardation are associated with PWS. Approxi-\\nmately 50% of individuals with PWS have developmen-tal delay. The remaining 50% are described as havingmild mental retardation. The mental retardation canoccasionally be more severe. Infants and children withPWS are often delayed in development.\\nPuberty may occur early or late, but it is usually\\nincomplete. In addition to the effects on sexual developmentand fertility, individuals do not undergo the normal adoles-cent growth spurt and may be short as adults. Muscles oftenremain underdeveloped and body fat is increased.Diagnosis\\nDuring infancy the diagnosis of PWS may be sus-\\npected if poor muscle tone, feeding problems, small gen-italia, or the unique facial features are present. If aninfant has these features, testing for PWS should be per-formed. This testing should also be offered to childrenand adults who display features commonly seen in PWS(developmental delay, uncontrollable appetite, small gen-italia, etc.). There are several different genetic tests thatcan detect PWS. All of these tests can be performed froma blood sample.\\nMethylation testing detects 99% of the cases of\\nPWS. Methylation testing can detect the absence of thepaternal genes that should be normally active on chromo-some 15. Although methylation testing can accuratelydiagnose PWS, it can not determine if the PWS is causedby a deletion, maternal uniparental disomy, or a mutationthat disrupts imprinting. This information is importantfor genetic counseling . Therefore, additional testing\\nshould be performed.\\nChromosome analysis can determine if the PWS is\\nthe result of a deletion in the q arm of chromosome 15.Chromosome analysis, also called “karyotyping,” involvesstaining the chromosomes and examining them under amicroscope. In some cases the deletion of material fromchromosome 15 can be easily seen. In other cases, furthertesting must be performed. FISH (fluorescence in-situhybridization) is a special technique that detects smalldeletions that cause PWS.\\nMore specialized DNA testing is required to detect\\nmaternal uniparental disomy or a mutation that disruptsimprinting. This DNA testing identifies unique DNA pat-terns in the mother and father. The unique DNA patternsare then compared with the DNA from the child withPWS.\\nPWS can be detected before birth if the mother\\nundergoes amniocentesis testing or chorionic villus\\nsampling (CVS). This testing is only recommended if\\nthe mother or father is known to have a chromosomerearrangement, or if they already have a child with PWSsyndrome.\\nTreatment\\nThere is currently not a cure for PWS. Treatment\\nduring infancy includes therapies to improve muscletone. Some infants with PWS also require special nipplesand feeding techniques to improve weight gain.\\nTreatment and management during childhood, ado-\\nlescence, and adulthood is typically focused on weightcontrol.

However, occasionally a child begins to developsexually much earlier. Between four to eight times morecommon in girls than boys, precocious puberty occurs inone out of every 5,000 to 10,000 U.S. children.\\nPrecocious puberty often begins before age 8 in\\ngirls, triggering the development of breasts and hairunder the arms and in the genital region. The onset ofovulation and menstruation also may occur. In boys, thecondition triggers the development of a large penis andtesticles, with spontaneous erections and the productionof sperm. Hair grows on the face, under arms and in thepubic area, and acne may become a problem.\\nWhile the early onset of puberty may seem fairly\\nbenign, in fact it can cause problems when hormonestrigger changes in the growth pattern, essentially haltinggrowth before the child has reached normal adult height.Girls may never grow above 5 ft (152 cm) and boys oftenstop growing by about 5 ft 2 in (157 cm).\\nThe abnormal growth patterns are not the only prob-\\nlem, however. Children with this condition look noticeablydifferent than their peers, and may feel rejected by theirfriends and socially isolated. Adults may expect these chil-dren to act more maturely simply because they look somuch older. As a result, many of these children—especiallyboys—are much more aggressive than others their own age,leading to behavior problems both at home and at school.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPuberty begins when the brain secretes a hormone\\nthat triggers the pituitary gland to release gonadotropins,which in turn stimulate the ovaries or testes to producesex hormones. These sex hormones (especially estrogenin girls and testosterone in boys) are what causes theonset of sexual maturity.\\nThe hormonal changes of precious puberty are nor-\\nmal—it’s just that the whole process begins a few yearstoo soon. Especially in girls, there is not usually anyunderlying problem that causes the process to begin toosoon. However, some boys do inherit the condition; theresponsible gene may be passed directly from father toson, or inherited indirectly from the maternal grandfatherthrough the mother, who does not begin early pubertyherself). This genetic condition in girls can be traced inonly about 1% of cases.\\nIn about 15% of cases, there is an underlying cause\\nfor the precious puberty, and it is important to search forthese causes. The condition may result from a benigntumor in the part of the brain that releases hormones.Less commonly, it may be caused by other types of braintumors, central nervous system disorders, or adrenalgland problems.\\nDiagnosis\\nPhysical exams can reveal the development of sexu-\\nal characteristics in a young child. Bone x rays can revealbone age, and pelvic ultrasound may show an enlarged\\nuterus and rule out ovarian or adrenal tumors. Blood testscan highlight higher-than-normal levels of hormones.MRI or CAT scans should be considered to rule outintracranial tumors.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment aims to halt or reverse sexual develop-\\nment so as to stop the accompanying rapid growth thatwill limit a child’s height. There are two possibleapproaches: either treat the underlying condition (such asan ovarian or intracranial tumor) or change the hormonalbalance to stop sexual development. It may not be possi-ble to treat the underlying condition; for this reason,treatment is usually aimed at adjusting hormone levels.\\nThere are several drugs that have been developed to\\ndo this:\\n• histrelin (Supprelin)\\n• nafarelin (Synarel)• synthetic gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist• deslorelin• ethylamide\\n• triptorelin\\n• leuprolide\\nPrognosis\\nDrug treatments can slow growth to 2–3 in (5–7.5\\ncm) a year, allowing these children to reach normal adultheight, although the long-term effects aren’t known.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCarlson, Karen J., Stephanie A.

Turkington\\nPrednis seeCorticosteroids\\nPreeclampsia and eclampsia\\nDefinition\\nPreeclampsia and eclampsia are complications of\\npregnancy . In preeclampsia, the woman has dangerously\\nhigh blood pressure, swelling, and protein in the urine. Ifallowed to progress, this syndrome will lead to eclampsia.\\nDescription\\nBlood pressure is a measurement of the pressure of\\nblood on the walls of blood vessels called arteries. Thearteries deliver blood from the heart to all of the tissuesin the body. Blood pressure is reported as two numbers.For example a normal blood pressure is reported as110/70 mm Hg (read as 110 over 70 millimeters of mer-cury; or just 110 over 70). These two numbers representtwo measurements, the systolic pressure and the diastolicpressure. The systolic pressure (the first number in theexample; 110/70 mm Hg) measures the peak pressure ofthe blood against the artery walls. This higher pressureoccurs as blood is being pumped out of the heart and intothe circulatory system. The pumping chambers of theheart (ventricles) squeeze to force the blood out of theheart. The diastolic pressure (the second number in theexample 110/70 mm Hg) measures the pressure duringthe filling of the ventricles. At this point, atria contract tofill the ventricles. Because the ventricles are relativelyrelaxed, and are not pumping blood into the arteries, thepressure in the arteries is lower as well.\\nHigh blood pressure in pregnancy ( hypertension ) is\\na very serious complication. It puts both the mother andthe fetus (developing baby) at risk for a number of prob-lems. Hypertension can exist in several different forms:\\n• The preeclampsia-eclampsia continuum (also called\\npregnancy-induced hypertension or PIH). In this typeof hypertension, high blood pressure is first notedsometime after week 20 of pregnancy and is accompa-nied by protein in the urine and swelling.\\n• Chronic hypertension. This type of hypertension usual-\\nly exists before pregnancy or may develop before week20 of pregnancy.\\n• Chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia.\\nThis syndrome occurs when a woman with pre-existingchronic hypertension begins to have protein in the urineafter week 20 of pregnancy.\\n• Late hypertension. This is a form of high blood pres-\\nsure occurring after week 20 of pregnancy and is unac-companied by protein in the urine and does notprogress the way preeclampsia-eclampsia does.\\nPreeclampsia is most common among women who\\nhave never given birth to a baby (called nulliparas).About 7% of all nulliparas develop preeclampsia. Thedisease is most common in mothers under the age of 20,or over the age of 35. African-American women havehigher rates of preeclampsia than do Caucasian women.Other risk factors include poverty, multiple pregnancies(twins, triplets, etc.), pre-existing chronic hypertensionor kidney disease, diabetes, excess amniotic fluid, and acondition of the fetus called nonimmune hydrops. Thetendency to develop preeclampsia appears to run in fami-lies. The daughters and sisters of women who have hadpreeclampsia are more likely to develop the condition.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nExperts are still trying to understand the exact caus-\\nes of preeclampsia and eclampsia. It is generally accept-ed that preeclampsia and eclampsia are problematicbecause these conditions cause blood vessels to leak. Theeffects are seen throughout the body.\\n• General body tissues. When blood vessels leak, they\\nallow fluid to flow out into the tissues of the body. Theresult is swelling in the hands, feet, legs, arms, andface. While many pregnant women experience swellingin their feet, and sometimes in their hands, swelling ofthe upper limbs and face is a sign of a more seriousproblem. As fluid is retained in these tissues, thewoman may experience significant weight gain (two ormore pounds per week).\\n• Brain. Leaky vessels can cause damage within the\\nbrain, resulting in seizures or coma .\\n• Eyes. The woman may experience problems seeing,\\nand may have blurry vision or may see spots. The retinamay become detached.\\n• Lungs. Fluid may leak into the tissues of the lungs,\\nresulting in shortness of breath .\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2692Preeclampsia and eclampsia'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 399}, page_content='• Liver. Leaky vessels within the liver may cause it to\\nswell. The liver may be involved in a serious complica-tion of preeclampsia, called the HELLP syndrome. Inthis syndrome, red blood cells are abnormallydestroyed, chemicals called liver enzymes are abnor-mally high, and cells involved in the clotting of blood(platelets) are low.\\n• Kidneys. The small capillaries within the kidneys can\\nleak. Normally, the filtration system within the kidneyis too fine to allow protein (which is relatively large) toleave the bloodstream and enter the urine. In pre-eclampsia, however, the leaky capillaries allow proteinto be dumped into the urine. The development of pro-tein in the urine is very serious, and often results in alow birth weight baby. These babies have a higher riskof complications, including death.\\n• Blood pressure. In preeclampsia, the volume of circulat-\\ning blood is lower than normal because fluid is leakinginto other parts of the body. The heart tries to make upfor this by pumping a larger quantity of blood with eachcontraction. Blood vessels usually expand in diameter(dilate) in this situation to decrease the work load on theheart. In preeclampsia, however, the blood vessels areabnormally constricted, causing the heart to work evenharder to pump against the small diameters of the ves-sels. This causes an increase in blood pressure.\\nThe most serious consequences of preeclampsia and\\neclampsia include brain damage in the mother due tobrain swelling and oxygen deprivation during seizures.Mothers can also experience blindness, kidney failure,liver rupture, and placental abruption . Babies born to\\npreeclamptic mothers are often smaller than normal,which makes them more susceptible to complicationsduring labor, delivery, and in early infancy. Babies ofpreeclamptic mothers are also at risk of being born pre-maturely, and can suffer the complications associatedwith prematurity .\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosing preeclampsia may be accomplished by\\nnoting painless swelling of the arms, legs, and/or face, inaddition to abnormal weight gain. The patient’s bloodpressure is taken during every doctor’s visit during preg-nancy. An increase of 30 mm Hg in the systolic pressure,or 15 mm Hg in the diastolic pressure, or a blood pressurereading greater than 140/90 mm Hg is considered indica-tive of preeclampsia. A simple laboratory test in the doc-tor’s office can indicate the presence of protein in a urinesample (a dipstick test). A more exact measurement of theamount of protein in the urine can be obtained by collect-ing urine for 24 hours, and then testing it in a laboratoryto determine the actual quantity of protein present. A 24-hour urine specimen containing more than 500 mg of pro-\\ntein is considered indicative of preeclampsia.\\nTreatment\\nWith mild preeclampsia, treatment may be limited to\\nbed rest, with careful daily monitoring of weight, bloodpressure, and urine protein via dipstick. This carefulmonitoring will be required throughout pregnancy, labor,delivery, and even for 2–4 days after the baby has beenborn. About 25% of all cases of eclampsia develop in thefirst few days after the baby’s birth. If the diastolic pres-sure does not rise over 100 mm Hg prior to delivery, andno other symptoms develop, the woman can continuepregnancy until the fetus is mature enough to be deliv-ered safely. Ultrasound tests can be performed to monitorthe health and development of the fetus.\\nIf the diastolic blood pressure continues to rise over\\n100 mm Hg, or if other symptoms like headache , vision\\nproblems, abdominal pain , or blood abnormalities\\ndevelop, then the patient may require medications toprevent seizures. Magnesium sulfate is commonly giventhrough a needle in a vein (intravenous, or IV). Medica-tions that lower blood pressure (antihypertensive drugs)are reserved for patients with very high diastolic pres-sures (over 110 mm Hg), because lowering the bloodpressure will decrease the amount of blood reaching thefetus. This places the fetus at risk for oxygen depriva-tion. If preeclampsia appears to be progressing towardtrue eclampsia, then medications may be given in orderto start labor. Babies can usually be delivered vaginally.After the baby is delivered, the woman’s blood pressureand other vital signs will usually begin to return to nor-mal quickly.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis in preeeclampsia and eclampsia\\ndepends on how carefully a patient is monitored. Verycareful, consistent monitoring allows quick decisions tobe made, and improves the woman’s prognosis. Still, themost common causes of death in pregnant women arerelated to high blood pressure.\\nAbout 33% of all patients with preeclampsia will\\nhave the condition again with later pregnancies.Eclampsia occurs in about 1 out of every 200 womenwith preeclampsia. If not treated, eclampsia is almostalways fatal.\\nPrevention\\nMore information on how preeclampsia and\\neclampsia develop is needed before recommendations\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2693Preeclampsia and eclampsia'),\n",

By the end ofthe first month, the liver and digestive system begin todevelop, and the heart starts to beat.\\nSecond month\\nIn this month, the heart starts to pump and the ner-\\nvous system (including the brain and spinal cord) beginsto develop. The 1 in (2.5 cm) long fetus has a completecartilage skeleton, which is replaced by bone cells bymonth’s end. Arms, legs and all of the major organsbegin to appear. Facial features begin to form.\\nThird month\\nBy now, the fetus has grown to 4 in (10 cm) and\\nweighs a little more than an ounce (28 g). Now the majorblood vessels and the roof of the mouth are almost com-pleted, as the face starts to take on a more recognizablyhuman appearance. Fingers and toes appear. All themajor organs are now beginning to form; the kidneys arenow functional and the four chambers of the heart arecomplete.\\nFourth month\\nThe fetus begins to kick and swallow, although most\\nwomen still can’t feel the baby move at this point. Now 4oz (112 g), the fetus can hear and urinate, and has estab-lished sleep-wake cycles. All organs are now fullyformed, although they will continue to grow for the nextfive months. The fetus has skin, eyebrows, and hair.\\nFifth month\\nNow weighing up to a 1 lb (454 g) and measuring\\n8–12 in (20–30 cm), the fetus experiences rapid growthas its internal organs continue to grow. At this point, themother may feel her baby move, and she can hear theheartbeat with a stethoscope.\\nSixth month\\nEven though its lungs are not fully developed, a\\nfetus born during this month can survive with intensivecare. Weighing 1–1.5 lb (454–681 g), the fetus is red,wrinkly, and covered with fine hair all over its body. Thefetus will grow very fast during this month as its organs\\ncontinue to develop.\\nSeventh month\\nThere is a better chance that a fetus born during this\\nmonth will survive. The fetus continues to grow rapidly,and may weigh as much as 3 lb (1.3 kg) by now. Now thefetus can suck its thumb and look around its waterywomb with open eyes.\\nEighth month\\nGrowth continues but slows down as the baby begins\\nto take up most of the room inside the uterus. Now weigh-ing 4–5 lbs (1.8–2.3 kg) and measuring 16–18 in (40–45cm) long, the fetus may at this time prepare for deliverynext month by moving into the head-down position.\\nNinth month\\nAdding 0.5 lb (227 g) a week as the due date\\napproaches, the fetus drops lower into the mother’sabdomen and prepares for the onset of labor, which maybegin any time between the 37th and 42nd week of gesta-tion. Most healthy babies will weigh 6–9 lbs (2.7–4 kg)at birth, and will be about 20 in long.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe first sign of pregnancy is usually a missed men-\\nstrual period, although some women bleed in the begin-ning. A woman’s breasts swell and may become tenderas the mammary glands prepare for eventual breastfeed-ing. Nipples begin to enlarge and the veins over the sur-face of the breasts become more noticeable.\\nNausea and vomiting are very common symptoms\\nand are usually worse in the morning and during thefirst trimester of pregnancy. They are usually caused byhormonal changes, in particular, increased levels ofprogesterone. Women may feel worse when their stom-ach is empty, so it is a good idea to eat several smallmeals throughout the day, and to keep things like crack-ers on hand to eat even before getting out of bed in themorning.\\nMany women also feel extremely tired during the\\nearly weeks. Frequent urination is common, and theremay be a creamy white discharge from the vagina. Somewomen crave certain foods, and an extreme sensitivity tosmell may worsen the nausea. Weight begins to increase.\\nIn the second trimester (13–28 weeks) a woman\\nbegins to look noticeably pregnant and the enlarged uterusis easy to feel. The nipples get bigger and darker, skin maydarken, and some women may feel flushed and warm.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2695Pregnancy'),\n",

During the second trimester, nau-sea and vomiting often fade away, and the pregnantwoman often feels much better and more energetic. Heartrate increases as does the volume of blood in the body.\\nBy the third trimester (29–40 weeks), many women\\nbegin to experience a range of common symptoms.Stretch marks may develop on abdomen, breasts andthighs, and a dark line may appear from the navel topubic hair. A thin fluid may be expressed from the nip-ples. Many women feel hot, sweat easily and often find ithard to get comfortable. Kicks from an active baby maycause sharp pains, and lower backaches are common.More rest is needed as the woman copes with the addedstress of extra weight. Braxton Hicks contractions may\\nget stronger.\\nAt about the 36th week in a first pregnancy (later in\\nrepeat pregnancies), the baby’s head drops down low intothe pelvis. This may relieve pressure on the upperabdomen and the lungs, allowing a woman to breathemore easily. However, the new position places morepressure on the bladder.A healthy gain for most women is between 25 and 35\\npounds. Women who are overweight should gain less; andwomen who are underweight should gain more. On aver-age, pregnant women need an additional 300 calories aday. Generally, women will gain three to five pounds inthe first three months, adding one to two pounds a weekuntil the baby is born. An average, healthy full-term babyat birth weighs 7.5 lb (3.4 kg), and the placenta and fluidtogether weigh another 3.5 lb. The remaining weight thata woman gains during pregnancy is mostly due to waterretention and fat stores. Her breasts, for instance, gainabout 2 lb. in weight, and she gains another 4 lb due to theincreased blood volume of pregnancy.\\nIn addition to the typical, common symptoms of preg-\\nnancy, some women experience other problems that maybe annoying, but which usually disappear after delivery.Constipation may develop as a result of food passing more\\nslowly through the intestine.

The newesthome tests can detect pregnancy on the day of the missedmenstrual period.\\nHome pregnancy tests are more than 97% accurate if\\nthe result is positive, and about 80% accurate if the resultis negative. If the result is negative and there is no men-strual period within another week, the pregnancy testshould be repeated. While home pregnancy tests are veryaccurate, they are less accurate than a pregnancy test con-ducted at a lab. For this reason, women may want to con-sider having a second pregnancy test conducted at theirdoctor’s office to be sure of the accuracy of the result.\\nBlood tests to determine pregnancy are usually used\\nonly when a very early diagnosis of pregnancy is needed.This more expensive test, which also looks for hCG, canproduce a result within nine to 12 days after conception.\\nOnce pregnancy has been confirmed, there are a\\nrange of screening tests that can be done to screen forbirth defects , which affect about 3% of unborn children.\\nTwo tests are recommended for all pregnant women:alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and the triple marker test.\\nOther tests are recommended for women at higher\\nrisk for having a child with a birth defect. This wouldinclude women over age 35, who had another child or aclose relative with a birth defect, or who have beenexposed to certain drugs or high levels of radiation.Women with any of these risk factors may want to con-sider amniocentesis ,chorionic villus sampling (CVS)\\nor ultrasound.\\nOther prenatal tests\\nThere are a range of other prenatal tests that are rou-\\ntinely performed, including:\\n•PAP test\\n• gestational diabetes screening test at 24–28 weeks• tests for sexually transmitted diseases\\n•urinalysis\\n• blood tests for anemia or blood type• screening for immunity to various diseases, such as\\nGerman measles\\nTreatment\\nPrenatal care is vitally important for the health of the\\nunborn baby. A pregnant woman should be sure to eat abalanced, nutritious diet of frequent, small meals.Women should begin taking 400 mcg of folic acid sever-\\nal months before becoming pregnant, as folic acid hasbeen shown to reduce the risk of spinal cord defects, suchas spina bifida .\\nNo medication (not even a nonprescription drug)\\nshould be taken except under medical supervision, sinceit could pass from the mother through the placenta to thedeveloping baby. Some drugs, called teratogens, havebeen proven harmful to a fetus, but no drug should beconsidered completely safe (especially during early preg-nancy). Drugs taken during the first three months of apregnancy may interfere with the normal formation ofthe baby’s organs, leading to birth defects. Drugs takenlater on in pregnancy may slow the baby’s growth rate, orthey may damage specific fetal tissue (such as the devel-oping teeth), or cause preterm birth.\\nTo have the best chance of having a healthy baby, a\\npregnant woman should avoid:\\n• smoking\\n• alcohol\\n• street drugs\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2697Pregnancy'),\n",

The highestnumber of complaints is among teenage, young adult,and sexually inexperienced males. Increased risk is asso-ciated with sexual inexperience and lack of knowledge ofnormal male sexual responses.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are several reasons why a man may ejaculate\\nprematurely. For some men, the cause is due to an innatereflex or psychological predisposition of the nervous sys-tem. Sometimes it can be caused by certain drugs, suchas non-prescription cold medications. Psychological fac-tors, such as stress , fear, or guilt can also play a role.\\nExamples of psychological factors include guilt that thesexual activity is wrong or sinful, fear of getting caught,or stress from problems at work or home.\\nIn general, symptoms are when a male reaches cli-\\nmax in less than two minutes or when it occurs before themale or couple want it to occur.\\nDiagnosis\\nThere are no tests used to diagnose premature ejacu-\\nlation. It is usually determined by the male involvedbased on his belief that he reached orgasm too quickly.General guidelines for premature ejaculation is if itoccurs in two minutes or less, or prior to about 15 thrustsduring sexual intercourse.\\nTreatment\\nIn 1966, William H. Masters and Virginia E. John-\\nson published Human Sexual Response, in which they\\nbroke the first ground in approaching this topic from anew perspective. Their method was devised by Dr. JamesSeman and has been modified subsequently by Dr. HelenSinger Kaplan and others.\\nA competent and orthodox sex therapist will spend\\nmuch more time focusing on the personal than the sexualrelationship between the two people who come for treat-ment. Without emotional intimacy, sexual relations aresuperficial and sexual problems such as premature ejacu-lation are not always overcome.\\nWith that foremost in mind, a careful plan is out-\\nlined that requires dedication, patience, and commitmentby both partners. It necessarily begins by prohibitingintercourse for an extended period of time—at least aweek, often a month. This is very important to the manbecause “performance anxiety” is the greatest enemy ofperformance. If he knows he cannot have intercourse heis able to relax and focus on the exercises. The first stageis called “sensate focus” and involves his concentrationon the process of sexual arousal and climax. He shouldlearn to recognize each step in the process, most particu-larly the moment just before the “point of no return.” Ide-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2699Premature ejaculation'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 406}, page_content='ally, this stage of treatment requires the man’s partner to\\nbe devoted to his sensations. In order to regain equality,he should in turn spend separate time stimulating andpleasing his mate, without intercourse.\\nAt this point the techniques diverge. The original\\n“squeeze technique” requires that the partner becomeexpert at squeezing the head of the penis at intervals toprevent orgasm. The modified procedure, described byDr. Ruth Westheimer, calls upon the man to instruct thepartner when to stop stimulating him to give him achance to draw back. A series of stages follows, eachoffering greater stimulation as the couple gains greatercontrol over his arousal. This whole process has beencalled “outercourse.” After a period of weeks, they willhave together retrained his response and gained satisfac-tory control over it. In addition, they will each havelearned much about the other’s unique sexuality andways to increase each other’s pleasure.\\nWith either technique, the emphasis is on the mutual\\ngoal of satisfactory sexual relations for both partners.\\nHowever, the 1990s ushered in a new era in the treat-\\nment of premature ejaculation when physicians discov-ered that certain antidepression drugs had a side effect ofdelaying ejaculation. Clinical studies have shown that aclass of antidepressants called selective seratonin reup-take inhibitors (SSRIs) can be very effective in prolong-ing the time to ejaculation. The individual drugs and theaverage amount of time they delay ejaculation are fluox-etine (Prozac), one to two minutes with doses of 20-40milligrams per day (mg/day) and eight minutes with 60mg/day; paroxetine (Paxil), three to 10 minutes withdoses of 20–40 mg/day; and sertraline (Zoloft), two tofive minutes with doses of 50–200 mg/day.\\nAlternative treatment\\nThere are several alternative products, usually found\\nin health food and nutrition stores, designed to besprayed or rubbed on the penis to delay ejaculation.Although the products promise results, there are no validclinical studies to support the claims. A device called atesticular restraint, sold through erotic mail-order maga-zines, sometimes helps men delay ejaculation. The Vel-cro-like device restrains the testicles from their naturaltendency to move during sex. Testicular movement cancause premature ejaculation.\\nPrognosis\\nThe “squeeze technique” has elicited a 95% success\\nrate, whereby the patient is able to control ejaculation.Treatment with SSRIs is effective in 85–90% of cases.However, the effectiveness begins to decrease after fiveweeks of daily administration. Although more studies areneeded, this suggests the SSRIs are more effective when\\nused on an as-needed basis.\\nPrevention\\nThe best prevention is obtaining adequate informa-\\ntion on normal sexual responses of males before havingsex. It is also helpful to have sex in a comfortable,relaxed, private setting, free of guilt, stress, and fear.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nMasters, William H., Virginia E. Johnson, and Robert C.\\nKolodny.

Premature labor is defined ascontractions that occur after 20 weeks and before 37weeks during the term of pregnancy. The baby is morelikely to survive and be healthy if it remains in the uterusfor the full term of the pregnancy. It is estimated thataround 10% of births in the United States occur during\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2700Premature labor'),\n",

Premature birth is the greatest\\ncause of newborn illness and death . In the United States,\\nprematurity has a greater impact on African-Americans.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe causes of premature labor cannot always be deter-\\nmined. Some research suggests that infection of the urinaryor reproductive tract may stimulate premature labor andpremature births. Multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.)are more likely to result in to premature labor. Smoking ,\\nalcohol use, drug abuse, and poor nutrition can increase\\nthe risk of premature labor and birth. Adolescent mothersare also at higher risk for premature delivery. Womenwhose mothers took diethylstilbestrol (DES) when theycarried them are more likely to deliver prematurely, as arewomen who have had previous surgery on the cervix.\\nThe symptoms of premature labor can include con-\\ntractions of the uterus or tightening of the abdomen,which occurs every ten minutes or more frequently.These contractions usually increase in frequency, dura-tion, and intensity, and may or may not be painful. Othersymptoms associated with premature labor can includemenstrual-like cramps, abdominal cramping with orwithout diarrhea , pressure or pain in the pelvic region,\\nlow backache, or a change in the color or amount of vagi-nal discharge. As labor progresses, the cervix or openingof the uterus will open (dilate) and the tissue around itwill become thinner (efface). Premature rupture of\\nmembranes (when the water breaks) may also occur.\\nAn occasional contraction can occur anytime during\\nthe pregnancy and does not necessarily indicate thatlabor is starting. Premature contractions are sometimesconfused with Braxton Hicks contractions, which canoccur throughout the pregnancy. Braxton Hicks contrac-tions do not cause the cervix to open or efface, and areconsidered “false labor.”\\nDiagnosis\\nThe health care provider will conduct a physical\\nexamination and ask about the timing and intensity of\\nthe contractions. A vaginal examination is the only wayto determine if the cervix has started to dilate or efface.Urine and blood samples may be collected to screen forinfection. A vaginal culture (a cotton-tipped swab is usedto collect some fluid and cells from the vagina) may bedone to look for a vaginal infection. A fetal heart monitormay be placed on the mother’s abdomen to record theheartbeat of the fetus and to time the contractions. A fetalultrasound may be performed to determine the age andweight of the fetus, the condition of the placenta, and tosee if there is more than one fetus present. Amniocente-\\nsiswill sometimes be performed. This is a procedurewhere a needle-like tube is inserted through the mother’s\\nabdomen to draw out some of the fluid surrounding thefetus. Analysis of the amniotic fluid can determine if thebaby’s lungs are mature. A baby with mature lungs ismuch more likely to survive outside the uterus.\\nTreatment\\nThe goal of treatment is to stop the premature labor\\nand prevent the fetus from being delivered before it is fullterm. A first recommendation may be for the woman withpremature contractions to lie down with feet elevated andto drink juice or other fluids. If contractions continue orincrease, medical attention should be sought. In additionto bed rest, medical care may include intravenous fluids.Sometimes, this extra fluid is enough to stop contractions.In some cases, oral or injectable drugs like terbutaline sul-fate, ritodrine, magnesium sulfate, or nifedipine must begiven to stop the contractions. These are generally veryeffective; however, as with any drug therapy, there arerisks of side effects. Some women may need to continueon medication for the duration of the pregnancy. Antibi-\\notics may be prescribed if a vaginal or urinary tract infec-\\ntion is detected. If the membranes have already ruptured,it may be difficult or impossible to stop premature labor.If infection of the membranes that cover the fetus(chorioamnionitis) develops, the baby must be delivered.\\nPrognosis\\nIf premature labor is managed successfully, the\\npregnancy may continue normally for the delivery of ahealthy infant. Once symptoms of preterm labor occurduring the pregnancy, the mother and fetus need to bemonitored regularly since it is likely that premature laborwill occur again. If the preterm labor cannot be stoppedor controlled, the infant will be delivered prematurely.These infants that are born prematurely have anincreased risk of health problems including birth\\ndefects , lung problems, mental retardation , blindness,\\ndeafness, and developmental disabilities. If the infant isborn too early, its body systems may not be matureenough for it to survive. Evaluating the infant’s lungmaturity is one of the keys to determining its chance ofsurvival. Fetuses delivered further into pregnancy andthose with more mature lungs are more likely to survive.\\nPrevention\\nSmoking, poor nutrition, and drug or alcohol abuse\\ncan increase the risk of premature labor and early delivery.Smoking and drug or alcohol use should be stopped. Ahealthy diet and prenatal vitamin supplements (prescribedby the health care provider) are important for the growth ofthe fetus and the health of the mother.

Possible causes include autoimmune prob-lems and common cancer treatments.\\nDescription\\nAbout half of all women will go through menopause\\nbefore age 51 and the rest will go through it after. Mostwomen will finish menopause between the ages of 42and 58. A small number of women will find that theirperiods stop prematurely, before age 40.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are many possible causes of premature\\nmenopause. Women who have premature menopauseoften have autoimmune disorders like thyroid disease\\nor diabetes mellitus . In these diseases, the body pro-\\nduces antibodies to one or more of its own organs. Theseantibodies interfere with the normal function of theorgan. Just as antibodies might attack the thyroid or thepancreas (causing thyroid disease or diabetes), antibod-ies may attack the ovaries and stop the production offemale hormones.\\nCancer treatments like chemotherapy or radiation\\ncan cause premature menopause.

A\\nwoman may find that she cannot become pregnantbecause she is not ovulating (producing eggs) anymore.\\nWhen menopause occurs after the ovaries are surgi-\\ncally removed, the symptoms begin within several daysafter surgery and tend to be more severe. This happensbecause the drop in the level of estrogen is dramatic,unlike the gradual drop that usually occurs.\\nDiagnosis\\nPremature menopause can be confirmed by blood\\ntests to measure the levels of follicle stimulating hormone(FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).

Women who have premature\\nmenopause should take HRT. Estrogen relieves the unpleas-ant symptoms of menopause, including the hot flashes andthe vaginal dryness. Estrogen is especially important forwomen who go through premature menopause. The long-term health risks of menopause (osteoporosis and increasedrisk of heart disease) are even more likely to occur after pre-mature menopause. However, women who have certainmedical conditions (like liver disease, uterine cancer, orbreast cancer ) may not be candidates for estrogen.\\nIf a woman still has her uterus after premature\\nmenopause, she will also need to take progesterone alongwith the estrogen. If her uterus has been removed, estro-gen alone will be enough.\\nWomen who wish to become pregnant after prema-\\nture menopause now have the option of fertility treat-ments using donor eggs.

Tuteur, MD\\nPremature rupture of\\nmembranes\\nDefinition\\nPremature rupture of membranes (PROM) is an\\nevent that occurs during pregnancy when the sac con-\\ntaining the developing baby (fetus) and the amnioticfluid bursts or develops a hole prior to the start of labor.\\nDescription\\nDuring pregnancy, the unborn baby (fetus) is sur-\\nrounded and cushioned by a liquid called amniotic fluid.This fluid, along with the fetus and the placenta, isenclosed within a sac called the amniotic membrane. Theamniotic fluid is important for several reasons. It cush-ions and protects the fetus, allowing the fetus to movefreely. The amniotic fluid also allows the umbilical cordto float, preventing it from being compressed and cuttingoff the fetus’s supply of oxygen and nutrients. The amni-otic membrane contains the amniotic fluid and protectsthe fetal environment from the outside world. This barri-er protects the fetus from organisms (like bacteria orviruses) that could travel up the vagina and potentiallycause infection.\\nAlthough the fetus is almost always mature at 36–40\\nweeks and can be born without complication, a normalpregnancy lasts an average of 40 weeks. At the end of 40weeks, the pregnancy is referred to as being “term.” Atterm, labor usually begins. During labor, the muscles ofthe uterus contract repeatedly. This allows the cervix tobegin to grow thinner (called effacement) and more open(dilatation). Eventually, the cervix will become com-pletely effaced and dilated. In the most common\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2703Premature rupture of membranes'),\n",

Ultimately, the baby will be delivered out of themother’s vagina. In the 30 minutes after the birth of thebaby, the placenta should separate from the wall of theuterus and be delivered out of the vagina.\\nSometimes the membranes burst before the start of\\nlabor, and this is called premature rupture of membranes(PROM). There are two types of PROM. One occurs at apoint in pregnancy before normal labor and deliveryshould take place. This is called preterm PROM. The othertype of PROM occurs at 36–40 weeks of pregnancy.\\nPROM occurs in about 10% of all pregnancies. Only\\nabout 20% of these cases are preterm PROM. PretermPROM is responsible for about 34% of all prematurebirths.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe causes of PROM have not been clearly identi-\\nfied. Some risk factors include smoking , multiple preg-\\nnancies (twins, triplets, etc.), and excess amniotic fluid(polyhydramnios). Certain procedures carry an increasedrisk of PROM, including amniocentesis (a diagnostic\\ntest involving extraction and examination of amnioticfluid) and cervical cerclage (a procedure in which theuterus is sewn shut to avoid premature labor ). A condi-\\ntion called placental abruption is also associated with\\nPROM, although it is not known which condition occursfirst. In some cases of preterm PROM, it is believed thatbacterial infection of the amniotic membrane causes it toweaken and then break. However, most cases of PROMand infection occur in the opposite order, with PROMoccurring first followed by an infection.\\nThe main symptom of PROM is fluid leaking from\\nthe vagina. It may be a sudden, large gush of fluid, or itmay be a slow, constant trickle of fluid. The complica-tions that may follow PROM include premature laborand delivery of the fetus, infections of the mother and/orthe fetus, and compression of the umbilical cord (leadingto oxygen deprivation in the fetus).\\nLabor almost always follows PROM, although the\\ndelay between PROM and the onset of labor varies. WhenPROM occurs at term, labor almost always begins within24 hours. Earlier in pregnancy, labor can be delayed up toa week or more after PROM. The chance of infectionincreases as the time between PROM and labor increases.While this may cause doctors to encourage labor in thepatient who has reached term, the risk of complications ina premature infant may cause doctors to try delayinglabor and delivery in the case of preterm PROM.The types of infections that can complicate PROM\\ninclude amnionitis and endometritis. Amnionitis is aninfection of the amniotic membrane. Endometritis is aninfection of the innermost lining of the uterus. Amnioni-tis occurs in 0.5–1% of all pregnancies. In the case ofPROM at term, amnionitis complicates about 3–15% ofpregnancies. About 15–23% of all cases of pretermPROM will be complicated by amnionitis. The presenceof amnionitis puts the fetus at great risk of developing anoverwhelming infection ( sepsis ) circulating throughout\\nits bloodstream. Preterm babies are the most susceptibleto this life-threatening infection. One type of bacteriaresponsible for overwhelming infections in newbornbabies is called group B streptococci.\\nDiagnosis\\nDepending on the amount of amniotic fluid leaking\\nfrom the vagina, diagnosing PROM may be easy. Somedoctors note that amniotic fluid has a very characteristicmusty smell. A pelvic exam using a sterile medical\\ninstrument (speculum) may reveal a trickle of amnioticfluid leaving the cervix, or a pool of amniotic fluid col-lected behind the cervix. One of two easy tests can beperformed to confirm that the liquid is amniotic fluid. Adrop of the fluid can be placed on nitrazine paper.Nitrazine paper is made so that it turns from yellowishgreen to dark blue when it comes in contact with amniot-ic fluid. Another test involves smearing a little of thefluid on a slide, allowing it to dry, and then viewing itunder a microscope. When viewed under the microscope,dried amniotic fluid will be easy to identify because itwill look “feathery” like a fern.\\nOnce PROM has been diagnosed, efforts are made to\\naccurately determine the age of the fetus and the maturityof its lungs. Premature babies are at great risk if theyhave immature lungs. These evaluations can be madeusing amniocentesis and ultrasound measurements of thefetus’ size. Amniocentesis also allows the practitioner tocheck for infection. Other indications of infectioninclude a fever in the mother, increased heart rate of the\\nmother and/or the fetus, high white blood cell count inthe mother, foul smelling or pus-filled discharge from thevagina, and a tender uterus.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of PROM depends on the stage of the\\npatient’s pregnancy. In PROM occurring at term, themother and baby will be watched closely for the first24 hours to see if labor will begin naturally. If no laborbegins after 24 hours, most doctors will use medica-tions to start labor. This is called inducing labor.Labor is induced to avoid a prolonged gap between\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2704Premature rupture of membranes'),\n",

The younger the fetus, the more likely it maydie or suffer serious permanent damage if delivered pre-maturely. Yet the risk of infection to the mother and/orthe fetus increases as the length of time from PROM todelivery increases. Depending on the age of the fetusand signs of infection, the doctor must decide either totry to prevent labor and delivery until the fetus is moremature, or to induce labor and prepare to treat the com-plications of prematurity . However, the baby will need\\nto be delivered to avoid serious risks to both it and themother if infection is present, regardless of the risks ofprematurity.\\nA variety of medications may be used in PROM:\\n• Medication to induce labor (oxytocin) may be used,\\neither in the case of PROM occurring at term or in thecase of preterm PROM and infection.\\n• Tocolytics may be given to halt or prevent the start of\\nlabor. These may be used in the case of preterm PROM,when there are no signs of infection. Delaying the startof labor may give the fetus time to develop moremature lungs.\\n• Steroids may be used to help the fetus’ lungs mature\\nearly. Steroids may be given in preterm PROM if thefetus must be delivered early because of infection orlabor that cannot be stopped.\\n•Antibiotics can be given to fight infections. Research is\\nbeing done to determine whether antibiotics should begiven prior to any symptoms of infection to avoid thedevelopment of infection.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis in PROM varies.

Infants born before 37 weeks gestation are consideredpremature and may be at risk for complications.\\nDescription\\nMore than one out of every ten infants born in the\\nUnited States is born prematurely. Advances in medicaltechnology have made it possible for infants born as youngas 23 weeks gestational age (17 weeks premature) to sur-vive. These premature infants, however, are at higher riskfor death or serious complications, which include heart\\ndefects, respiratory problems, blindness, and brain damage.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe birth of a premature baby can be brought on by\\nseveral different factors, including premature labor ; pla-\\ncental abruption , in which the placenta detaches from\\nthe uterus; placenta previa , in which the placenta grows\\ntoo low in the uterus; premature rupture of\\nmembranes , in which the amniotic sac is torn, causing\\nthe amniotic fluid to leak out; incompetent cervix ,i n\\nwhich the opening to the uterus opens too soon; andmaternal toxemia, or blood poisoning . While one of these\\nconditions are often the immediate reason for a prematurebirth, its underlying cause is usually unknown. Prematuri-ty is much more common in multiple pregnancy and for\\nmothers who have a history of miscarriages or who havegiven birth to a premature infant in the past. One of thefew, and most important, identifiable causes of prematuri-ty is drug abuse, particularly cocaine , by the mother.\\nInfants born prematurely may experience major\\ncomplications due to their low birth weight and theimmaturity of their body systems. Some of the commonproblems among premature infants are jaundice (yellow\\ndiscoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes), apnea (along pause in breathing), and inability to breast or bottlefeed. Body temperature, blood pressure, and heart ratemay be difficult to regulate in premature infants. Thelungs, digestive system, and nervous system (includingthe brain) are underdeveloped in premature babies, andare particularly vulnerable to complications. Some of themore common risks and complications of prematurity aredescribed below.\\nRespiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is the most\\ncommon problem seen in premature infants. Babies borntoo soon have immature lungs that have not developedsurfactant, a protective film that helps air sacs in the lungsto stay open. With RDS, breathing is rapid and the centerof the chest and rib cage pull inward with each breath.Extra oxygen can be supplied to the infant through tubesthat fit into the nostrils of the nose, or by placing the babyunder an oxygen hood. In more serious cases, the babymay have to have a breathing tube inserted and receive airfrom a respirator or ventilator. A surfactant drug can begiven in some cases to coat the lung tissue. Extra oxygenmay be need for a few days or weeks, depending on howsmall and premature the baby was at birth. Bronchopul-monary dysplasia is the development of scar tissue in thelungs, and can occur in severe cases of RDS.\\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a further com-\\nplication of prematurity. In this condition, part of thebaby’s intestines are destroyed as a result of bacterialinfection. In cases where only the innermost lining of thebowel dies, the infant’s body can regenerate it over time;however, if the full thickness of a portion dies, it must beremoved surgically and an opening (ostemy) must bemade for the passage of wastes until the infant is healthyenough for the remaining ends to be sewn together.Because NEC is potentially fatal, doctors are quick torespond to its symptoms, which include lethargy, vomit-ing, a swollen and/or red abdomen, fever , and blood in\\nthe stool. Measures include taking the infant off mouthfeedings and feeding him or her intravenously; adminis-tering antibiotics ; and removing air and fluids from the\\ndigestive tract via a nasal tube. Approximately 70% ofNEC cases can be successfully treated without surgery.\\nIntraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is another seri-\\nous complication of prematurity. It is a condition inwhich immature and fragile blood vessels within thebrain burst and bleed into the hollow chambers (ventri-cles) normally reserved for cerebrospinal fluid and intothe tissue surrounding them. Physicians grade the severi-ty of IVH according to a scale of I–IV , with I beingbleeding confined to a small area around the burst vesselsand IV being an extensive collection of blood not only inthe ventricles, but in the brain tissue itself. Grades I andII are not uncommon, and the baby’s body usually reab-sorbs the blood with no ill effects. However, more severeIVH can result in hydrocephalus , a potentially fatal con-\\ndition in which too much fluid collects in the ventricles,exerting increased pressure on the brain and causing thebaby’s head to expand abnormally. To drain fluid andrelieve pressure on the brain, doctors will either performlumbar punctures, a procedure in which a needle isinserted into the spinal canal to drain fluids; install areservoir, a tube that drains fluid from a ventricle andinto an artificial chamber under or on top of the scalp; orinstall a ventricular shunt , a tube that drains fluid from\\nthe ventricles and into the abdomen, where it is reab-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2706Prematurity'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 413}, page_content='sorbed by the body. Infants who are at high risk for IVH\\nusually have an ultrasound taken of their brain in the firstweek after birth, followed by others if bleeding is detect-ed. IVH cannot be prevented; however, close monitoringcan ensure that procedures to reduce fluid in the brain areimplemented quickly to minimize possible damage.\\nApnea of prematurity is a condition in which the\\ninfant stops breathing for periods lasting up to 20 sec-onds. It is often associated with a slowing of the heartrate. The baby may become pale, or the skin color maychange to a blue or purplish hue. Apnea occurs mostcommonly when the infant is asleep. Infants with seriousapnea may need medications to stimulate breathing oroxygen through a tube inserted in the nose. Some infantsmay be placed on a ventilator or respirator with a breath-ing tube inserted into the airway. As the baby gets older,and the lungs and brain tissues mature, the breathing usu-ally becomes more regular.\\nAs the fetus develops, it receives the oxygen it needs\\nfrom the mother’s blood system. Most of the blood in theinfant’s system bypasses the lungs. Once the baby isborn, its own blood must start pumping through the lungsto get oxygen. Normally, this bypass duct closes withinthe first few hours or days after birth. If it does not close,the baby may have trouble getting enough oxygen on itsown. Patent ductus arteriosus is a condition in which\\nthe duct that channels blood between two main arteriesdoes not close after the baby is born. In some cases, adrug, indomethacin, can be given to close the duct.Surgery may be required if the duct does not close on itsown as the baby develops.\\nRetinopathy of prematurity is a condition in which\\nthe blood vessels in the baby’s eyes do not develop nor-mally, and can, in some cases, result in blindness. Prema-ture infants are also more susceptible to infections. Theyare born with fewer antibodies, which are necessary tofight off infections.\\nDiagnosis\\nMany of the problems associated with prematurity\\ndepend on how early the baby is born and how much itweighs at birth. The most accurate way of determiningthe gestational age of an infant in utero is calculatingfrom a known date of conception or using ultrasoundimaging to observe development. When a baby is born,doctors can use the Dubowitz exam to estimate gesta-tional age. This standardized test scores responses to 33specific neurological stimuli to estimate the infant’sneural development. Once the baby’s gestational age andweight are determined, further tests and electronic fetal\\nmonitoring may need to be used to diagnose problems\\nor to track the baby’s condition. A blood pressure moni-tor may be wrapped around the arm or leg. Several types\\nof monitors can be taped to the skin. A heart monitor orcardiorespiratory monitor may be attached to the baby’schest, abdomen, arms, or legs with adhesive patches tomonitor breathing and heart rate. A thermometer probemay be taped on the skin to monitor body temperature.Blood samples may be taken from a vein or artery. X raysor ultrasound imaging may be used to examine the heart,lungs, and other internal organs.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment depends on the types of complications that\\nare present. It is not unusual for a premature infant to beplaced in a heat-controlled unit (an incubator) to maintainits body temperature. Infants that are having troublebreathing on their own may need oxygen either pumpedinto the incubator, administered through small tubesplaced in their nostrils, or through a respirator or ventila-tor, which pumps air into a breathing tube inserted intothe airway. The infant may require fluids and nutrients tobe administered through an intravenous line, in which asmall needle is inserted into a vein in the hand, foot, arm,leg, or scalp. If the baby needs drugs or medications, theymay also be administered through the intravenous line.Another type of line may be inserted into the baby’sumbilical cord. This can be used to draw blood samples orto administer medications or nutrients. If heart rate isirregular, the baby may have heart monitor leads taped tothe chest. Many premature infants require time and sup-port with breathing and feeding until they mature enoughto breathe and eat unassisted. Depending on the compli-cations, the baby may require drugs or surgery.\\nPrognosis\\nAdvances in medical care have made it possible for\\nmany premature infants to survive and develop normally.However, whether or not a premature infant will surviveis still intimately tied to his or her gestational age:\\n• 21 weeks or less: 0% survival rate\\n• 22 weeks: 0–10% survival rate• 23 weeks: 10–35% survival rate\\n• 24 weeks: 40–70% survival rate\\n• 25 weeks: 50–80% survival rate• 26 weeks: 80–90% survival rate• 27 weeks: greater than 90% survival rate\\nPhysicians cannot predict long-term complications\\nof prematurity and some consequences may not becomeevident until the child is school-aged.

The risks ofserious long term complications depend on many fac-tors including how premature the infant was at birth,weight at birth, and the presence or absence of breath-ing problems. The development of infection or the pres-ence of a birth defect can also affect long term progno-sis. Severe disabilities like brain damage, blindness,and chronic lung problems are possible and may requireongoing care.\\nPrevention\\nSome of the risks and complications of premature\\ndelivery can be reduced if the mother receives good pre-natal care, follows a healthy diet, avoids alcohol con-sumption, and refrains from cigarette smoking . In some\\ncases of premature labor, the mother may be placed onbed rest or given drugs that can stop labor contractions fordays or weeks, giving the developing infant more time todevelop before delivery. The physician may prescribe asteroid medication to be given to the mother before thedelivery to help speed up the baby’s lung development.The availability of neonatal intensive care unit, a specialhospital unit equipped and trained to deal with prematureinfants, can also increase the chances of survival.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nO’Shea, T.

Twin studies have demonstrated a positive corre-lation with heritability and PMDD symptoms. Anti-anxi-ety medications have been shown to help improve symp-toms associated with PMDD. The most common symp-toms include headache , swelling of ankles, feet, and\\nhands, backache, abdominal cramps, heaviness or pain ,\\nbloating and/or gas, muscle spasms, breast tenderness,weight gain, recurrent cold sores, acne , nausea, consti-\\npation or diarrhea , food cravings, anxiety or panic,\\nconfusion, difficulty concentrating and forgetfulness,poor judgment, and depression.\\nDiagnosis\\nPMDD is diagnosed when symptoms occur during\\nthe second half of the menstrual cycle (14 days or moreafter the first day of a woman’s period), are absent forabout seven days after the period ends, increase in severi-ty as the cycle progresses, go away when the menstrualflow begins or shortly thereafter, and occur for at leastthree consecutive menstrual cycles. There are no tests todiagnose it. The diagnosis of PMDD emphasizes andrequires psychologically important mood symptoms.\\nTreatment\\nRecently, the Food and Drug Administration\\napproved the first prescription drug for the treatment ofPMDD, Serafem (fluoxetine). Additionally, nons-\\nteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , such as ibuprofen\\nand aspirin , may help with bloating and pain; beta-\\nblockers may help with migraines; anti-anxiety medica-tions, such as buspirone or alpraxolam, may help withanxiety; and certain other antidepressants in addition toSerafem may help with depression.\\nAlternative treatment\\nNon-pharmaceutical treatments include a variety of\\nlifestyle changes, such as following a healthy diet, exer-KEY TERMS\\nAntidepressant —A medication used to relieve the\\nsymptoms of clinical depression.\\nBeta blockers —Class of drug, including Corgard\\n(nadolol), and Lanoxin (digoxin), that primarilywork by blunting the action of adrenaline, thebody’s natural fight-or-flight chemical.\\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs —This class\\nof drugs includes aspirin and ibuprofen, and pri-marily works by interfering with the formation ofprostaglandins, enzymes implicated in pain andinflammation.\\ncise,stress relief therapies, and even such alternative\\ntherapies as aromatherapy .

The symptoms include both physical symptoms,such as breast tenderness, back pain , abdominal cramps,\\nheadache , and changes in appetite, as well as psycholog-\\nical symptoms of anxiety , depression, and unrest. Severe\\nforms of this syndrome are referred to as premenstrual\\ndysphoric disorder (PMDD). These symptoms may be\\nrelated to hormones and emotional disorders.\\nDescription\\nApproximately 75% of all menstruating women\\nexperience some symptoms that occur before or duringmenstruation. PMS encompasses symptoms severeenough to interfere with daily life. About 3–5% of womenexperience the more severe PMDD. These symptoms canlast 4–10 days and can have a substantial impact on awoman’s life.\\nThe reason some women get severe PMS while oth-\\ners have none is not understood. PMS symptoms usuallybegin at about age 20-30 years. The disease may run infamilies and is also more prone to occur in women with ahistory of psychological problems. Overall however, it isdifficult to predict who is most at risk for PMS.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBecause PMS is restricted to the second half of a\\nwoman’s menstrual cycle, after ovulation, it is thoughtthat hormones play a role. During a woman’s monthlymenstrual cycle, which lasts 24–35 days, hormone levelschange. The hormone estrogen gradually rises during thefirst half of a woman’s cycle, the preovulatory phase, andfalls dramatically at ovulation. After ovulation, the pos-tovulatory phase, progesterone levels gradually increaseuntil menstruation occurs. Both estrogen and proges-terone are secreted by the ovaries, which are responsiblefor producing the eggs. The main role of these hormonesis to cause thickening of the lining of the uterus(endometrium). However, estrogen and progesterone alsoaffect other parts of the body, including the brain. In thebrain and nervous system, estrogen can affect the levelsof neurotransmitters, such as serotonin. Serotonin haslong been known to have an effect on emotions, as wellas eating behavior. It is thought that when estrogen levelsgo down during the postovulatory phase of the menstrualcycle, decreases in serotonin levels follow. Whether thesechanges in estrogen, progesterone, and serotonin areresponsible for the emotional aspects of PMS is notknown with certainty. However, most researchers agreethat the chemical transmission of signals in the brain andnervous system is in some way related to PMS. This issupported by the fact that the times following childbirth\\nand menopause are also associated with both depression\\nand low estrogen levels.\\nSymptoms for PMS are varied and many, including\\nboth physical and emotional aspects that range from mildto severe. The physical symptoms include: bloating,headaches, food cravings, abdominal cramps, headaches,tension, and breast tenderness. Emotional aspects includemood swings, irritability, and depression.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe best way to diagnose PMS is to review a\\ndetailed diary of a woman’s symptoms for severalmonths. PMS is diagnosed by the presence of physical,psychological, and behavioral symptoms that are cyclicand occur in association with the premenstrual period oftime. PMDD, which is far less common, was officiallyrecognized as a disease in 1987. Its diagnosis depends onthe presence of at least five symptoms related to moodthat disappear within a few days of menstruation. Thesesymptoms must interfere with normal functions andactivities of the individual. The diagnosis of PMDD hascaused controversy in fear that it may be used againstwomen, labeling them as being impaired by their men-strual cycles.\\nTreatment\\nThere are many treatments for PMS and PMDD\\ndepending on the symptoms and their severity. For mildcases, treatment includes vitamins ,diuretics , and pain\\nrelievers. Vitamins E and B\\n6may decrease breast tender-\\nness and help with fatigue and mood swings in some\\nwomen. Diuretics that remove excess fluid from the bodyseem to work for some women. For more severe casesand for PMDD, treatments available include antidepres-\\nsant drugs , hormone treatment, or (only in extreme\\ncases) surgery to remove the ovaries. Hormone treatmentusually involves oral contraceptives . This treatment, as\\nwell as removal of the ovaries, is used to prevent ovula-tion and the changes in hormones that accompany ovula-tion. Recent studies, however, indicate that hormonetreatment has little effect over placebo.\\nAntidepressants\\nThe most progress in the treatment of PMS and\\nPMDD has been through the use of antidepressant drugs.The most effective of these include sertraline (Zoloft),fluoxetine (Prozac), and paroxetine (Paxil). They are\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2710Premenstrual syndrome'),\n",

Some doctors prescribeantidepressant treatment for PMS throughout the cycle,while others direct patients to take the drug only duringthe latter half of the cycle. Antidepressants should beavoided by women wanting to become pregnant. Arecent clinical study found that women who took sertra-line had a significant improvement in productivity, socialactivities, and relationships compared with a placebogroup. Side effects of sertraline were found to includenausea, diarrhea , and decreased libido.\\nAlternative treatment\\nThere are alternative treatments that can both affect\\nserotonin and hormone responses, as well as affect someof the physical symptoms of PMS.\\nVitamins and minerals\\nSome women find relief with the use of vitamin and\\nmineral supplements. Magnesium can reduce the fluidretention that causes bloating, while calcium maydecrease both irritability and bloating. Magnesium andcalcium also help relax smooth muscles and this mayreduce cramping. Vitamin E may reduce breast tender-ness, nervous tension, fatigue, and insomnia . Vitamin B\\n6\\nmay decrease fluid retention, fatigue, irritability, and\\nmood swings. Vitamin B5supports the adrenal glands and\\nmay help reduce fatigue.\\nPhytoestrogens and natural progesterone\\nThe Mexican wild yam ( Dioscorea villosa ) contains\\na substance that may be converted to progesterone in thebody. Because this substance is readily absorbed throughthe skin, it can be found as an ingredient in many skincreams. (Some products also have natural progesteroneadded to them.) Some herbalists believe that these prod-ucts can have a progesterone-like effect on the body anddecrease some of the symptoms of PMS.\\nThe most important way to alter hormone levels may\\nbe by eating more phytoestrogens. These plant-derivedcompounds have an effect similar to estrogen in thebody. One of the richest sources of phytoestrogens is soyproducts, such as tofu. Additionally, many supplementscan be found that contain black cohosh ( Cimicifugarace-\\nmosa ) or dong quai ( Angelica sinensis ), which are herbs\\nhigh in phytoestrogens. Red clover ( Trifolium pratense ),\\nalfalfa ( Medicago sativa ), licorice ( Glycyrrhiza glabra ),\\nhops ( Humulus lupulus ), and legumes are also high in\\nphytoestrogens. Increasing the consumption of phytoe-strogens is also associated with decreased risks of osteo-\\nporosis ,cancer , and heart disease.KEY TERMS\\nAntidepressant —A drug used to control depression.\\nEstrogen —A female hormone important in the\\nmenstrual cycle.\\nNeurotransmitter —A chemical messenger used to\\ntransmit an impulse from one nerve to the next.\\nPhytoestrogens —Compounds found in plants that\\ncan mimic the effects of estrogen in the body.\\nProgesterone —A female hormone important in\\nthe menstrual cycle.\\nSerotonin —A neurotransmitter important in regu-\\nlating mood.\\nAntidepressant alternatives\\nMany antidepressants act by increasing serotonin\\nlevels. An alternative means of achieving this is to eatmore carbohydrates. For instance, two cups of cereal or acup of pasta have enough carbohydrates to effectivelyincrease serotonin levels. An herb known as St. John’s\\nwort (Hypericum perforatum ) has stood up to scientific\\ntrials as an effective antidepressant. As with the standardantidepressants, however, it must be taken continuouslyand does not show an effect until used for 4–6 weeks.There are also herbs, such as skullcap ( Scutellaria lateri-\\nflora ) and kava ( Piper methysticum ), that can relieve the\\nanxiety and irritability that often accompany depression.An advantage of these herbs is that they can be takenwhen symptoms occur rather than continually. Chastetree ( Vitex agnus-castus ), in addition to helping rebal-\\nance estrogen and progesterone in the body, also mayrelieve the anxiety and depression associated with PMS.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for women with both PMS and\\nPMDD is good. Most women who are treated for thesedisorders do well.\\nPrevention\\nMaintaining a good diet, one low in sugars and fats\\nand high in phytoestrogens and complex carbohydrates,may prevent some of the symptoms of PMS. Womenshould try to exercise three times a week, keep in gener-\\nally good health, and maintain a positive self image.Because PMS is often associated with stress , avoidance\\nof stress or developing better means to deal with stresscan be important.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2711Premenstrual syndrome'),\n",

Basi-\\ncally, it is a checklist for people to see if they are livinglives that are most accommodating to having a healthypregnancy. Prepregnancy counseling gives time for oneto make changes before pregnancy.\\nPurpose\\nThe purpose and goal of prepregnancy counseling is\\nto help patients have full-term, healthy pregnancies andbabies. The counseling and education are importantbecause lifestyle habits such as smoking or alcohol\\nusage can be hazardous to a developing fetus.\\nPrecautions\\nWomen who have diabetes should take special pre-\\ncautions before pregnancy. This counseling, usually pro-vided by a team of professionals including a registereddietitian, diabetes educators, an obstetrician, and others,helps to prevent early pregnancy loss and congenital mal-formations in infants of diabetic mothers.\\nWomen who have a history of genetic disease can\\nopt to have genetic testing . Prepregnancy counseling can\\ninclude referrals to those specialists.Women who are over 40 have higher cesarean sec-\\ntion rates. They are also more likely than youngerwomen to have conditions such as high blood pressure,and are more likely to have babies with genetic problem,such as Down syndrome.\\nWomen who are considering pregnancy should\\navoid exposure to hazards such as chemicals, illicitdrugs, alcohol, and smoking. They should reduce theircaffeine intake and be careful not to let their body tem-\\nperatures rise to dangerous levels.\\nDescription\\nPrepregnancy counseling involves communicating\\nimportant aspects about nutrition , medication use, and\\nlifestyle months in advance of getting pregnant. Issuesinclude diet, nutrition, exercise , smoking, alcohol, drugs,\\nemotional health, and referral to genetic counseling if a\\npatient knows of a history of inherited disease.\\nPreparation\\nThe mother-to-be should stop using birth control pills\\nto allow for at least two regular menstrual cycles to occurbefore conception. This requires that she stop taking birthcontrol pills several months before getting pregnant.\\nOther steps to prepare for pregnancy include:\\nBeing at optimal weight. Women should not go on\\nprepregnancy weight loss diets unless they are under the\\ncare of a physician because abrupt weight loss can affectthe mother’s menstrual cycle and reduce fertility.\\nEating a balanced diet. This is achieved by taking a\\nprenatal vitamin provided by a health care provider andfocusing on nutrients that are important for a developingfetus. These include folate, or folic acid , which is impor-\\ntant for the development of the baby’s brain and spinalcord. Folate can be found in fortified cereals, citrusfruits, and green leafy vegetables. Calcium is importantfor baby and mother. It helps the baby’s bones to developnormally and keeps the mother from suffering a calciumdeficiency during pregnancy. Iron keeps the mother fromdeveloping anemia during pregnancy. Good sources ofiron are green leafy vegetables, red meat, beans, and for-tified cereal. Fiber helps mothers avoid constipation ,a\\ncommon occurrence during pregnancy. Good sources offiber include beans, fruits, and vegetables.\\nExercising on a regular basis.

Presbyopia occurs without regard to other eyeconditions.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn the eye, the crystalline lens is located just behind\\nthe iris and the pupil. Tiny ciliary muscles pull and pushthe lens, adjusting its curvature, and thereby adjustingthe eye’s focal power to bring objects into focus. As indi-viduals age, the lens becomes less flexible and elastic,and the muscles become less powerful. Because thesechanges result in inadequate adjustment of the lens of theeye for various distances, objects that are close willappear blurry. The major cause of presbyopia is loss ofelasticity of the lens of the eye. Loss of ciliary musclepower, however, is also believed to contribute to theproblem.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2713Presbyopia'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 420}, page_content='Symptoms of presbyopia result in the inability to\\nfocus on objects close at hand. As the lens hardens, it isunable to focus the rays of light that come from nearbyobjects. Individuals typically have difficulty readingsmall print, such as that in telephone directories andnewspaper advertisements, and may need to hold readingmaterials at arm’s length. Symptoms include headache\\nand eyestrain when doing close work, blurry vision, andeye fatigue . Symptoms may be worse early in the morn-\\ning or when individuals are fatigued. Dim lighting mayalso aggravate the problem.\\nDiagnosis\\nPresbyopia is officially diagnosed during an eye\\nexamination conducted by eye specialists, such as\\noptometrists or ophthalmologists. After completing opto-metric college, doctors of optometry screen patients foreye problems and prescribe glasses and contact lenses. Incontrast, ophthalmologists are medical doctors who spe-cialize in eye diseases. They perform eye surgery, treat eyediseases, and also prescribe glasses and contact lenses.\\nA comprehensive eye examination requires at least\\n30 minutes. Part of the examination will assess visionwhile reading by using various strength lenses. If thepupils are dilated with drugs to permit a thorough exami-nation of the retina, an additional hour is required. Thecost of eye examinations can range from $40–$250depending on the complexity and site of the examinationand the qualifications and reputation of the examiner.Some insurers cover the cost of routine eye examinations,while others do not. A thorough eye examination is rec-ommended at regular intervals during the adult and agingyears to monitor and diagnose eye conditions. However,individuals frequently self-diagnose presbyopia by tryingon inexpensive mass-produced reading glasses until theyfind a pair that permits reading without strain.\\nTreatment\\nPresbyopia cannot be cured, but individuals can\\ncompensate for it by wearing reading, bifocal, or trifocaleyeglasses. A convex lens is used to make up for the lostautomatic focusing power of the eye. Half-glasses can beworn, which leave the top open and uncorrected for dis-tance vision. Bifocals achieve the same goal by allowingcorrection of other refractive errors (improper focusingof images on the retina of the eye).\\nIn addition to glasses, contact lenses have also been\\nfound to be useful in the treatment of presbyopia. The twocommon types of contact lenses prescribed for this condi-tion are bifocal and monovision contact lenses. Bifocalcontact lenses are similar to bifocal glasses. The top por-tion of the lens serves as the distance lens while the lower\\nserves as the near vision lens. To prevent rotation while inthe eye, bifocal contacts use a specially manufacturedtype of lens. Good candidates for bifocal lenses are thosepatients who have a good tear film (moist eyes), goodbinocular vision (ability to focus both eyes together) andvisual acuity in each eye, and no disease or abnormalitiesin the eyelids. The bifocal contact lens wearer must bemotivated to invest the time it requires to maintain contactlenses and be involved in occupations that do not imposehigh visual demands. Further, bifocal contact lenses maylimit binocular vision. Bifocal contact lenses are relative-ly expensive, in part due to the time it takes the patient tobe accurately fitted.\\nAn alternative to wearing eyeglasses or bifocal con-\\ntact lenses is monovision contact lenses. Monovision fit-ting provides one contact lens that corrects for nearvision and a second contact lens for the alternate eye thatcorrects for distance vision. If distance vision is normal,the individual wears only a single contact lens for nearvision. Monovision works by having one eye focus fordistant objects while the other eye becomes the readingeye. The brain learns to adapt to this and will automati-cally use the correct eye depending on the location ofmaterial in view. Advantages of monovision are patientacceptability, convenience, and lower cost.\\nSeveral problems exist with the use of contact lenses\\nin the treatment of presbyopia. Some individuals experi-ence headache and fatigue during the adjustment periodor find the slight decrease in visual acuity unacceptable.Monovision contact lenses usually result in a smallreduction in high-contrast visual acuity when comparedwith bifocal contact lenses.\\nPrognosis\\nThe changes in vision due to aging usually start in a\\nperson’s early 40s and continue for several decades. Atsome point, there is no further development of presby-opia, as the ability to accommodate is virtually gone.\\nPrevention\\nThere is no known way to prevent presbyopia.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nErnest, J.

However,\\nunlike a normal erection that dissipates after sexual activ-ity ends, the persistent erection caused by priapism ismaintained because the blood in the penile shaft does notdrain. The shaft remains hard, while the tip of the penis issoft. If it is not relieved promptly, priapism can lead topermanent scarring of the penis and inability to have anormal erection.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPriapism is caused by leukemia, sickle cell disease ,\\nor spinal cord injury . It has also been associated as a rare\\nside effect to trazodone (Desyrel), a drug prescribed totreat depression. An overdose of self-injected chemicals tocounteract impotence has also been responsible for pri-\\napism. The chemicals are directly injected into the penis,and at least a quarter of all men who have used this methodof treatment for over three months develop priapism.\\nDiagnosis\\nA physical examination is needed to diagnose pri-\\napism. Further testing, including nuclear scanning orDoppler ultrasound, will diagnose the underlying causeof the condition.\\nTreatment\\nThere are three methods of treatment. The most effec-\\ntive is the injection of medicines into the penis that allowthe blood to escape. Cold packs may also be applied toalleviate the condition, but this method becomes ineffec-tive after about eight hours. For the most serious cases andthose that do not respond to the first two treatments, a nee-dle can be used to remove the blood. The tissues may needto be flushed with saline or diluted medications by thesame needle method. That failing, there are more exten-sive surgical procedures available. One of them shuts offmuch of the blood supply to the penis so that it can relax.If the problem is due to a sickle cell crisis, treatment of thecrisis with oxygen or transfusion may suffice.\\nPrognosis\\nIf priapism is relieved within the first 12–24 hours,\\nthere is usually no residual damage. After that, perma-nent impotence may result, since the high pressure in thepenis compromises blood flow and leads to tissue death(infarction).\\nPrevention\\nAn antineoplastic drug (hydroxyurea) may prevent\\nfuture episodes of priapism for patients with sickle celldisease.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2715Priapism'),\n",

Sweat glands are coil-shaped and extend deep into the skin. They are capableof plugging up at several different depths, producing fourdistinct skin rashes .\\n• Miliaria crystallina is the most superficial of the occlu-\\nsions. At this level, only the thin upper layer of skin isaffected. Little blisters of sweat that cannot escape tothe surface form. A bad sunburn as it just starts to blis-\\nter can look exactly like this.\\n• Deeper plugging causes miliaria rubra as the sweat\\nseeps into the living layers of skin, where it irritates anditches.\\n• Miliaria pustulosais (a complication of miliaria rubra)\\noccurs when the sweat is infected with pyogenic bacte-ria and turns to pus.\\n• Deeper still is miliaria profunda. The skin is dry, and\\ngoose bumps may or may not appear.\\nThere are two requirements for each of these phases\\nof sweat retention: hot enough weather to induce sweat-ing, and failure of the sweat to reach the surface.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBest evidence as of 2001 suggests that bacteria form\\nthe plugs in the sweat glands. These bacteria are proba-bly normal inhabitants of the skin, and why they sudden-ly interfere with sweat flow is still not known.\\nInfants are more likely to get miliaria rubra than\\nadults. All the sweat retention rashes are also more likelyto occur in hot, humid weather.\\nBesides itching , these conditions prevent sweat\\nfrom cooling the body, which it is supposed to do byevaporating from the skin surface. Sweating is the mostimportant cooling mechanism available in hot environ-ments. If it does not work effectively, the body can rapid-ly become too hot, with severe and even lethal conse-quences. Before entering this phase of heat stroke , there\\nwill be a period of heat exhaustion symptoms—dizzi-ness, thirst, weakness—when the body is still effectivelymaintaining its temperature. Then the temperature rises,often rapidly, to 104–5°F (40°C) and beyond. This is anemergency of the first order, necessitating immediate andrapid cooling. The best method is immersion in ice water.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe rash and dry skin in hot weather are usually suf-\\nficient to diagnose these conditions.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2716Prickly heat'),\n",

Autoimmunity describes theprocess whereby the body’s defense mechanisms areturned against itself. The immune system is supposed torecognize and attack only dangerous foreign invaderslike germs, but many times it attacks, for no apparentreason, the cells of the body itself. Autoimmune reac-tions occur in many different tissues of the body, creatinga great variety of diseases.\\nPrimary biliary cirrhosis progressively destroys the\\nsystem that drains bile from the liver into the intestines.Bile is a collection of waste products excreted by theliver. As the disease progresses it also scars the liver,leading to cirrhosis. In some patients, the diseasedestroys the liver in as little as five years. In others, itmay lie dormant for a decade or more.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nNinety percent of patients with this disease are\\nwomen between the ages of 35 and 60. The first sign of itmay be an abnormal blood test on routine examination.Itching is a common early symptom, caused by a buildup\\nof bile in the skin. Fatigue is also common in the early\\nstages of the disease. Later symptoms include jaundice\\nfrom the accumulation of bile and specific nutritionaldeficiencies—bruising from vitamin K deficiency , bone\\npain from vitamin D deficiency , night blindness from\\nvitamin A deficiency , and skin rashes , possibly from vit-\\namin E or essential fatty acid deficiency. All these vitaminproblems are related to the absence of bile to assist in theabsorption of nutrients from the intestines.\\nDiagnosis\\nBlood tests strongly suggest the correct diagnosis,\\nbut a liver biopsy is needed for confirmation. It is also\\nusually necessary to x ray the biliary system to look forother causes of obstruction.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2717Primary biliary cirrhosis'),\n",

It can\\nalso be caused by inflammatory bowel diseases, such asCrohn’s disease , or ulcerative colitis (a chronic recur-\\nrent ulceration in the colon)—with which it is a verycommon component. Occasionally it is caused by anamoeba that causes dysentery.\\nDischarge of blood and mucus and intense pain in\\nthe area of the rectum and anus are all signs of proctitis.Patients feel the urge to have frequent bowel movementseven when there is nothing present to eliminate. Theymay also have constipation ,diarrhea ,fever , and open\\nsores around the anus. Other symptoms include cramping,lower back pain, difficulty urinating, and impotence .\\nDiagnosis\\nProctitis is diagnosed by a patient history and physi-\\ncal examination . It is confirmed by a proctoscopy\\n(examination of the rectum with an endoscope insertedthrough the anus). Proctoscopy usually shows a red, sore,inflamed lining of the rectum. Biopsies, smears, and labcultures of rectal material are used to determine the exactcause of the inflammation so that the underlying causecan be treated appropriately.\\nSince the two problems often occur together, in the\\npresence of proctitis, the large bowel should be examinedfor ulcerative colitis.\\nTreatment\\nOnce the underlying cause of the inflammation is\\ndiagnosed, appropriate treatment begins. Antibiotics are\\ngiven for bacterial infections. There is no cure for genitalherpes, but the antiviral drug, acyclovir, is often pre-scribed to reduce symptoms. Corticosteroid supposito-ries or ointments such as hydrocortisone are used tolessen discomfort, and the patient is encouraged to takewarm baths to ease painful symptoms. Ulcerative procti-tis often responds well to corticosteroid enemas or foam,\\nor to sulfasalazine and related drugs.\\nAlternative treatment\\nDepending on the cause of proctitis, alternative med-\\nicine has several types of treatments available. If proctitisis related to gonorrhea, syphilis, or chlamydia, appropri-ate antibiotic treatment is recommended. Supplementa-tion with Lactobacillus acidophilus is also recommended\\nduring and following antibiotic therapy to help rebuildnormal gut flora that is destroyed by antibiotics.

Sitz baths and\\ncompresses of herbal infusions (herbs steeped in hotwater) and decoctions (herbal extracts prepared by boil-ing the herb in water) can be very effective. Among theherbs recommended are calendula ( Calendula officinalis ),\\ncomfrey ( Symphytum officinale ), and plantain ( Plantago\\nmajor ). Proctitis related to candidiasis requires dietary\\nalterations, especially elimination of sugar from the diet.Any immunocompromised person needs close medicalattention. If proctitis is related to inflammatory bowel dis-eases, the resolution of the underlying condition shouldcontribute to resolution of the proctitis. Acupuncture and\\nhomeopathic treatment can be very useful in resolvinginflammatory bowel diseases.\\nPrognosis\\nProctitis caused by bacteria is curable with antibiotics.\\nGenital herpes is not curable. Although symptoms can besuppressed, proctitis may reoccur. Patients with AIDS areespecially susceptible to candidiasis infections, which maybe hard to control. Recovering from proctitis caused byinflammatory bowel diseases is variable and depends onsuccessful management of those diseases. Severe proctitiscan result in permanent narrowing of the anus.\\nPrevention\\nProctitis is best prevented by using condoms and\\npracticing safer sex to prevent acquiring sexually trans-mitted diseases. Avoiding anal intercourse also helps pre-vent damage to the rectum.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nMargolis, Simon, ed. “Proctitis.” In Johns Hopkins Symptoms\\nand Remedies.

It occurs in people with inade-\\nquate immune response and carries a poor prognosis.The incidence of PML, once quite rare, is rising as thenumbers of people living with persistently compromisedimmune systems rises. An estimated 2–7% of peoplewith HIV disease will develop PML. The infection alsooccurs among people undergoing long-term chemother-\\napyfor cancer . PML is not considered a contagious dis-\\nease. According to the Centers for Disease Control defin-ition of AIDS, PML in the presence of HIV infection issufficient to form a diagnosis of AIDS.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAlthough at least 80% of the adults in the United\\nStates have been exposed to JC virus (as evidenced bythe presence of antibodies to this virus), very few willdevelop PML. Little is certain about what causes JCV toproduce active disease, but the virus persists in the kid-neys of otherwise healthy people without making themill. Recent evidence suggests that after prolonged com-promise of the immune system, the virus changes into aform that can reach brain tissue and cause disease. InPML, the JCV infects and kills the cells (oligodendro-cytes) that produce myelin, which is needed to form thesheath that surrounds and protects nerves.\\nAbout 45% of people with PML experience vision\\nproblems, most often a blindness affecting half of thevisual field of each eye.

Other symptoms include lack ofcoordination, paralysis on one side of the body (hemi-\\nparesis), and problems in speaking or using language.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is difficult, but usually relies on a neurolo-\\ngist and radiologist assessing the white matter of the brainon a computed tomography scan or a magnetic resonance\\nimaging (MRI). Tests of the cerebrospinal fluid can help\\ndistinguish between PML and other diseases, such as mul-\\ntiple sclerosis and acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalopa-\\nthy.

The loss of nerve cells causes palsy, orparalysis , that slowly gets worse as the disease progress-\\nes. The palsy affects ability to move the eyes, relax themuscles, and control balance.\\nDescription\\nProgressive supranuclear palsy is a disease of mid-\\ndle age. Symptoms usually begin in the 60s, rarelybefore age 45 or after age 75. Men develop PSP moreoften than women do. It affects three to four people permillion each year.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPSP affects the brainstem, the basal ganglia, and the\\ncerebellum. The brainstem is located at the top of thespinal cord. It controls the most basic functions neededfor survival—the involuntary (unwilled) movements suchas breathing, blood pressure, and heart rate. The brain-stem has three parts: the medulla oblongata, the pons, andthe midbrain. The parts affected by PSP are the pons,which controls facial nerves and the muscles that turn theeye outward, and the midbrain, the visual center. Thebasal ganglia are islands of nerve cells located deep with-in the brain. They are involved in the initiation of volun-tary (willed) movement and control of emotion. Damageto the basal ganglia causes muscle stiffness (spasticity)and tremors . The cerebellum is located at the base of the\\nskull. It controls balance and muscle coordination.\\nVision is controlled by groups of cells called nuclei in\\nthe brainstem. In PSP, the nuclei continue to function, butthe mechanisms that control the nuclei are destroyed. Theterm supranuclear means that the damage is done above\\n(supra ) the nuclei. Patients with PSP have difficulty with\\nvoluntary (willed) eye movement. At first, the difficultyonly occurs in trying to look down. As the disease pro-gresses, ability to move the eyes right and left is alsoaffected. However, reflex or unwilled eye movementsremain normal. Thus, when the patient’s head is tiltedupwards, the eyes move to look down. These reflex move-ments remain normal until late in the course of the disease.The upper eyelids may be pulled back, the eyebrowsraised, and the brow wrinkled, causing a typical wide-eyedstare. Rate of blinking may decrease from the normal20–30 per minute to three to five per minute. It becomesdifficult to walk downstairs, to maintain eye contact dur-ing conversation, or to move the eyes up and down to read.\\nThe earliest symptoms of PSP may be frequent falls\\nor stiff, slow movements of the arms and legs. Thesesymptoms may appear as much as five years before thecharacteristic vision problems. Walking becomes increas-ingly awkward, and some patients tend to lean and fallbackward. Facial muscles may be weak, causing slurredspeech and difficulty swallowing. Sleep may be disturbedand thought processes slowed. Although memory remainsintact, the slowed speech and thought patterns and therigid facial expression may be mistaken for senile demen-\\ntiaor Alzheimer’s disease . Emotional responses may\\nbecome exaggerated and inappropriate, and the patientmay experience anxiety , depression, and agitation.\\nThe cause of PSP is not known. Most people who\\ndevelop PSP come from families with no history of thedisease, so it does not seem to be inherited, except in cer-tain rare instances. People who have PSP seem to lackthe neurotransmitters dopamine and homovanillic acid inthe basal ganglia. Neurotransmitters are chemicals thathelp carry electrical impulses along the nervous system.Transmitting structures in brain cells called neurofibrilsbecome disorganized (neurofibrillary tangles). Neurofib-rillary tangles are also found in Alzheimer’s disease, butthe pattern is somewhat different.\\nDiagnosis\\nPSP is sometimes mistaken for Parkinson’s disease ,\\nwhich is also associated with stiffness, frequent falls,slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and decreasedspontaneous movement. The facial expression in Parkin-son’s, however, is blank or mask-like, whereas in PSP it isa grimace and wide-eyed stare. PSP does not cause theuncontrolled shaking (tremor) in muscles at rest that isassociated with Parkinson’s disease. Posture is stooped inParkinson’s disease, but erect in PSP. Speech is of lowvolume in both diseases, but is more slurred and irregularin rhythm in PSP.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2721Progressive supranuclear palsy'),\n",

As the disease progresses,the difficulty in swallowing may cause the patient tochoke and get small amounts of food in the lungs. Thiscondition can cause aspiration pneumonia . The patient\\nmay also lose too much weight. In these cases, a feedingtube may be needed. The home environment should bemodified to decrease potential injury from falls. Walkerscan be weighted in front, to prevent backward falls andhandrails can be installed in the bathroom. Because thepatient cannot look down, low objects like throw rugs andcoffee tables should be removed. Dry eyes from infre-quent blinking can be treated with drops or ointments.\\nPrognosis\\nThe patient’s condition gradually deteriorates. After\\nabout seven years, balance problems and stiffness makeit nearly impossible for the patient to walk. Persons withPSP become more and more immobile and unable to carefor themselves. Death is not caused by the PSP itself. It\\nis usually caused by pneumonia related to choking on\\nsecretions or by starvation related to swallowing diffi-\\nculty.

Its role in the male has not been demonstrated,\\nbut in females, prolactin promotes lactation , or milk pro-\\nduction, after childbirth .\\nPurpose\\nThe prolactin test is used to diagnose pituitary dys-\\nfunction that might be caused by a tumor called an ade-noma. In some circumstances, the test is also used toevaluate absence of menstrual periods ( amenorrhea ), or\\nspontaneous production of milk ( galactorrhea ) by a\\nwoman who is not pregnant or lactating.\\nPrecautions\\nStress from trauma, illness, surgery, or even ner-\\nvousness about a blood test can elevate prolactin levels.Drugs that may increase prolactin include phenoth-iazines, oral contraceptives , opiates, histamine antago-\\nnists, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors),\\nestrogen, and antihistamines . Drugs that can decrease\\nvalues include levodopa and dopamine.\\nDescription\\nProlactin is also known as the lactogenic hormone or\\nlactogen. It is essential for the development of the mam-mary glands for lactation during pregnancy , and for\\nstimulating and maintaining lactation after childbirth.Like the human growth hormone, prolactin acts directlyon tissues, and its levels rise in response to sleep and tophysical or emotional stress. During sleep, prolactin lev-els can increase to the circulating levels found in pregnantwomen (as high as ten to twenty times the normal level).\\nProlactin secretion is controlled by prolactin-releas-\\ning and prolactin-inhibiting chemicals (factors) secretedby an area of the brain called the hypothalamus. Anotherhormone, thyroid-releasing hormone, or TRH, can alsostimulate prolactin.\\nTumors of the pituitary, called adenomas, are the\\nmost common cause of excessive levels of prolactin.Depending on the type of cell involved, these tumors arealso called prolactin-secreting pituitary acidophilic orchromophobic adenomas. Moderately high prolactin lev-els are found to a lesser extent in women with secondaryamenorrhea, galactorrhea, low thyroid, anorexia, and adisorder known as polycystic ovary syndrome , a dis-\\nease whose cause is not well-known.\\nBecause high prolactin levels are more likely due to\\npituitary adenoma than other causes, the prolactin level isused to diagnose and monitor this type of tumor. Severalstimulation and suppression tests, with TRH or levodopa,respectively, have been designed to differentiate pituitaryadenoma from other causes of prolactin overproduction.KEY TERMS\\nAdenoma —A benign tumor\\nAmenorrhea —The absence or abnormal stoppage\\nof menstrual periods.\\nFactor —Any of several substances necessary to\\nproduce a result or activity in the body.

In the United States, an estimated 1 in300,000 individuals per year die suddenly due to irregu-lar heart rhythms. One of the better understood causes ofthese arrhythmias is LQTS.\\nThe QT of LQTS refers to an interval between\\ntwo points (Q and T) on the common electrocardio-gram (ECG, EKG) used to record the electrical activi-ty of the heart. This electrical activity, in turn, is theresult of small molecules (ions such as sodium andpotassium) passing in and out of channels in the mem-branes surrounding heart cells. A prolonged QT inter-val indicates an abnormality in electrical activity thatleads to irregularities in heart muscle contraction. Oneof these irregularities is a specific pattern of very rapidcontractions (tachycardia) of the lower chambers ofthe heart called torsade de pointes, a type of ventricu-\\nlar tachycardia . The rapid contractions, which arenot effective in pumping blood to the body, result in a\\ndecreased flow of oxygen-rich blood to the brain. Thiscan result in a sudden loss of consciousness (syncope)and death.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBoth inherited and acquired forms of LQTS have\\nbeen identified. Most acquired forms are thought to bedue to certain drugs including adrenaline (epinephrine),several antihistamines and antibiotics , specific heart\\nmedications, diuretics , and others. It has been pro-\\nposed, but not yet documented, that individuals whoexperience LQTS after using one of these medications,may actually have a genetic defect that increases theirtendency to cardiac arrhythmias. Severe weight losssuch as is associated with anorexia nervosa can also\\ndisrupt ion balances in the heart and result in prolonga-tion of the QT interval.\\nThree inherited forms of LQTS have been described\\nto date. Jervell and Lange-Neilsen syndrome, named forthe physicians who described the condition in 1957, isassociated with congenital deafness and is inherited as anautosomal recessive trait. Romano-Ward syndrome, themost common inherited form of LQTS, was firstdescribed in the 1960’s. It is inherited in an autosomaldominant pattern and is not associated with other physi-cal impairments such as deafness. In 1995, a third type ofLQTS was reported in to occur in association with bilat-eral syndactyly. Little is known about the inheritance ofthis form, except that reported cases have been sporadicwith no associated family history of LQTS.\\nAs of early 2001, six different genes have been asso-\\nciated with the inherited forms of LQTS, and mutationsin at least four of these genes had been reported in anumber of affected individuals and families. The genesinvolved in LQTS play important roles in the formationof ion channels in the cell membrane, and, thus, muta-tions in these genes disrupt normal cardiac rhythms.\\nLQTS usually presents with symptoms that consti-\\ntute a life-threatening emergency. Sudden loss of con-sciousness or cardiac arrest can be brought on by emo-tional or physical stress in young, otherwise healthy\\nindividuals, both female and male. Fright, anger, sur-prise, sudden awakening as a result of loud sounds(alarm clock, telephone), as well as physical activities,especially swimming, have all been reported to precipi-tate an episode of cardiac arrhythmia in susceptible indi-viduals. Sudden death often occurs. Although the infor-mation is preliminary, recent research has also suggestedthat a small number of SIDS ( sudden infant death syn-\\ndrome ) cases may be due to mutations in one or more of\\nthe genes associated with LQTS.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2724Prolonged QT syndrome'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 431}, page_content='Diagnosis\\nProblems exist in diagnosing LQTS. Although the\\nmethod of diagnosis is the electrocardiogram, most young,healthy people do not routinely undergo this test, and,thus, their first, and possibly fatal, episode of LQTS comeswithout warning. In some cases, a non-fatal episode ismistakenly treated as a seizure, and, therefore, a follow-upassessment does not include an electrocardiogram. Inaddition, some cases of LQTS cannot be diagnosed by aroutine electrocardiogram. That is, the QT interval is notfound to be prolonged in routine testing. If LQTS is sus-pected either because of a previous episode of syncope orbecause of a family member with LQTS, an exercise elec-\\ntrocardiogram should be performed. In all instances wherean individual is diagnosed with LQTS, family membersshould be thoroughly evaluated, and a detailed family his-tory should be taken noting any individuals with episodesof sudden loss of consciousness and any cases of unex-plained sudden death. Because many of the genes involvedin LQTS have been identified, genetic testing can offer a\\nmore reliable means of diagnosis of other family membersat risk. The first step in determining if this type of testingis appropriate in any particular situation is to consult agenetic counselor or medical geneticist.\\nTreatment\\nA conventional treatment is the oral administration\\nof beta-blockers, medications that decrease the inputfrom the sympathetic nervous system to the heart.KEY TERMS\\nAnorexia nervosa —A loss of appetite for food not\\nexplainable by local disease. It is thought to have apsychological basis.\\nAutosomal dominant —A pattern of inheritance in\\nwhich only one of the two copies of an autosomalgene must be abnormal for a genetic condition ordisease to occur. An autosomal gene is a gene thatis located on one of the autosomes or non-sex chro-mosomes. A person with an autosomal dominantdisorder has a 50% chance of passing it to each oftheir offspring.\\nAutosomal recessive —A pattern of inheritance in\\nwhich both copies of an autosomal gene must beabnormal for a genetic condition or disease tooccur. An autosomal gene is a gene that is locatedon one of the autosomes or non-sex chromosomes.When both parents have one abnormal copy of thesame gene, they have a 25% chance with each\\npregnancy that their offspring will have the disorder.\\nDiuretic —An agent that increases the production of\\nurine.\\nElectrocardiogram —A record of the electrical activ-\\nity of the heart showing certain waves called P, Q,R, S, and T waves. The Q, R, S, T waves are associat-ed with contraction of the ventricles, the lower twochambers of the heart.\\nSympathetic nervous system —A division of the\\nautonomic nervous sytem, the portion of the ner-vous system that controls involuntary bodily func-tions such as heart rate.\\nSyndactyly —A fusion of two or more toes or fin-\\ngers.\\nAlthough beta-blockers do not correct the abnormali-\\nties in the ion channels of the heart cells, they doappear to decrease the occurrence of cardiac arrhyth-mias. However, these medications are not helpful in allcases, and are actually contraindicated in some individ-uals. Potassium supplementation is also being exploredas a treatment in certain cases. As the genetics ofLQTS becomes better understood, it should be possibleto tailor treatments that will be effective for each of thevarious gene mutations.\\nAlternative treatment\\nIn some patients, severing of the sympathetic nerve\\nto the heart has decreased the occurrence of arrhythmias.Pacemakers and defibrillators appear to hold promise as\\nnew forms of treatment. As devices of this type are devel-oped that are smaller in size, they may come into morewidespread use, either alone or in conjunction with spe-cific medications.\\nPrognosis\\nLQTS is a life-long condition. Individuals who are\\nnot diagnosed and treated are at an increased risk of syn-cope and sudden death. Adequate treatment can decreasethis risk. There is no cure. Individuals with one of theinherited forms of LQTS are at risk of passing the muta-tion and the disease to their offspring.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2725Prolonged QT syndrome'),\n",

Antibiotic prophylaxisis the focus of this article and refers to the use of antibi-\\notics to prevent infections.Purpose\\nAntibiotics are well known for their ability to treat\\ninfections. But some antibiotics also are prescribed to pre-\\nvent infections. This usually is done only in certain situa-\\ntions or for people with particular medical problems. Forexample, people with abnormal heart valves have a highrisk of developing heart valve infections after even minorsurgery. This happens because bacteria from other parts ofthe body get into the bloodstream during surgery and trav-el to the heart valves. To prevent these infections, peoplewith heart valve problems often take antibiotics beforehaving any kind of surgery, including dental surgery.\\nAntibiotics also may be prescribed to prevent infec-\\ntions in people with weakened immune systems, such aspeople with AIDS or people who are having chemother-\\napytreatments for cancer . But even healthy people with\\nstrong immune systems may occasionally be given pre-ventive antibiotics—if they are having certain kinds ofsurgery that carry a high risk of infection, or if they aretraveling to parts of the world where they are likely to getan infection that causes diarrhea , for example.\\nIn all of these situations, a physician should be the\\none to decide whether antibiotics are necessary. Unless aphysician says to do so, it is not a good idea to takeantibiotics to prevent ordinary infections.\\nBecause the overuse of antibiotics can lead to resis-\\ntance, drugs taken to prevent infection should be usedonly for a short time.\\nDescription\\nAmong the drugs used for antibiotic prophylaxis are\\namoxicillin (a type of penicillin) and fluoroquinolones\\nsuch as ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and trovafloxacin (Trovan).These drugs are available only with a physician’s prescrip-tion and come in tablet, capsule, liquid, and injectableforms.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\nantibiotic prescribed and the reason it is being used. Forthe correct dosage, check with the physician or dentistwho prescribed the medicine or the pharmacist whofilled the prescription. Be sure to take the medicineexactly as prescribed. Do not take more or less thandirected, and take the medicine only for as long as thephysician or dentist says to take it.\\nPrecautions\\nIf the medicine causes nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea,\\ncheck with the physician or dentist who prescribed it as\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2726Prophylaxis'),\n",

Occasionally, it may also be\\nused to diagnose a condition called benign prostatichyperplasia that causes enlargement of the prostate. Inthe United States, prostate cancer is the most common\\ncancer among men over 50, and is the second leadingcause of cancer deaths.\\nProstate biopsy is recommended when a digital rec-\\ntal examination (a routine screening test for prostate\\ndiseases) reveals a lump or some other abnormality in theprostate. In addition, if blood tests reveal that the levelsof certain markers, such as PSA, are above normal, thedoctor may order a biopsy.\\nDescription\\nThe prostate gland is one of the three male sex\\nglands and lies just below the urinary bladder, in the areabehind the penis and in front of the rectum. It secretessemen, the liquid portion of the ejaculate. The urethracarries the urine from the urinary bladder and the semenfrom the sex glands to the outside of the body.\\nProstate biopsies can be performed in three different\\nways. They can be performed by inserting a needlethrough the perineum (the area between the base of thepenis and the rectum), by inserting a needle through thewall of the rectum, or by cytoscopy. Before the proce-dure is performed, the patient may be given a sedative tohelp him relax. Patients undergoing cytoscopy may begiven either general anesthesia or local anesthesia. Thedoctor will ask the patient to have an enema before carry-ing out the biopsy. The patient is also given antibiotics\\nto prevent any possible infection.\\nNeedle biopsy via the perineum\\nThe patient lies either on one side or on his back with\\nhis knees up. The skin of the perineum is thoroughlycleansed with an iodine solution. A local anesthetic isinjected at the site where the biopsy is performed.

The doctor places one finger in the rec-tum to guide the placement of the needle. The needle isthen inserted into the prostate, a small amount of tissue iscollected, and the needle is withdrawn. The needle is thenre-inserted into another part of the prostate. Tissue maybe taken from several areas. Pressure is then applied at thebiopsy site to stop the bleeding. The procedure generallytakes 15-30 minutes and is usually done in a physician’soffice or in a hospital operating room. Though it soundspainful, it typically causes only slight discomfort.\\nNeedle biopsy via the rectum\\nThis procedure is also done in the physician’s office\\nor in the hospital operating room, and is usually donewithout any anesthetic. The patient is asked to lie on hisside or on his back with his legs in stirrups. The doctorattaches a curved needle guide to his finger and theninserts the finger into the rectum. After firmly placing theneedle guide in the rectum, the biopsy needle is pushedalong the guide, through the wall of the rectum and intothe prostate. The needle is rotated gently, prostate tissuesamples are collected and the needle withdrawn.\\nCytoscopy\\nFor this procedure, the patient is given either a general\\nor a local anesthetic. An instrument called a cytoscope (athin-lighted tube with telescopic lenses) is passed throughthe urethra. By looking through the cytoscope, the doctor\\ncan see if there is any blockage in the urethra and removeit. Tissue samples from the urinary bladder or the prostatecan be collected for microscopic examination.\\nThis test is generally performed in an operating\\nroom or in a physician’s office. An hour before the proce-dure, the patient is given a sedative to help him relax. Anintravenous (IV) line will be placed in a vein in the armto give medications and fluids if necessary. The patient isasked to lie on a special table with his knees apart andstirrups are used to support his feet and thighs. The geni-tal area is cleansed with an antiseptic solution. If generalanesthesia is being used, the patient is given the medica-tion through the IV tube or inhaled gases or both. If alocal anesthetic is being used, the anesthetic solution isgently instilled into the urethra.\\nAfter the area is numb, a cytoscope is inserted into\\nthe urethra and slowly pushed into the prostate. Tiny for-ceps or scissors are inserted through the cytoscope to col-lect small pieces of tissue that are used for biopsy. Thecytoscope is then withdrawn. The entire procedure maytake 30–45 minutes. Sometimes a catheter (tube) is leftin the urinary bladder to help the urine drain out, until theswelling in the urethra has subsided.\\nAlternate procedures\\nMany different tests can be performed to diagnose\\nprostate diseases and cancer.

Blood tests thatmeasure the levels of certain protein markers, such asPSA, can indicate the presence of prostate cancer cells. Xrays and other imaging techniques (such as computed\\ntomography scans ,magnetic resonance imaging , and\\nultrasonograms), where detailed pictures of areas insidethe body are put together by a computer, can also be usedto determine the extent and spread of the disease. Howev-er, a prostate biopsy and examination of the cells under amicroscope remains the most definitive test for diagnosingand grading prostate cancer.\\nPreparation\\nBefore scheduling the biopsy, the doctor should be\\nmade aware of all the medications that the patient is tak-ing, if the patient is allergic to any medication, and if hehas any bleeding problems. The patient may be given anantibiotic shortly before the test to reduce the risk of anyinfection afterwards. If the biopsy is done through theperineum, there are no special preparations. If it is beingdone through the rectum, the patient is asked to take anenema and is instructed on how to do it.\\nIf a cytoscopy is being performed, the patient is\\nasked to sign a consent form. The patient is also asked totake antibiotics before and for several days after the testto prevent infection due to insertion of the instruments. Ifa general anesthetic is going to be used, food and liquidswill be restricted for at least eight hours before the test.\\nAftercare\\nFollowing a needle biopsy, the patient may experi-\\nence some pain and discomfort. He should avoid strenu-\\nous activities for the rest of the day. He may also noticesome blood in his urine for two to three days after thetest and some amount of rectal bleeding. If there is per-sistent bleeding, pain, or fever , and if the patient is\\nunable to urinate for 24 hours, the doctor should be noti-fied immediately.\\nWhen a cytoscopy is performed under a local anes-\\nthetic, the patient is asked to lie down for 30 minutesafter the test and is then allowed to go. If general anes-thesia is used, the patient is taken to the recovery roomand kept there until he wakes up and is able to walk. Heis allowed food and liquids after he wakes up. After gen-eral anesthesia, the patient may experience some tired-ness and aching of the muscles throughout the body. Iflocal anesthesia was administered, there is a brief burn-ing sensation and a strong urge to urinate when the cyto-scope is removed.After the procedure, it is common to experience fre-\\nquent urination with a burning sensation for a few days.Drinking a lot of fluids will help reduce the burning sen-sation and the chances of an infection. There may also besome blood in the urine. However, if blood clots are seen,or if the patient is unable to pass urine eight hours afterthe cytoscopy, the doctor should be notified. In addition,if the patient develops a high fever, and complains ofchills or abdominal pain after the procedure, he shouldsee the doctor right away.\\nRisks\\nProstate biopsy performed with a needle is a low-\\nrisk procedure. The possible complications include somebleeding into the urethra, an infection, or an inability tourinate. These complications are treatable and the doctorshould be notified of them.\\nCytoscopy is generally a very safe procedure. The\\nmost common complication is an inability to urinate dueto a swelling of the urethra. A catheter (tube) may have tobe inserted to help drain out the urine. If there is an infec-tion after the procedure, antibiotics are given to treat it. Invery rare instances, the urethra or the urinary bladder maybe perforated because of the insertion of the instrument. Ifthis occurs, surgery may be needed to repair the damage.\\nNormal results\\nIf the prostate tissue samples show no sign of\\ninflammation, and if no cancerous cells are detected, theresults are normal.\\nAbnormal results\\nAnalysis of the prostate tissue under the microscope\\nreveals any abnormalities. In addition, the presence ofcancerous cells can be detected. If a tumor is present, thepathologist “grades” the tumor, in order to estimate howaggressive the tumor is. The most commonly used grad-ing system is called the “Gleason system.”\\nNormal prostate tissue has certain characteristic fea-\\ntures that the cancerous tissue lacks. In the Gleason sys-tem, prostate cancers are graded by how closely theyresemble normal prostate tissue. The system assigns agrade ranging from 1 to 5. The grades assigned to twoareas of cancer are added up for a combined score that isbetween 2 and 10. A score between 2 and 4 is called lowand implies that the cancer is a slow-growing one. AGleason score of 8 to 10 is high and indicates that thecancer is aggressive. The higher the Gleason score, themore likely it is that the cancer is fast-growing and mayhave already grown out of the prostate and spread toother areas (metastasized).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2729Prostate biopsy'),\n",

Along with the testicles and the semi-nal vesicles, the prostate secretes the fluid that makes upsemen. The prostate is about the size of a walnut and liesjust behind the urinary bladder. A tumor in the prostateinterferes with proper control of the bladder and normalsexual functioning. Often the first symptom of prostatecancer is difficulty in urinating. However, because avery common, non-cancerous condition of the prostate,benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), also causes thesame problem, difficulty in urination is not necessarilydue to cancer.\\nCancerous cells within the prostate itself are gener-\\nally not deadly on their own. However, as the tumorgrows, some of the cells break off and spread to otherparts of the body through the lymph or the blood, aprocess known as metastasis. The most common sites forprostate cancer to metastasize are the seminal vesicles,the lymph nodes, the lungs, and various bones around thehips and the pelvic region. The effects of these newtumors are what can cause death .\\nSecond only to skin cancer, the American Cancer\\nSociety estimates that in 2000 at least 180,400 new casesof prostate cancer were diagnosed. Of this number, thedisease will cause at least 31,900 deaths. Althoughprostate cancer is often very slow growing, it can beaggressive, especially in younger men. Given its slowgrowing nature, many men with the disease die of othercauses rather than from the cancer itself.\\nProstate cancer affects African-American men twice\\nas often as white men and the mortality rate amongAfrican-Americans is also two times higher. African-Americans have the highest rate of prostate cancer of anyworld population group.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe precise cause of prostate cancer is not known.\\nHowever, there are several known risk factors for diseaseincluding age over 55, African-American heritage, afamily history of the disease, occupational exposure tocadmium or rubber, and a high fat diet. Men with highplasma testosterone levels may also have an increasedrisk for developing prostate cancer.\\nFrequently, prostate cancer has no symptoms and the\\ndisease is diagnosed when the patient goes for a routinescreening examination. However, when the tumor is bigor the cancer has spread to the nearby tissues, the follow-ing symptoms may be seen:\\n• weak or interrupted flow of the urine• frequent urination (especially at night)\\n• difficulty starting urination\\n• inability to urinate•pain or burning sensation when urinating\\n• blood in the urine\\n• persistent pain in lower back, hips, or thighs (bone\\npain)\\n• painful ejaculation.\\nDiagnosis\\nProstate cancer is curable when detected early. Yet\\nthe early stages of prostate cancer are often asympto-matic, so the disease often goes undetected until thepatient has a routine physical examination . Diagnosis of\\nprostate cancer can be made using some or all of the fol-lowing tests.\\nDigital rectal examination (DRE)\\nIn order to perform this test, the doctor puts a\\ngloved, lubricated finger (digit) into the rectum to feelfor any lumps in the prostate. The rectum lies just behindthe prostate gland, and a majority of prostate tumors\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2730Prostate cancer'),\n",

If the doctor\\ndoes detect an abnormality, he or she may order moretests in order to confirm these findings.\\nBlood tests\\nBlood tests are used to measure the amounts of cer-\\ntain protein markers, such as prostate-specific antigen(PSA), found circulating in the blood. The cells liningthe prostate generally make this protein and a smallamount can be detected normally in the bloodstream. Incontrast, prostate cancers produce a lot of this protein,significantly raising the circulating levels. A finding of aPSA level higher than normal for the patient’s age grouptherefore suggests that cancer is present.\\nTransrectal ultrasound\\nA small probe is placed in the rectum and sound\\nwaves are released from the probe. These sound wavesbounce off the prostate tissue and an image is created.Since normal prostate tissue and prostate tumors reflectthe sound waves differently, the test is an efficient andaccurate way to detect tumors. Though the insertion of theprobe into the rectum may be slightly uncomfortable, theprocedure is generally painless and takes only 20 minutes.Prostate biopsy\\nIf cancer is suspected from the results of any of the\\nabove tests, the doctor will remove a small piece ofprostate tissue with a hollow needle. This sample is thenchecked under the microscope for the presence of can-cerous cells. Prostate biopsy is the most definitive diag-\\nnostic tool for prostate cancer.\\nProstate cancer can also be diagnosed based on the\\nexamination of the tissue removed during a transurethralresection of the prostate (TURP). This procedure is per-formed to help alleviate the symptoms of BPH, a benignenlargement of the prostate. Like a biopsy, this is a defin-itive diagnostic method for prostate cancer.\\nX rays and imaging techniques\\nA chest x ray may be ordered to determine whether\\nthe cancer has spread to the lungs. Imaging techniques(such as computed tomography scans (CT) and mag-\\nnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), where a computer is\\nused to generate a detailed picture of the prostate andareas nearby, may be done to get a clearer view of theinternal organs. A bone scan may be used to checkwhether the cancer has spread to the bone.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2731Prostate cancer\\nKEY TERMS\\nAntiandrogen —A substance that blocks the action\\nof androgens, the hormones responsible for malecharacteristics.

Thepathologist scores the appearance of the biopsy sampleusing the Gleason system. This system uses a scale ofone to five based on the sample’s similarity or dissimilar-ity to normal prostate tissue. If the tissue is very similarto normal tissue, it is still well differentiated and given alow grading number, such as one or two. As the tissuebecomes more and more abnormal (less and less differ-entiated), the grading number increases, up to five. Lessdifferentiated tissue is considered more aggressive andmore likely to be the source of metastases.\\nThe Gleason grading system is best predictive of the\\nprognosis of a patient if the pathologist gives two scoresto a particular sample—a primary and a secondary pat-tern. The two numbers are then added together and that isthe Gleason score reported to the patient. Thus, the lowestGleason score available is two (a primary and secondarypattern score of one each). A typical Gleason score is five(which can be a primary score of two and a secondaryscore of three or visa-versa). The highest score availableis 10, with a pure pattern of very undifferentiated tissue,that is, of grade five. The higher the score, the moreabnormal behavior of the tissue, the greater the chance formetastases, and the more serious the prognosis after sur-gical treatment. A study found that the ten-year cancersurvival rate without evidence of disease for grade two,three, and four cancers is 94% of patients. The rate is 91%for grade five cancers, 78% for grade six, 46% for gradeseven, and 23% for grade eight, nine, and ten cancers.\\nCancer staging\\nThe second numeric score determined by the doctor\\nwill be the stage of the cancer, which takes into accountthe grade of the tumor determined by the pathologist.Based on the recommendations of the American JointCommittee on Cancer (AJCC), two kinds of data are usedfor staging prostate cancer. Clinical data are based on theexternal symptoms of the cancer, while histopathologicaldata is based on surgical removal of the prostate andexamination of its tissues. Clinical data are most useful tomake treatment decisions, while pathological data is thebest predictor of prognosis. For this reason, the staging ofprostate cancer takes into account both clinical andhistopathologic information. Specifically, doctors look at\\ntumor size (T), lymph node involvement (N), the presenceof visceral (internal organ) involvement (metastasis = M),and the grade of the tumor (G).\\nThe classification of tumor as T1 means the cancer\\nthat is confined to the prostate gland and the tumor that istoo small to be felt during a DRE. T1 tumors are oftenfound after examination of tissue removed during aTURP. The T1 definition is subdivided into those cancersthat show less than 5% cancerous cells in the tissue sam-ple (T1a) or more than 5% cancerous cells in the tissuesample (T1b). T1c means that the biopsy was performedbased on an elevated PSA result. The second tumor clas-sification is T2, where the tumor is large enough to befelt during the DRE. T2a indicates that only the left orthe right side of the gland is involved, while T2b meansboth sides of the prostate gland has tumor.\\nWith a T3 tumor the cancer has spread to the con-\\nnective tissue near the prostate (T3a) or to the seminalvesicles as well (T3b). T4 indicates that cancer hasspread within the pelvis to tissue next to the prostate suchas the bladder’s sphincter, the rectum, or the wall of thepelvis. Prostate cancer tends to spread next into theregional lymph nodes of the pelvis, indicated as N1.Prostate cancer is said to be at the M1 stage when it hasmetastasized outside the pelvis in distant lymph nodes(M1a), bone (M1b) or organs such as the liver or thebrain (M1c). Pain, weight loss, and fatigue often accom-pany the M1 stage.\\nThe grade of the tumor (G) can assessed during a\\nbiopsy, TURP surgery, or after removal of the prostate.There are three grades recognized: G1, G2, and G3, indi-cating the tumor is well, moderately, or poorly differenti-ated, respectively. The G, LN, M descriptions are com-bined with the T definition to determine the stage of theprostate cancer.\\nStage I prostate cancer comprises patients that are\\nT1a, N0, M0, G1. Stage II includes a variety of conditioncombinations including T1a, N0, M0, G2, 3 or 4; T1b,N0, M0, Any G; T1c, N0, M0, Any G; T1, N0, M0, AnyG or T2, N0, M0, Any G. The prognosis for cancers atthese two stages is very good. For men treated with stageI or stage II disease, over 95% are alive after five years.\\nStage III prostate cancer occurs when conditions are\\nT3, N0, M0, any G. Stage IV is T4, N0, M0, any G; anyT, N1, M0, any G; or any T, any N, M1, Any G. Althoughthe cancers of Stage III are more advanced, the five yearprognosis is still good, with 70% of men diagnosed atthese stage still living. The spread of the cancer into thepelvis (T4), lymph (N1), or distant locations (M1) arevery significant events, as the five year survival ratedrops to 30% for Stage IV .\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2732Prostate cancer'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 439}, page_content='Treatment options\\nThe doctor and the patient will decide on the treat-\\nment mode after considering many factors. For example,the patient’s age, the stage of the disease, his generalhealth, and the presence of any co-existing illnesses haveto be considered. In addition, the patient’s personal prefer-ences and the risks and benefits of each treatment protocolare also taken into account before any decision is made.\\nSURGERY. For stage I and stage II prostate cancer,\\nsurgery is the most common method of treatmentbecause it theoretically offers the chance of completelyremoving the cancer from the body. Radical prostatecto-\\nmyinvolves complete removal of the prostate. The\\nsurgery can be done using a perineal approach, where theincision is made between the scrotum and the anus, orusing a retropubic approach, where the incision is madein the lower abdomen. Perineal approach is also knownas nerve-sparing prostatectomy, as it is thought to reducethe effect on the nerves and thus reduce the side effectsof impotence and incontinence. However, the retropubicapproach allows for the simultaneous removal of thepelvic lymph nodes, which can give important pathologi-cal information about the tumor spread.\\nThe drawback to surgical treatment for early prostate\\ncancer is the significant risk of side effects that impact thequality of life of the patient. Even using nerve-sparing tech-niques, studies run by the National Cancer Institute (NCI)found that 60–80% of men treated with radical prostatecto-my reported themselves as impotent (unable to achieve anerection sufficient for sexual intercourse) two years aftersurgery. This side effect can be sometimes countered byprescribing sildenafil citrate (Viagra). Furthermore, 8% to10% of patients were incontinent in that time span. Despitethe side effects, the majority of men were reported as satis-fied with their treatment choice. Additionally, there is someevidence that the skill and the experience of the surgeon arecentral factors in the ultimate side effects seen.\\nA second method of surgical treatment of prostate\\ncancer is cryosurgery. Guided by ultrasound, surgeonsinsert up to eight cryoprobes through the skin and intoclose proximity with the tumor. Liquid nitrogen (temper-ature of -320.8°F, or -196°C) is circulated through theprobe, freezing the tumor tissue. In prostate surgery, awarming tube is also used to keep the urethra from freez-ing. Patients currently spend a day or two in the hospitalfollowing the surgery, but it could be an outpatient proce-dure in the near future. Recovery time is about one week.Side effects have been reduced in recent years, althoughimpotence still affects almost all who have hadcryosurgery for prostate cancer. Cryosurgery is consid-ered a good alternative for those too old or sick to havetraditional surgery or radiation treatments or when thesemore traditional treatments are unsuccessful. There is a\\nlimited amount of information about the long-term effi-cacy of this treatment for prostate cancer.\\nRADIATION THERAPY. Radiation therapy involves\\nthe use of high-energy x rays to kill cancer cells or toshrink tumors. It can be used instead of surgery for stageI and II cancer. The radiation can either be administeredfrom a machine outside the body (external beam radia-tion), or small radioactive pellets can be implanted in theprostate gland in the area surrounding the tumor, calledbrachytherapy or interstitial implantation. Pellets con-taining radioactive iodine (I-125), palladium (Pd 103), oriridium (Ir 192) can be implanted on an outpatient basis,where they remain permanently. The radioactive effect ofthe seeds last only about a year.\\nThe side effects of radiation can include inflamma-\\ntion of the bladder, rectum, and small intestine. Impo-\\ntence and incontinence are often delayed side effects of\\nthe treatment. A study indicated that bowel control prob-lems were more likely after radiation therapy when com-pared to surgery, but impotent and incontinence weremore likely after surgical treatment. Long-term resultswith radiation therapy are dependent on stage. A reviewof almost 1000 patients treated with megavoltage irradia-tion showed 10 year survival rates to be significantly dif-ferent by T-stage: T1 (79%), T2 (66%), T3 (55%), and T4(22%). There does not appear to be a large difference insurvival between external beam or interstitial treatments.\\nHORMONE THERAPY. Hormone therapy is common-\\nly used when the cancer is in an advanced stage and hasspread to other parts of the body, such as stage III orstage IV . Prostate cells need the male hormone testos-terone to grow. Decreasing the levels of this hormone, orinhibiting its activity, will cause the cancer to shrink.Hormone levels can be decreased in several ways.Orchiectomy is a surgical procedure that involves com-plete removal of the testicles, leading to a decrease in thelevels of testosterone. Another method “tricks” the bodyby administering the female hormone estrogen. Whenthis is given, the body senses the presence of a sex hor-mone and stops making the male hormone testosterone.However, there are some unpleasant side effects to hor-mone therapy. Men may have “hot flashes,” enlargementand tenderness of the breasts, or impotence and loss ofsexual desire, as well as blood clots, heart attacks, andstrokes, depending on the dose of estrogen.\\nWATCHFUL WAITING. Watchful waiting means no\\nimmediate treatment is recommended, but doctors keepthe patient under careful observation. This is often doneusing periodic PSA tests. This option is generally used inolder patients when the tumor is not very aggressive andthe patients have other, more life-threatening, illnesses.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2733Prostate cancer'),\n",

The mixture is called PC-SPES and isbelieved to stimulate the production of hormones in thebody. In a small study, the herbal mixture causes a dropof 52% in PSA levels for 87% of the study participants.The herb mixture does have side effects, including bloodclots and nipple tenderness and the potency of the herbssuffers from batch variation.\\nPrevention\\nBecause the cause of the cancer is not known, there is\\nno definite way to prevent prostate cancer. Given its com-mon occurrence and the low cost of screening, the Ameri-can Cancer Society (ACS) and the National Comprehen-sive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends that all menover age 40 have an annual rectal examination and that\\nmen have an annual PSA test beginning at age 50. African-American men and men with a family history of prostatecancer, who have a higher than average risk, should beginannual PSA testing even earlier, starting at age 45.\\nHowever, mandatory screening for prostate cancer is\\ncontroversial. Because the cancer is so slow growing,and the side effects of the treatment can have significantimpact on patient quality of life, some medical organiza-tions question the wisdom of yearly exams. Some organi-zations have even noted that the effect of screening isdiscovering the cancer at an early stage when it maynever grow to have any outward effect on the patient dur-ing their lifetime. Nevertheless, the NCI reports that thecurrent aggressive screening methods have achieved areduction in the death rate of prostate cancer of about2.3% for African-Americans and about 4.6% for Cau-casians since the mid-1990s, with a 20% increase inoverall survival rate during that period.\\nA low fat diet may slow the progression of prostate\\ncancer. To reduce the risk or progression of prostate can-cer, the American Cancer Society recommends a diet richin fruits, vegetables and dietary fiber, and low in red meatand saturated fats.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCarroll, Peter R., et al. “Cancer of the Prostate.” In Cancer Prin-\\nciples and Practice of Oncology, Devita, Vincent T., et al.,\\neds.

If the\\nPSA test is positive, a sample of prostate tissue (biopsy)may be taken to confirm that cancer is present. If nega-tive, the test may be repeated immediately to confirm thediagnosis, or repeated the next year. Many physicianstoday routinely do both a DRE and a PSA test each yearon their older male patients, so that, if cancer does devel-op, it will be found at an early stage will be easier totreat. The combination of a DRE and a PSA test candetect approximately 80% of all prostate cancers.\\nAt present, the PSA test is widely accepted as a way\\nof telling whether a patient with definite cancer isresponding to treatment. Because only the prostate pro-duces PSA, its presence in the blood following completeremoval of the prostate (radical prostatectomy ) indi-\\ncates that some cancer has been left behind.\\nPrecautions\\nThere is no physical reason not to do a PSA test.\\nAlthough, the level of PSA usually is elevated in menwith prostate cancer, it also may be abnormally high(though usually not ashigh) in men with non-cancerous\\nenlargement of the prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasiaor BPH). If thousands of men have the PSA test routinelyeach year, many of them will have unnecessary tests (suchas biopsy or an ultrasound study) to confirm cancer. If a“false-positive” result is obtained, where the PSA levelseems high but really is not, some men may even be treat-ed for prostate cancer when no cancer is present. Both theAmerican Cancer Society and the American UrologicalAssociation urge annual PSA testing to detect early can-cers, but the National Cancer Institute does not.\\nDescription\\nThe PSA test is a radioimmunoassay. Any antigen\\ncauses the body to produce antibodies in an attempt toneutralize or eliminate the antigen, often a substance thatharms body tissues. In the laboratory, a sample of thepatient’s blood is exposed to the antibody against PSA,so that the amount of antigen (PSA) can be measured.The results generally are available the next day.\\nPreparation\\nNo special measures are needed when doing a PSA\\ntest other than taking the usual precautions to preventinfection at the needle puncture site.\\nNormal results\\nEach laboratory has its own normal range for PSA.\\nIn fact, they may redefine the normal range wheneverstarting to use a new batch of test chemicals.Abnormal results\\nSome experts believe that more than 90% of men\\nwith prostate cancer will have an elevated PSA level.Others claim that as many as one-third of cancers will bemissed. The amount of PSA in the blood drops whencancer is successfully treated, but rises again if the tumorrecurs, especially if it spreads to other parts of the body.A new variation of the PSA test shows how much of thematerial is bound to other protein in the blood and howmuch is “free.” This procedure may be more accurate andcould well indicate whether either prostate cancer orBPH is present.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nFox, Arnold, and Barry Fox.

Anultrasound test uses very high frequency sound wavesthat are passed through the body. The pattern of reflect-ed sound waves, or “echoes,” shows the outline of theprostate. This test can show whether the prostate isenlarged, and whether an abnormal growth that might becancer is present.\\nPurpose\\nThe prostate is a chestnut-shaped organ surrounding\\nthe beginning of the urethra in men. It produces a milkyfluid that is part of the seminal fluid discharged duringejaculation. The prostate can become enlarged, particu-larly in men over age 50. Also, cancer of the prostate candevelop, which tends to affect older men.\\nDuring a physical examination , a doctor may per-\\nform a digital rectal examination . In this examination,\\nthe doctor uses a gloved and lubricated finger inserted inthe rectum to feel for any abnormalities. If this examina-tion shows that the prostate is enlarged or a hard lump ispresent, an ultrasound may be done. Another reason adoctor might perform an ultrasound is if a blood testshows abnormal levels of a substance called prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Abnormal levels of PSA mayindicate the presence of cancer.\\nIf there is a suspicious lump, the doctor will want to\\ntake a sample of some of the tissue ( prostate biopsy ) to\\ntest it to see whether it is in fact cancer. Doing an ultra-sound first will show the doctor what part of the prostateshould be taken as a sample. Ultrasound can also showwhether cancerous tissue is still only within the prostateor whether it has begun to spread to other locations. Ifprostate cancer is present and the doctor decides to treat\\nit with a surgical freezing procedure, ultrasound is usedas an aid in the procedure.\\nAn ultrasound can reveal other types of prostate dis-\\nease as well. For example, it can show if there is inflam-mation of the prostate ( prostatitis ). Sometimes it is\\nused to learn why a man is unable to father children(infertility ).\\nPrecautions\\nA prostate ultrasound study is generally not per-\\nformed on men who have recently had surgery on theirlower bowel. This is because the test requires placing anultrasound probe about the size of a finger into the rectum.Description\\nProstate ultrasound is generally done using a tech-\\nnique called the transrectal method. This procedure canbe done in an outpatient clinic. The cylinder-shapedultrasound probe is gently placed in the rectum as thepatient lies on his left side with the knees bent. The probeis rocked back and forth to obtain images of the entireprostate. The procedure takes about 15–25 minutes toperform. After the test, the patient’s doctor can be noti-fied right away, and usually he or she will have a writtenreport within 36 hours.\\nPreparation\\nTo prepare for a prostate ultrasound, an enema is\\ntaken two to four hours before the exam. The patientshould not urinate for one hour before the test. If biopsiesmay be done, the doctor will prescribe an antibiotic thatusually is taken in four doses starting the night before thebiopsy, the morning of the test, that evening, and the fol-lowing morning.\\nAftercare\\nThere is some discomfort, but less than most patients\\nexpect. In fact, worrying ahead of time is usually the hard-est part. Generally, the patient is allowed to leave after aradiologist or urologist has reviewed the results. There maybe some mucus or a small amount of bleeding from the rec-tum after the ultrasound. Some patients notice a smallamount of blood in the urine for up to two days after thetest. Blood may also be present in the semen. As long as theamount of blood is small, there is no cause for concern.\\nRisks\\nThere are no serious risks from a prostate ultrasound\\nstudy. Infection is rare and probably is a result of biopsyrather than the sonogram itself. If the ultrasound probe ismoved too vigorously, some bleeding may continue for afew days.\\nNormal results\\nModern ultrasound techniques can display both the\\nsmooth-surfaced outer shell of the prostate and the coretissues surrounding the urethra. The entire volume of theprostate should be less than 20 milliliters, and its outlineshould appear as a smooth echo-reflecting (echogenic)rim.

This condition, benign prostatic hyper-KEY TERMS\\nBenign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) —Benign pro-\\nstatic hypertrophy is an enlargement of theprostate that is not cancerous. However, it maycause problems with urinating or other symptoms.\\nProstate-specific antigen (PSA) —A substance that\\noften is produced by cancers of the prostate. It canbe detected in a blood test.\\nUrethra —The tube through which urine passes\\nfrom the bladder and is excreted to outside thebody.plasia (BPH) is present in more than half of men in their\\n60s and as many as 90% of those over 90. Because theprostate surrounds the urethra, the tube leading urinefrom the bladder out of the body, the enlarging prostatenarrows this passage and makes urination difficult. Thebladder does not empty completely each time a man uri-nates, and, as a result, he must urinate with greater fre-quency, night and day. In time, the bladder can overfill,and urine escapes from the urethra, resulting in inconti-nence. An operation called transurethral resection of theprostate (TURP) relieves symptoms of BPH by removingthe prostate tissue that is blocking the urethra. No inci-sion is needed. Instead a tube (retroscope) is passedthrough the penis to the level of the prostate, and tissue iseither removed or destroyed, so that urine can freely passfrom the body.\\nMalignant disease\\nProstate cancer is the single most common form of\\nnon-skin cancer in the United States and the most com-mon cancer in men over 50. Half of men over 70 and\\nalmost all men over the age of 90 have prostate cancer, andthe American Cancer Society estimates that 198,000 newcases will be diagnosed in 2001. This condition does notalways require surgery. In fact, many elderly men adopt apolicy of “watchful waiting,” especially if their cancer isgrowing slowly. Younger men often elect to have theirprostate gland totally removed along with the cancer itcontains—an operation called radical prostatectomy. Thetwo main types of this surgery, radical retropubic prostate-ctomy and radical perineal prostatectomy, are performedonly on patients whose cancer is limited to the prostate. Ifcancer has broken out of the capsule surrounding theprostate gland and spread in the area or to distant sites,removing the prostate will not prevent the remaining can-cer from growing and spreading throughout the body.\\nPrecautions\\nPotential complications of TURP include bleeding,\\ninfection, and reactions to general or local anesthesia .\\nAbout one man in five will need to have the operationagain within 10 years.\\nOpen (incisional) prostatectomy for cancer should\\nnot be done if the cancer has spread beyond the prostate,as serious side effects may occur without the benefit ofremoving all the cancer. If the bladder is retaining urine,it is necessary to insert a catheter before starting surgery.Patients should be in the best possible general conditionbefore radical prostatectomy. Before surgery, the bladderis inspected using an instrument called a cystoscope tohelp determine the best surgical technique to use, and torule out other local problems.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2737Prostatectomy'),\n",

With the patient under either general or spinal anes-thesia, a cutting instrument or heated wire loop is insertedto remove as much prostate tissue as possible and sealblood vessels. The excised tissue is washed into the blad-der, then flushed out at the end of the operation. Acatheter is left in the bladder for one to five days to drainurine and blood. Advanced laser technology enables sur-geons to safely and effectively burn off excess prostatetissue blocking the bladder opening with fewer of theearly and late complications associated with other formsof prostate surgery. This procedure can be performed onan outpatient basis, but urinary symptoms do not improveuntil swelling subsides several weeks after surgery.\\nRadical prostatectomy\\nRADICAL RETROPUBIC PROSTATECTOMY. This is a\\nuseful approach if the prostate is very large, or cancer issuspected. With the patient under general or spinal anes-thesia or an epidural, a horizontal incision is made in thecenter of the lower abdomen. Some surgeons begin theoperation by removing pelvic lymph nodes to determinewhether cancer has invaded them, but recent findingssuggest there is no need to sample them in patientswhose likelihood of lymph node metastases is less than18%. A doctor who removes the lymph nodes for exami-nation will not continue the operation if they contain can-cer cells, because the surgery will not cure the patient.Other surgeons remove the prostate gland before examin-ing the lymph nodes. A tube (catheter) inserted into thepenis to drain fluid from the body is left in place for14–21 days.\\nOriginally, this operation also removed a thin rim of\\nbladder tissue in the area of the urethral sphincter—amuscular structure that keeps urine from escaping fromthe bladder. In addition, the nerves supplying the penisoften were damaged, and many men found themselvesimpotent (unable to achieve erections) after prostatecto-my. A newer surgical method called potency-sparing rad-ical prostatectomy preserves sexual potency in 75% ofpatients and fewer than 5% become incontinent follow-ing this procedure.\\nRADICAL PERINEAL PROSTATECTOMY. This proce-\\ndure is just as curative as radical retropubic prostatectomybut is performed less often because it does not allow thesurgeon to spare the nerves associated with erection or,because the incision is made above the rectum and belowthe scrotum, to remove lymph nodes. Radical perinealprostatectomy is sometimes used when the cancer is lim-ited to the prostate and there is no need to spare nerves or\\nwhen the patient’s health might be compromised by thelonger procedure. The perineal operation is less invasivethan retropubic prostatectomy. Some parts of the prostatecan be seen better, and blood loss is limited. The absenceof an abdominal incision allows patients to recover morerapidly. Many urologic surgeons have not been trained toperform this procedure. Radical prostatectomy proce-dures last one to four hours, with radical perineal prosta-tectomy taking less time than radical retropubic prostatec-tomy. The patient remains in the hospital three to fivedays following surgery and can return to work in three tofive weeks. Ongoing research indicates that laparoscopicradical prostatectomy may be as effective as open surgeryin treatment of early-stage disease.\\nCryosurgery\\nAlso called cryotherapy or cryoablation, this mini-\\nmally invasive procedure uses very low temperatures tofreeze and destroy cancer cells in and around the prostategland. A catheter circulates warm fluid through the ure-thra to protect it from the cold. When used in connectionwith ultrasound imaging, cryosurgery permits very pre-cise tissue destruction. Traditionally used only in patientswhose cancer had not responded to radiation, but nowapproved by Medicare as a primary treatment forprostate cancer, cryosurgery can safely be performed onolder men, on patients who are not in good enough gen-eral health to undergo radical prostatectomy, or to treatrecurrent disease. Recent studies have shown that totalcryosurgery, which destroys the prostate, is at least aseffective as radical prostatectomy without the trauma ofmajor surgery.\\nPreparation\\nAs with any type of major surgery done under gen-\\neral anesthesia , the patient should be in optimal condi-\\ntion. Most patients having prostatectomy are in the agerange when cardiovascular problems are frequent, mak-ing it especially important to be sure that the heart isbeating strongly, and that the patient is not retaining toomuch fluid. Because long-standing prostate disease maycause kidney problems from urine “backing up,” it also isnecessary to be sure that the kidneys are working proper-ly. If not, a period of catheter drainage may be necessarybefore doing the surgery.\\nAftercare\\nFollowing TURP, a catheter is placed in the bladder\\nto drain urine and remains in place for two to three days.A solution is used to irrigate the bladder and urethra untilthe urine is clear of blood, usually within 48 hours after\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2738Prostatectomy'),\n",

Catheter drainage also is usedafter open prostatectomy. The bladder is irrigated only ifblood clots block the flow of urine through the catheter.Patients are given intravenous fluids for the first 24hours, to ensure good urine flow. Patients resting in bedfor long periods are prone to blood clots in their legs(which can pass to the lungs and cause serious breathingproblems). This can be prevented by elastic stockingsand by periodically exercising the patient’s legs. Thepatient remains in the hospital one to two days followingsurgery and can return to work in one to two weeks.\\nRisks\\nThe complications and side effects that may occur\\nduring and after prostatectomy include:\\n• Excessive bleeding, which in rare cases may require\\nblood transfusion .\\n• Incontinence when, during retropubic prostatectomy,\\nthe muscular valve (sphincter) that keeps urine in thebladder is damaged. Less common today, when care istaken not to injure the sphincter.\\n•Impotence , occurring when nerves to the penis are\\ninjured during the retropubic operation. Today’s“nerve-sparing” technique has drastically cut down onthis problem.\\n• Some patients who receive a large volume of irrigating\\nfluid after TURP develop high blood pressure, vomit-ing, trouble with their vision, and mental confusion.This condition is caused by a low salt level in the blood,and is reversed by giving salt solution.\\n• A permanent narrowing of the urethra, called a stric-\\nture, occasionally develops when the urethra is dam-aged during TURP.\\nNormal results\\nIn patients with BPH who have the TURP operation,\\nurination should become much easier and less frequent,and dribbling or incontinence should cease. In patientshaving radical prostatectomy for cancer, a successfuloperation will remove the tumor and prevent its spread toother areas of the body (metastasis). If examination oflymph nodes shows that cancer already had spreadbeyond the prostate at the time of surgery, other mea-sures are available to control the tumor.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nMarks, Sheldon.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 446}, page_content='tion, prostatitis may develop rapidly ( acute ) or slowly\\n(chronic ).\\nDescription\\nProstatitis may be the symptom-producing disease\\nof the genitourinary tract for which men most often seekmedical help. About 40% of visits to a specialist in geni-tourinary problems (urologist) are for prostatitis. Formsof prostate inflammation include acute and chronic bac-terial prostatitis and inflammation not caused by bacteri-al infection. A painful condition called prostatodynia ,\\nwhich may be caused by abnormal nerves or muscles inthe region, is also thought to be a form of prostatitis. Thechronic bacterial form is sometimes experienced by menwhose sex partners have a bacterial infection of the vagi-na, making this a sexually transmitted disease. Othercases occur when small stones form within the prostateand become infected. Sometimes infection is caused bypoor hygiene, surgical procedures, or even swimming inpolluted water.\\nThe sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea may\\nsometimes cause prostatitis, and tuberculosis may\\nspread to the prostate. Parasites and fungi may infect theprostate gland. Some men whose prostatitis is not causedby any microorganism have microscopic collections ofcells called granulomas in their prostate tissue. Whether\\nviruses also may cause prostatitis is debatable.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nHowever the inflammation may begin, it causes\\nblockages in the tiny glands within the prostate so thatsecretions build up, and the prostate swells. In acutecases, this swelling can occur very suddenly and causeconsiderable pain . When prostatitis develops gradually,\\ntrouble with the flow of urine may be the first symptom.Small stones may form, because the body attempts toneutralize bacteria by coating them with calcium. Thesestones may become infected themselves and make thecondition worse.\\nSymptoms and signs that are typically experienced\\nby men with prostatitis include:\\n• Difficulties in urinating. Most urinary problems are\\ncaused when the swollen prostate blocks the tube thatcarries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body(urethra). Patients feel the need to urinate more oftenthan usual, often urgently. Urination is sometimespainful. It is hard to start the flow of urine and difficultto totally empty the bladder. Patients wake up at nightto urinate. The stream may be weak or split. Dribblingafter attempts to urinate may leave embarrassing wetspots on clothing. In severe prostatitis blood or sand-like particles (small calcium collections) may be passed\\nin the urine.\\n• Pain. Besides pain when urinating, caused by prostate\\nswelling, stimulation of nerves in the prostate glandmay cause pain in the penis, one or both testicles, thelower stomach, the low back, and the area between thescrotum and the anus (perineum). Some patients experi-ence pain during or after ejaculation, whenever they sitdown or walk, or during bowel movements.\\n• Sex and fertility. The pain of prostatitis can make it\\nimpossible to enjoy sex. Men with prostatitis may betroubled by early release of sperm ( premature ejacula-\\ntion). Occasionally there is blood in the semen. Some\\nof the drugs prescribed to ease the flow of the urine candampen the desire to have sex. Because the normalprostate secretions make up part of the semen, prostati-tis may lower fertility by severely lowering the numberof sperm and making them less mobile.\\n• Psychological problems. A man with prostatitis who\\nfeels that nothing can be done and he “just has to livewith it” may experience serious depression. Low sexualdesire certainly contributes to depression.\\nA person with acute prostatitis may suddenly devel-\\nop fever and chills, along with rapidly developing uri-\\nnary symptoms and pain in the perineum or low back.This state is a medical emergency that demands immedi-ate medical help.\\nDiagnosis\\nMost often the symptoms and physical findings are\\nenough to form a diagnosis of prostatitis. When theexaminer inserts a finger in the rectum, the swollenprostate can be felt; it may be extremely tender whenprobed. Squeezing the gland slightly will produce a fewdrops of fluid that may be cultured to learn whether bac-\\nteria are present. The fluid typically contains a largenumber of white blood cells, especially the cells used tofight off infection ( macrophages ). Note: too much pres-\\nsure on the prostate can force bacteria into the blood andcause a serious general infection. Many patients withchronic bacterial prostatitis also have recurring urinarytract infections (diagnosed by examining and culturingurine samples). These infections can be an important clueto the diagnosis. If doubt remains, the urologist mayinsert a special instrument called a cystoscope through\\nthe penis to directly view the prostate from inside and seewhether it looks inflamed.\\nTreatment\\nAcute prostatitis is first treated with antibiotics .\\nEven though it may be difficult for drugs to actually get\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2740Prostatitis'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 447}, page_content='into the inflamed prostate, most patients do quickly get\\nbetter. If intravenous antibiotics are needed or the blad-der is retaining urine, a hospital stay may be necessary.Broad-spectrum antibiotics that work against most bacte-ria are used first. At the same time tests are done withsamples of prostatic fluid to determine which bacteriumis causing the infection, so that drugs can be prescribedto fight the specific germ. In chronic cases, the bestresults are obtained with a combination of the antibioticstrimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. Oral antibioticsshould be given for 1–3 months; longer, if necessary. If afungus or some other organism is causing infection, spe-cial drugs are available. If chronic prostatitis continuesdespite all medical efforts and is seriously affecting thepatient’s life, the prostate may be removed surgically.\\nNonbacterial prostatitis requires other measures to\\nrelieve urinary symptoms. These measures include drugsthat fight inflammation (steroids or nonsteroids) and atype of drug called an alpha-blocker that reduces muscletension. Reduced muscle tension eases urine flow, allow-ing the bladder to empty. A narrowed urethra may bewidened by placing a collapsed balloon at the site ofobstruction and expanding it. This procedure is calledballoon dilation . The effects of such dilation are usually\\ntemporary. Some physicians believe that stress is an\\nimportant factor in prostatitis, and therefore prescribediazepam (Valium) or another tranquilizer. The type ofprostatitis known as prostatodynia is usually treated witha combination of muscle relaxing drugs, heat, specialexercises, and sometimes a tranquilizer.\\nThere are a number of “tips” for relieving symptoms\\nof prostatitis. They are especially helpful early on, beforeantibiotics have a chance to cure infection, or for patientswith chronic or non-bacterial prostatitis:\\n• Hot sitz baths. Exposing the perineum to very hot water\\nfor 20 minutes or longer often relieves pain.\\n• Ice. When heat does not help, ice packs, or simply plac-\\ning a small ice cube in the rectum, may relieve pain forhours.\\n• Water. A patient who has to urinate very often may\\nwant to cut back on his fluid intake but this will causedehydration and increase the risk of bladder infection.\\nInstead, it is best to drink plenty of water.\\n• Diet. Most doctors recommend cutting out—or cutting\\ndown on—caffeine (as in coffee or tea), alcohol, andspicy or acid foods. Constipation should be avoided\\nbecause large, hard bowel movements may press on theswollen prostate and cause great pain. Bran cereals andwhole-grain breads are helpful.\\n• Exercise. It is especially important for patients with\\nchronic prostatitis to keep up their activity level. Sim-KEY TERMS\\nCulture —A test in which a sample of body fluid,\\nsuch as prostatic fluid, is placed on materials spe-cially formulated to grow microorganisms. A cul-ture is used to learn what type of bacterium iscausing infection.\\nCystoscope —A viewing instrument that is passed\\nup the urethra into the region of the prostate to geta good look at the organ “from the inside.”\\nEjaculation —The process by which semen (made\\nup in part of prostatic fluid) is ejected by the erectpenis.\\nGranuloma —A cluster of cells that form in tissue\\nthat has been inflamed for some time.\\nPerineum —An area close to the prostate, between\\nthe scrotum and anus.\\nply walking often will help (unless walking happens to\\nmake the pain worse).\\n• Frequent ejaculation. Ejaculating two or three times a\\nweek often is recommended, especially when takingantibiotics.\\nAlternative treatment\\nA treatment popularized in the Philippines is called\\n“prostate drainage.” At regular intervals, a finger isinserted into the rectum, to exert pressure on the prostateat the same time that an antibiotic treatment is given.Acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine also can be\\neffective in treating prostatitis. Nutritional supplementsthat support the prostate, including zinc, omega-3 fattyacids, several amino acids, and anti-inflammatory nutri-ents and herbs, can help reduce pain and promote heal-ing. Western herbal medicine recommends saw palmetto\\n(Serenoa repens) to support the prostate gland. Hot and\\ncold contrast sitz baths can help reduce inflammation.\\nPrognosis\\nMost patients with acute bacterial prostatitis are\\ncured if they receive proper antibiotic treatment. Everyeffort should be made to get a cure at the acute stagebecause chronic prostatitis can be much more difficult toeliminate. If the acute illness is notcontrolled, complica-\\ntions such as a localized infection (prostatic abscess ),\\nkidney infection, or infection of the blood (septicemia)may develop.

Turkington\\nProtein-calorie malnutrition seeProtein-\\nenergy malnutrition\\nProtein components test\\nDefinition\\nProtein components tests measure the amounts and\\ntypes of protein in the blood. Proteins are constituents ofmuscle, enzymes, hormones, transport proteins, hemoglo-bin, and other functional and structural elements of thebody. Albumin and globulin make up most of the proteinwithin the body and are measured in the total protein ofthe blood and other body fluids. Thus, the serum (blood)protein components test measures the total protein, aswell as its albumin and globulin components in the blood.\\nPurpose\\nThe protein components test is used to diagnose dis-\\neases that either affect proteins as a whole, or thatinvolve a single type of protein. The test is also used tomonitor the course of disease in certain cancers, intesti-nal and kidney protein-wasting states, immune disorders,liver dysfunction, and impaired nutrition .\\nPrecautions\\nDrugs that may cause increased protein levels\\ninclude the anabolic steroids, androgens (male hor-mones), growth hormone, insulin, and progesterone.Drugs that may decrease protein levels include estrogen,drugs poisonous to the liver, and oral contraceptives .\\nDescription\\nProteins are large molecules (complex organic com-\\npounds) that consist of amino acids, sugars, and lipids.KEY TERMS\\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) —The virus\\nthat causes AIDS.There are two main types of proteins: those that are made\\nof fiber and form the structural basis of body tissues,such as hair, skin, muscle, tendons, and cartilage; andglobular proteins (generally water soluble), which inter-act with many hormones, various other proteins in theblood, including hemoglobin and antibodies, and all theenzymes (substances that promote biochemical reactionsin the body).\\nProteins are needed in the diet to supply the body\\nwith amino acids. Ingested proteins are broken down inthe digestive system to amino acids, which are thenabsorbed and rebuilt into new body proteins. One of themost important functions of proteins in the body is tocontribute to the osmotic pressure (the movement ofwater between the bloodstream and tissues). An exampleof this is seen in diseases that result in damage to the fil-tering units of the kidneys ( nephrotic syndrome ). A\\nsevere loss of protein from the bloodstream into the urine(proteinuria) results, lowering the protein content of theblood and resulting in fluid retention, or edema .\\nAlbumin and globulin are two key components of\\nprotein. Albumin is made in the liver and constitutesapproximately 60% of the total protein. The main func-tion of albumin is to maintain osmotic pressure and tohelp transport certain blood constituents around the bodyvia the bloodstream. Because albumin is made in the liver,it is one element that is used to monitor liver function.\\nGlobulin is the basis for antibodies, glycoproteins\\n(protein-carbohydrate compounds), lipoproteins (pro-teins involved in fat transport), and clotting factors.Globulins are divided into three main groups, the alpha-,beta-, and gammaglobulins. Alphaglobulins includeenzymes produced by the lungs and liver, and haptoglo-bin, which binds hemoglobin together. The betaglobulinsconsist mostly of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), sub-stances involved in fat transport. All of the gammaglob-\\nulins are antibodies, proteins produced by the immune\\nsystem in response to infection, during allergic reaction,and after organ transplants.\\nBoth serum albumin and globulin are measures of\\nnutrition. Malnourished patients, especially aftersurgery, demonstrate greatly decreased protein levels,while burn patients and those who have protein-losingsyndromes show low levels despite normal synthesis.Pregnancy in the third trimester is also associated with\\nreduced protein levels.\\nThe relationship of albumin to globulin is deter-\\nmined by ratio, so when certain diseases cause the albu-min levels to drop, the globulin level will be increased bythe body in an effort to maintain a normal total proteinlevel. For example, when the liver is unable to synthesizesufficient albumin in chronic liver disease, the albumin\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2743Protein components test'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 450}, page_content='level will be low, but the globulin levels will be normal or\\nhigher than normal. In such cases, the protein compo-nents test is an especially valuable diagnostic aid becauseit determines the ratio of albumin to globulin, as well asthe total protein level. It should be noted, however, thatwhen globulin is provided as a calculation (total protein– albumin = globulin), the result is much less definitivethan other methods of determining globulin.\\nConsequently, when the albumin/globulin ratio (A/G\\nratio) is less than 1.0, more precise tests should beordered. These tests include protein electrophoresis ,a\\nmethod of separating the different blood proteins intogroups. If the protein electrophoresis indicates a rise, or“spike” at the globulin level, an even more specific testfor globulins, called immunoelectrophoresis , should be\\nordered to separate out the various globulins according totype. Some diseases characterized by dysproteinemia(derangement of the protein content of the blood), havetypical electrophoretic globulin peaks.\\nPreparation\\nUnless this is requested by the physician, there is no\\nneed that the patient restrict food or fluids before the test.\\nRisks\\nRisks posed by this test are minimal, but may\\ninclude slight bleeding from the blood-drawing site,fainting or lightheadedness after venipuncture, or\\nhematoma (blood accumulating under the puncture site).\\nNormal results\\nReference values vary from laboratory to laboratory,\\nbut can generally be found within the following ranges:Total protein: 6.4–8.3 g/dL; albumin: 3.5–5.0 g/dL; glob-ulin: 2.3–3.4 g/dL.\\nAbnormal results\\nIncreased total protein levels are seen in dehydra-\\ntion, in some cases of chronic liver disease (like autoim-\\nmune hepatitis and cirrhosis ), and in certain tropical dis-\\neases (for example, leprosy ). Very low total protein lev-\\nels (less than 4.0 g/dl) and low albumin cause the edema(water retention) usually seen in nephrotic syndromes.Decreased protein levels may be seen in pregnancy,chronic alcoholism , prolonged immobilization ,heart\\nfailure ,starvation , and malabsorption or malnutrition .\\nIncreased albumin levels are found in dehydration.\\nDecreased albumin levels are indicative of liver disease,protein-losing syndromes, malnutrition, inflammatorydisease, and familial idiopathic (of unknown cause) dys-proteinemia, a genetic disease in which the albumin is\\nsignificantly reduced and globulins increased.\\nIncreased globulin levels are found in multiple myelo-\\nmaand Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, two cancers\\ncharacterized by overproduction of gammaglobulin fromproliferating plasma cells. Increased globulin levels arealso found in chronic inflammatory diseases such asrheumatoid arthritis , acute and chronic infection, and cir-\\nrhosis. Decreased globulin levels are seen in geneticimmune disorders and secondary immune deficiency.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCahill, Mathew. Handbook of Diagnostic Tests.

The admin-istration of a contrast dye used in some other tests mayfalsely elevate protein levels. Drugs that can alter resultsinclude aspirin , bicarbonates, chlorpromazine (Tho-\\nrazine), corticosteroids , isoniazid (INH), and neomycin\\n(Mycifradin).\\nDescription\\nProteins are major components of muscle, enzymes,\\nhormones, hemoglobin, and other body tissues. Proteinsare composed of elements that can be separated from oneanother by several different techniques: chemical meth-ods, ultracentrifuge, or electrophoresis. There are twomajor types of electrophoresis: protein electrophoresisand immunoelectrophoresis . Immunoelectrophoresis is\\nused to assess the blood levels of specific types of pro-teins called immunoglobulins. An immunoelectrophore-sis test is usually ordered if a SPEP test has a “spike,” orrise, at the immunoglobulin level. Protein electrophoresisis used to determine the total amount of protein in theblood, and to establish the levels of other types of pro-teins called albumin, alpha\\n1globulin, alpha2globulin, and\\nbeta-globulin.\\nBlood proteins\\nALBUMIN. Albumin is a protein that is made in the\\nliver. It helps to retain elements like calcium, some hor-mones, and certain drugs in the circulation by binding tothem to prevent their being filtered out by the kidneys.Albumin also acts to regulate the movement of waterbetween the tissues and the bloodstream by attracting waterto areas with higher concentrations of salts or proteins.\\nGLOBULINS. Globulins are another type of protein,\\nlarger in size than albumin. They are divided into threemain groups: alpha, beta, and gamma.\\n• Alphaglobulins. These proteins include alpha\\n1and\\nalpha2globulins. Alpha1globulin is predominantly\\nalpha1-antitrypsin, an enzyme produced by the lungs\\nand liver. Alpha2globulin, which includes serum hapto-\\nglobin, is a protein that binds hemoglobin to prevent itsexcretion by the kidneys. Various other alphaglobulinsare produced as a result of inflammation, tissue dam-age,autoimmune disorders , or certain cancers.\\n• Betaglobulins. These include low-density substances\\ninvolved in fat transport (lipoproteins), iron transport(transferrin), and blood clotting (plasminogen and com-\\nplement).\\n• Gammaglobulins. All of the gammaglobulins are anti-\\nbodies—proteins produced by the immune system inresponse to infection, allergic reactions, and organ trans-plants. If serum protein electrophoresis has demonstrat-ed a significant rise at the gammaglobulin level, immu-noelectrophoresis is done to identify the specific globu-lin that is involved.\\nElectrophoretic measurement of proteins\\nAll proteins have an electrical charge. The SPEP\\ntest is designed to make use of this characteristic. Thereis some difference in method, but basically the sampleis placed in or on a special medium (e.g., a gel), and anelectric current is applied to the gel. The protein parti-cles move through the gel according to the strength oftheir electrical charges, forming bands or zones. Aninstrument called a densitometer measures these bands,which can be identified and associated with specificdiseases. For example, a decrease in albumin with a risein the alpha\\n2globulin usually indicates an acute reac-\\ntion of the type that occurs in infections, burns ,stress ,\\nor heart attack . On the other hand, a slight decrease in\\nalbumin, with a slight increase in gammaglobulin , and\\na normal alpha2globulin is more indicative of a chronic\\ninflammatory condition, as might be seen in cirrhosis\\nof the liver.\\nProtein electrophoresis is performed on urine sam-\\nples to classify kidney disorders that cause protein loss.Here also certain band patterns are specific for disease.For example, the identification of a specific proteincalled the Bence Jones protein (by performing the Bence\\nJones protein test ) during the procedure suggests multi-\\nple myeloma .\\nPreparation\\nThe serum protein electrophoresis test requires a\\nblood sample. It is not necessary for the patient to restrictfood or fluids before the test. The urine protein elec-trophoresis test requires either an early morning urinesample or a 24-hour urine sample according to the physi-cian’s request. The doctor should check to see if thepatient is taking any medications that may affect testresults.\\nRisks\\nRisks posed by the blood test are minimal but may\\ninclude slight bleeding from the puncture site, fainting\\nor lightheadedness after the blood is drawn, or the devel-opment of a small bruise at the puncture site.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2745Protein electrophoresis'),\n",

It is the leading cause ofdeath in children in developing countries.\\nDescription\\nPEM is also referred to as protein-calorie malnutri-\\ntion. It develops in children and adults whose consump-tion of protein and energy (measured by calories) isinsufficient to satisfy the body’s nutritional needs. Whilepure protein deficiency can occur when a person’s dietprovides enough energy but lacks the protein minimum,in most cases the deficiency will be dual. PEM may alsooccur in persons who are unable to absorb vital nutrientsor convert them to energy essential for healthy tissue for-mation and organ function.\\nAlthough PEM is not prevalent among the general\\npopulation of the United States, it is often seen in elderlypeople who live in nursing homes and in children whoseparents are poor. PEM occurs in one of every two surgi-cal patients and in 48% of all other hospital patients.\\nTypes of PEM\\nPrimary PEM results from a diet that lacks sufficient\\nsources of protein and/or energy. Secondary PEM ismore common in the United States, where it usuallyoccurs as a complication of AIDS ,cancer ,chronic kid-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2746Protein-energy malnutritionKEY TERMS\\nAlbumin —A blood protein that is made in the\\nliver and helps to regulate water movement in thebody.\\nElectrophoresis —A technique for separating vari-\\nous blood fractions by running an electric currentthrough a gel containing a blood sample.\\nGlobulins —A group of proteins in blood plasma\\nwhose levels can be measured by electrophoresisin order to diagnose or monitor a variety of seriousillnesses.\\nHaptoglobin —A protein in blood plasma that\\nbinds hemoglobin.\\nImmunoglobulins —Any of several types of globu-\\nlin proteins that function as antibodies.'),\n",

PEM candevelop gradually in a patient who has a chronic illnessor experiences chronic semi-starvation. It may appearsuddenly in a patient who has an acute illness.\\nKwashiorkor\\nKwashiorkor, also called wet protein-energy malnu-\\ntrition, is a form of PEM characterized primarily by pro-tein deficiency. This condition usually appears at the ageof about 12 months when breastfeeding is discontinued,but it can develop at any time during a child’s formativeyears. It causes fluid retention ( edema ); dry, peeling\\nskin; and hair discoloration.\\nMarasmus\\nPrimarily caused by energy deficiency, marasmus is\\ncharacterized by stunted growth and wasting of muscleand tissue. Marasmus usually develops between the agesof six months and one year in children who have beenweaned from breast milk or who suffer from weakeningconditions like chronic diarrhea .\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSecondary PEM symptoms range from mild to\\nsevere, and can alter the form or function of almost everyorgan in the body. The type and intensity of symptomsdepend on the patient’s prior nutritional status and on thenature of the underlying disease and the speed at which itis progressing.\\nMild, moderate, and severe classifications have not\\nbeen precisely defined, but patients who lose 10–20% oftheir body weight without trying are usually said to havemoderate PEM. This condition is also characterized by aweakened grip and inability to perform high-energy tasks.\\nLosing 20% of body weight or more is generally\\nclassified as severe PEM. People with this conditioncan’t eat normal-sized meals. They have slow heart ratesand low blood pressure and body temperatures. Othersymptoms of severe secondary PEM include baggy,wrinkled skin; constipation ; dry, thin, brittle hair; lethar-\\ngy; pressure sores and other skin lesions .\\nKwashiorkor\\nPeople who have kwashiorkor often have extremely\\nthin arms and legs, but liver enlargement and ascites\\n(abnormal accumulation of fluid) can distend theabdomen and disguise weight loss. Hair may turn red oryellow. Anemia, diarrhea, and fluid and electrolyte dis-\\norders are common. The body’s immune system is often\\nweakened, behavioral development is slow, and mentalretardation may occur. Children may grow to normal\\nheight but are abnormally thin.\\nKwashiorkor-like secondary PEM usually develops\\nin patients who have been severely burned, suffered trau-ma, or had sepsis (tissue-destroying infection) or another\\nlife-threatening illness. The condition’s onset is so suddenthat body fat and muscle mass of normal-weight peoplemay not change. Some obese patients even gain weight.\\nMarasmus\\nProfound weakness accompanies severe marasmus.\\nSince the body breaks down its own tissue to use as calories,people with this condition lose all their body fat and musclestrength, and acquire a skeletal appearance most noticeablein the hands and in the temporal muscle in front of andabove each ear. Children with marasmus are small for theirage. Since their immune systems are weakened, they sufferfrom frequent infections. Other symptoms include loss ofappetite, diarrhea, skin that is dry and baggy, sparse hair thatis dull brown or reddish yellow, mental retardation, behav-ioral retardation, low body temperature ( hypothermia ), and\\nslow pulse and breathing rates.\\nThe absence of edema distinguishes marasmus-like\\nsecondary PEM, a gradual wasting process that beginswith weight loss and progresses to mild, moderate, orsevere malnutrition (cachexia). It is usually associatedwith cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD), or another chronic disease that is inactive orprogressing very slowly.\\nSome individuals have both kwashiorkor and maras-\\nmus at the same time. This most often occurs when a per-son who has a chronic, inactive condition developssymptoms of an acute illness.\\nHospitalized patients\\nDifficulty chewing, swallowing, and digesting food,\\npain, nausea, and lack of appetite are among the most com-\\nmon reasons that many hospital patients don’t consumeenough nutrients. Nutrient loss can be accelerated bybleeding, diarrhea, abnormally high sugar levels (glyco-suria), kidney disease, malabsorption disorders, and otherfactors. Fever , infection, surgery, and benign or malignant\\ntumors increase the amount of nutrients hospitalizedpatients need. So do trauma, burns , and some medications.\\nDiagnosis\\nA thorough physical examination and a health his-\\ntory that probes eating habits and weight changes, focuseson body-fat composition and muscle strength, and assess-es gastrointestinal symptoms, underlying illness, andnutritional status is often as accurate as blood tests andurinalyses used to detect and document abnormalities.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2747Protein-energy malnutrition'),\n",

Tube feeding or intravenousfeeding is used to supply nutrients to patients who can’tor won’t eat protein-rich foods.\\nIn patients with severe PEM, the first stage of treat-\\nment consists of correcting fluid and electrolyte imbal-ances, treating infection with antibiotics that don’t affect\\nprotein synthesis, and addressing related medical prob-lems. The second phase involves replenishing essentialnutrients slowly to prevent taxing the patient’s weakenedsystem with more food than it can handle. Physical thera-py may be beneficial to patients whose muscles havedeteriorated significantly.\\nPrognosis\\nMost people can lose up to 10% of their body weight\\nwithout side effects, but losing more than 40% is almostalways fatal. Death usually results from heart failure ,a n\\nelectrolyte imbalance, or low body temperature. Patientswith certain symptoms, including semiconsciousness,persistent diarrhea, jaundice , and low blood sodium lev-\\nels, have a poorer prognosis than other patients. Recov-ery from marasmus usually takes longer than recoveryfrom kwashiorkor. The long-term effects of childhoodmalnutrition are uncertain. Some children recover com-pletely, while others may have a variety of lifelongimpairments, including an inability to properly absorbnutrients in the intestines and mental retardation. Theoutcome appears to be related to the length and severityof the malnutrition, as well as to the age of the childwhen the malnutrition occurred.\\nPrevention\\nBreastfeeding a baby for at least six months is con-\\nsidered the best way to prevent early-childhood malnutri-tion. Preventing malnutrition in developing countries is acomplicated and challenging problem. Providing fooddirectly during famine can help in the short-term, butmore long-term solutions are needed, including agricul-tural development, public health programs (especiallyprograms that monitor growth and development, as wellas programs that provide nutritional information and sup-\\nplements), and improved food distribution systems. Pro-grams that distribute infant formula and discouragebreastfeeding should be discontinued, except in areaswhere many mothers are infected with HIV .\\nEvery patient being admitted to a hospital should be\\nscreened for the presence of illnesses and conditions thatcould lead to PEM. The nutritional status of patients athigher-than-average risk should be more thoroughlyassessed and periodically reevaluated during extendedhospital stays or nursing home residence.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBennett, J.

Fibrinogen is a type of\\nblood protein called a globulin; it is converted to fibrinduring the clotting process. A drop in the concentrationof any of these factors will cause the blood to take longerto clot. The PT test is used in combination with the par-\\ntial thromboplastin time (PTT) test to screen for hemo-\\nphilia and other hereditary clotting disorders.\\nMonitoring\\nThe PT test is also used to monitor the condition of\\npatients who are taking warfarin (Coumadin). Warfarin isa drug that is given to prevent clots in the deep veins ofthe legs and to treat pulmonary embolism . It interferes\\nwith blood clotting by lowering the liver’s production ofcertain clotting factors.\\nDescription\\nA sample of the patient’s blood is obtained by\\nvenipuncture. The blood is collected in a tube that con-tains sodium citrate to prevent the clotting process fromstarting before the test. The blood cells are separatedfrom the liquid part of blood (plasma). The PT test is per-formed by adding the patient’s plasma to a protein in theblood (thromboplastin) that converts prothrombin tothrombin. The mixture is then kept in a warm water bath\\nat 37°C for one to two minutes. Calcium chloride isadded to the mixture in order to counteract the sodiumcitrate and allow clotting to proceed. The test is timedfrom the addition of the calcium chloride until the plas-ma clots. This time is called the prothrombin time.\\nPreparation\\nThe doctor should check to see if the patient is taking\\nany medications that may affect test results. This precau-tion is particularly important if the patient is taking war-farin, because there are a number of medications that caninteract with warfarin to increase or decrease the PT time.\\nAftercare\\nAftercare consists of routine care of the area around\\nthe puncture mark.

Because itrarely causes disease in healthy persons, but infects thosewho are already sick or who have weakened immunesystems, it is called an opportunistic pathogen. Oppor-tunistic pathogens are organisms that do not ordinarilycause disease, but multiply freely in persons whoseimmune systems are weakened by illness or medication.Such persons are said to be immunocompromised.Patients with AIDS have an increased risk of developing\\nserious pseudomonas infections.

These\\ninfections may result from brain injury or surgery, thespread of infection from other parts of the body, or bac-teremia.\\n• Eye and ear. P . aeruginosa can cause infections in the\\nexternal ear canal—so-called “swimmer’s ear”— thatusually disappear without treatment. The bacterium cancause a more serious ear infection in elderly patients,possibly leading to hearing problems, facial paralysis ,\\nor even death . Pseudomonas infections of the eye usu-\\nally follow an injury. They can cause ulcers of thecornea that may cause rapid tissue destruction andeventual blindness.

Consequently, the mere presence of P.\\naeruginosa in patients does not constitute a diagnostic\\nfinding. Cultures, however, can be easily done for testpurposes. The organism grows readily in laboratorymedia; results are usually available in two to three days.Depending on the location of the infection, body fluidsthat can be tested for P . aeruginosa include blood, urine,\\ncerebrospinal fluid, sputum, pus, and drainage from aninfected ear or eye. X rays and other imaging techniquescan be used to assess infections in deep organ tissues.\\nTreatment\\nMedications\\nBecause P . aeruginosa is commonly resistant to\\nantibiotics, infections are usually treated with two antibi-otics at once. Pseudomonas infections may be treatedwith combinations of ceftazidime (Ceftaz, Fortraz, Taz-icef), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), imipenem (Primaxin), gen-tamicin (Garamycin), tobramycin (Nebcin), ticarcillin-clavulanate (Timentin), or piperacillin-tazobactam(Zosyn). Most antibiotics are administered intravenouslyor orally for two to six weeks. Treatment of an eye infec-tion requires local application of antibiotic drops.\\nSurgery\\nSurgical treatment of pseudomonas infections is\\nsometimes necessary to remove infected and damagedtissue. Surgery may be required for brain abscesses, eyeinfections, bone and joint infections, ear infections, heartinfections, and wound infections.

PXE is also known asGrönblad-Strandberg-Touraine syndrome and systemicelastorrhexis.\\nThe course of PXE varies greatly between individu-\\nals. Typically it is first noticed during adolescence as yel-low-orange bumps on the side of the neck. Similarbumps may appear at other places where the skin bends alot, like the backs of the knees and the insides of theelbows. The skin in these areas tends to get thick, leath-ery, inelastic, and acquire extra folds. These skin prob-lems have no serious consequences, and for some people,the disease progresses no further.\\nBruch’s membrane, a layer of elastic fibers in front\\nof the retina, becomes calcified in some people withPXE. Calcification causes cracks in Bruch’s membrane,which can be seen through an ophthalmoscope as red,brown, or gray streaks called angioid streaks. The crackscan eventually (e.g., in 10–20 years) cause bleeding, andthe usual resultant scarring leads to central vision deteri-oration. However, peripheral vision is unaffected.\\nArterial walls and heart valves contain elastic fibers\\nthat can become calcified. This leads to a greater suscepti-bility to the conditions that are associated with hardeningof the arteries in the normal aging population—high\\nblood pressure, heart attack ,stroke , and arterial obstruc-\\ntion—and, similarly, mitral valve prolapse . Heart dis-\\nease and hypertension associated with PXE have been\\nreported in children as young as four to 13 years of age.Although often appearing at a younger age, the overallincidence of these conditions is only slightly higher forpeople with PXE than it is in the general population.\\nArterial inelasticity can lead to bleeding from the\\ngastrointestinal tract and, rarely, acute vomiting of blood.\\nPXE is rare and occurs in about 1 in every 160,000\\npeople in the general population. It is likely, though,that PXE is underdiagnosed, because of the presence ofmild symptoms in some affected persons and the lackof awareness of the condition among primary carephysicians.Causes and symptoms\\nPXE is caused by changes in the genetic material,\\ncalled mutations, that are inherited in either a dominantor recessive mode. A person with the recessive form ofthe disease (which is most common) must possess twocopies of the PXE gene to be affected, and, therefore,must have received one from each parent. In the domi-nant form, one copy of the defective gene is sufficient tocause the disease. In some cases, a person with the domi-nant form inherits the abnormal gene from a parent withPXE. More commonly, the mutation arises as a sponta-neous change in the genetic material of the affected per-son. These cases are called “sporadic” and do not affectparents or siblings, although each child of a person withsporadic PXE has a 50% risk to inherit the condition.\\nBoth males and females develop PXE, although the\\nskin findings seem to be somewhat more common infemales.\\nThe actual genetic causes of this condition were not\\ndiscovered until 2000. The recessive, dominant, and spo-radic forms of PXE all appear to be caused by differentmutations or deletions in a single gene called ABCC6(also known as MRP6), located on chromosome 16.Although the responsible gene has been identified, how itcauses PXE is still unknown.\\nGenetic researchers have since identified mutations\\nin a number of persons with PXE, most of whom havebeen found to have the recessive type. Affected individu-als in these families had mutations in both copies of thegene and parents, who are obligate carriers, had a muta-tion in only one copy. Contrary to the usual lack ofsymptoms in carriers of recessive genes, some carriers ofrecessive PXE have been found to have cardiovascularsymptoms typical of PXE.\\nAlthough the recessive type is the most common,\\nthere are also familial and sporadic cases that have beenfound to be caused by dominant mutations in the ABCC6gene.\\nA wide range in the type and severity of symptoms\\nexists between people with PXE. The age of onset alsovaries, although most people notice initial symptoms dur-ing adolescence or early adulthood. Often, the first symp-toms to appear are thickened skin with yellow bumps inlocalized areas such as the folds of the groin, arms, knees,and armpits. These changes can also occur in the mucousmembranes, most often in the inner portion of the lowerlip. The appearance of the skin in PXE has been likenedto a plucked chicken or Moroccan leather.\\nAngioid streaks in front of the retina are present in\\nmost people with PXE and an ophthalmologic examinationcan be used as an initial screen for the condition.

Pettersen\\nPsittacosis seeParrot fever\\nPsoas abscess seeAbscessPsoriasis\\nDefinition\\nNamed for the Greek word pso¯ra meaning “itch,”\\npsoriasis is a chronic, non-contagious disease character-ized by inflamed lesions covered with silvery-whitescabs of dead skin.\\nDescription\\nPsoriasis, which affects at least four million Ameri-\\ncans, is slightly more common in women than in men.Although the disease can develop at any time, 10–15% ofall cases are diagnosed in children under 10, and theaverage age at the onset of symptoms is 28. Psoriasis ismost common in fair-skinned people and extremely rarein dark-skinned individuals.\\nNormal skin cells mature and replace dead skin\\nevery 28–30 days. Psoriasis causes skin cells to mature inless than a week. Because the body can’t shed old skin asrapidly as new cells are rising to the surface, raisedpatches of dead skin develop on the arms, back, chest,elbows, legs, nails, folds between the buttocks, and scalp.\\nPsoriasis is considered mild if it affects less than 5%\\nof the surface of the body; moderate, if 5–30% of theskin is involved, and severe, if the disease affects morethan 30% of the body surface.\\nTypes of psoriasis\\nDermatologists distinguish different forms of psoria-\\nsis according to what part of the body is affected, howsevere symptoms are, how long they last, and the patternformed by the scales.\\nPLAQUE PSORIASIS. Plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vul-\\ngaris), the most common form of the disease, is charac-terized by small, red bumps that enlarge, becomeinflamed, and form scales. The top scales flake off easilyand often, but those beneath the surface of the skin clumptogether. Removing these scales exposes tender skin,which bleeds and causes the plaques (inflamed patches)to grow.\\nPlaque psoriasis can develop on any part of the body,\\nbut most often occurs on the elbows, knees, scalp, andtrunk.\\nSCALP PSORIASIS. At least 50 of every 100 people\\nwho have any form of psoriasis have scalp psoriasis. Thisform of the disease is characterized by scale-cappedplaques on the surface of the skull.\\nNAIL PSORIASIS. The first sign of nail psoriasis is\\nusually pitting of the fingernails or toenails. Size, shape,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2755Psoriasis'),\n",

The skin around an affectednail is sometimes inflamed, and the nail may peel awayfrom the nail bed.\\nGUTTATE PSORIASIS. Named for the Latin word\\ngutta, which means “a drop,” guttate psoriasis is charac-\\nterized by small, red, drop-like dots that enlarge rapidlyand may be somewhat scaly. Often found on the arms,legs, and trunk and sometimes in the scalp, guttate psori-asis can clear up without treatment or disappear andresurface in the form of plaque psoriasis.\\nPUSTULAR PSORIASIS. Pustular psoriasis usually\\noccurs in adults. It is characterized by blister-like lesionsfilled with non-infectious pus and surrounded by red-dened skin. Pustular psoriasis, which can be limited toone part of the body (localized) or can be widespread,may be the first symptom of psoriasis or develop in apatient with chronic plaque psoriasis.\\nGeneralized pustular psoriasis is also known as V on\\nZumbusch pustular psoriasis. Widespread, acutely painfulpatches of inflamed skin develop suddenly. Pustules appearwithin a few hours, then dry and peel within two days.\\nGeneralized pustular psoriasis can make life-threat-\\nening demands on the heart and kidneys.\\nPalomar-plantar pustulosis (PPP) generally appears\\nbetween the ages of 20 and 60. PPP causes large pustulesto form at the base of the thumb or on the sides of the heel.In time, the pustules turn brown and peel. The disease usu-ally becomes much less active for a while after peeling.\\nAcrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau is a form of\\nPPP characterized by painful, often disabling, lesions onthe fingertips or the tips of the toes. The nails maybecome deformed, and the disease can damage bone inthe affected area.\\nINVERSE PSORIASIS. Inverse psoriasis occurs in the\\narmpits and groin, under the breasts, and in other areaswhere skin flexes or folds. This disease is characterizedby smooth, inflamed lesions and can be debilitating.\\nERYTHRODERMIC PSORIASIS. Characterized by\\nsevere scaling, itching , and pain that affects most of the\\nbody, erythrodermic psoriasis disrupts the body’s chemi-cal balance and can cause severe illness. This particularlyinflammatory form of psoriasis can be the first sign ofthe disease, but often develops in patients with a historyof plaque psoriasis.\\nPSORIATIC ARTHRITIS. About 10% of partients with\\npsoriasis develop a complication called psoriatic arthri-\\ntis. This type of arthritis can be slow to develop and mild,\\nor it can develop rapidly. Symptoms of psoriatic arthritisinclude:• joint discomfort, swelling, stiffness, or throbbing\\n• swelling in the toes and ankles• pain in the digits, lower back, wrists, knees, and ankles• eye inflammation or pink eye (conjunctivitis).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of psoriasis is unknown, but research sug-\\ngests that an immune-system malfunction triggers thedisease. Factors that increase the risk of developing pso-riasis include:\\n• family history\\n• stress• exposure to cold temperatures• injury, illness, or infection• steroids and other medications• race\\nTrauma and certain bacteria may trigger psoriatic\\narthritis in patients with psoriasis.\\nDiagnosis\\nA complete medical history and examination of the\\nskin, nails, and scalp are the basis for a diagnosis of pso-riasis. In some cases, a microscopic examination of skincells is also performed.\\nBlood tests can distinguish psoriatic arthritis from\\nother types of arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis , in partic-\\nular, is diagnosed by the presence of a particular anti-body present in the blood. That antibody is not present inthe blood of patients with psoriatic arthritis.\\nTreatment\\nAge, general health, lifestyle, and the severity and\\nlocation of symptoms influence the type of treatmentused to reduce inflammation and decrease the rate atwhich new skin cells are produced. Because the course ofthis disease varies with each individual, doctors mustexperiment with or combine different treatments to findthe most effective therapy for a particular patient.\\nMild-moderate psoriasis\\nSteroid creams and ointments are commonly used to\\ntreat mild or moderate psoriasis, and steroids are some-times injected into the skin of patients with a limitednumber of lesions. In mid-1997, the United States Foodand Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use oftazarotene (Tazorac) to treat mild-to-moderate plaquepsoriasis. This water-based gel has chemical propertiessimilar to vitamin A.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2756Psoriasis'),\n",

Psoriasis patients who par-ticipate in these intensive sessions are exposed to UVBand given other treatments for six to eight hours a day fortwo to four weeks.\\nSevere psoriasis\\nMethotrexate (MTX) can be given as a pill or as an\\ninjection to alleviate symptoms of severe psoriasis orpsoriatic arthritis. Patients who take MTX must be care-fully monitored to prevent liver damage.\\nPsoriatic arthritis can also be treated with non-\\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), like\\nacetaminophen (Tylenol) or aspirin. Hot compresses\\nand warm water soaks may also provide some relief forpainful joints.\\nOther medications used to treat severe psoriasis\\ninclude etrentinate (Tegison) and isotretinoin (Accutane),whose chemical properties are similar to those of vitaminA.

In some patients, the arthritic symptomswill affect the small joints at the ends of the fingers andtoes. In others, symptoms will affect joints on one side ofthe body but not on the other. In addition, there are patientswhose larger joints on both sides of the body simultane-ously become affected, as in rheumatoid arthritis . Some\\npeople with psoriatic arthritis experience arthritis symp-toms in the back and spine; in rare cases, called psoriaticarthritis mutilans, the disease destroys the joints andbones, leaving patients with gnarled and club-like handsand feet. In many patients, symptoms of psoriasis precedethe arthritis symptoms; a clue to possible joint disease ispitting and other changes in the fingernails.\\nMost people develop psoriatic arthritis at ages 35–45,\\nbut it has been observed earlier in adults and children.Both the skin and joint symptoms will come and go; thereis no clear relationship between the severity of the psoria-sis symptoms and arthritis pain at any given time. It is\\nunclear how common psoriatic arthritis is. Recent surveys\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2758Psoriatic arthritis'),\n",

As in\\npsoriasis, genetic factors appear to be involved. Peoplewith psoriatic arthritis are more likely than others to haveclose relatives with the disease, but they are just as likelyto have relatives with psoriasis but no joint disease.Researchers believe genes increasing the susceptibility todeveloping psoriasis may be located on chromosome 6pand chromosome 17, but the specific genetic abnormalityhas not been identified. Like psoriasis and other forms ofarthritis, psoriatic arthritis also appears to be an autoim-mune disorder, triggered by an attack of the body’s ownimmune system on itself.\\nSymptoms of psoriatic arthritis include dry, scaly,\\nsilver patches of skin combined with joint pain anddestructive changes in the feet, hands, knees, and spine.Tendon pain and nail deformities are other hallmarks ofpsoriatic arthritis.\\nDiagnosis\\nSkin and nail changes characteristic of psoriasis\\nwith accompanying arthritic symptoms are the hallmarksof psoriatic arthritis. A blood test for rheumatoid factor,antibodies that suggest the presence of rheumatoid arthri-tis, is negative in nearly all patients with psoriatic arthri-tis. X rays may show characteristic damage to the largerjoints on either side of the body as well as fusion of thejoints at the ends of the fingers and toes.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for psoriatic arthritis is meant to control\\nthe skin lesions of psoriasis and the joint inflammation\\nof arthritis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ,\\ngold salts, and sulfasalazine are standard arthritis treat-ments, but have no effect on psoriasis. Antimalaria drugsand systemic corticosteroids should be avoided because\\nthey can cause dermatitis or exacerbate psoriasis when\\nthey are discontinued.\\nSeveral treatments are useful for both the skin lesions\\nand the joint inflammation of psoriatic arthritis. Etretinate,a vitamin A derivative; methotrexate, a potent suppressr ofthe immune system; and ultraviolet light therapy have allbeen successfully used to treat psoriatic arthritis.\\nAlternative treatment\\nFood allergies/intolerances are believed to play a\\nrole in most autoimmune disorders , including psoriaticKEY TERMS\\nPsoriasis —A common recurring skin disease that\\nis marked by dry, scaly, and silvery patches of skinthat appear in a variety of sizes and locations onthe body.\\nPsoriatic arthritis mutilans —A severe form of pso-\\nriatic arthritis that destroys the joints of the fingersand toes and causes the bones to fuse, leavingpatients with gnarled and club-like hands and feet.\\nRheumatoid arthritis —A systemic disease that pri-\\nmarily affects the joints, causing inflammation,changes in structure, and loss of function.\\nRheumatoid factor —A series of antibodies that\\nsignal the presence of rheumatoid arthritis.

The primarypurpose for such intervention is typically an urgent oremergent condition that could cause danger to the affect-ed person or others, or cause severe disability to theextent whereby the affected person is unable to care forhimself or herself.\\nPrecautions\\nClinicians utilizing this form of patient and public\\nsafety should perform a comprehensive mental status\\nexamination and document the findings. This approach\\ncan potentially provide clear records establishing thespecific presenting problems and symptoms that can leadto ambiguities and potential legal action.\\nDescription\\nConfinement with restraints can be categorized as\\nurgent or emergent. Emergent causes can includepatients exhibiting abnormal vital signs (breathing, pulserate, temperature, blood pressure), threatening or violentbehavior, and those who present with signs and symp-toms of alcohol or illicit drug intoxication. Urgent use ofconfinement is indicated in patients showing suicidalthoughts, extreme anxiety , homicidal or violent tenden-\\ncies, or a danger to self or the public at large.Preparation\\nThose categorized as emergent should be prepared\\nfor further testing that can include blood chemistry andpsychological assessment and evaluation. Initially thepatient is restrained with four point leather restraints(both arms and both legs) and placed in a quiet room witha sitter. For those with urgent needs, restraint is initiatedand initial management is directed to assess for an under-lying medical cause and address psychological needs.\\nAftercare\\nFurther assessment, testing, and evaluation is neces-\\nsary for a definitive diagnosis and devising an appropri-ate treatment plan.\\nRisks\\nA deficiency in record-keeping can lead to legal\\nproblems. The criteria and specifications for confinementshould be clearly indicated. Meticulous clinical examina-tion and documentation is essential for a definitive diag-nosis. Persons who are confined due to substance abuseproblems may have legal issues. As of 2001 there is pro-posed legislation concerning the misuse of restraints forpsychiatric inpatients, which in the past has been respon-sible for numerous wrongful deaths. There are currentlyno federal laws that regulate the use of inpatient restraintsnor any requirements for reporting injuries or death .\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nRosen, Peter.

Psychoanalysis is done one-on-one with the patient and the analyst; it is not appropriatefor group work.\\nPurpose\\nPsychoanalysis is the most intensive form of an\\napproach to treatment called psychodynamic therapy.Psychodynamic refers to a view of human personalitythat results from interactions between conscious andunconscious factors. The purpose of all forms of psycho-dynamic treatment is to bring unconscious mental mater-ial and processes into full consciousness so that thepatient can gain more control over his or her life.\\nClassical psychoanalysis has become the least com-\\nmonly practiced form of psychodynamic therapy becauseof its demands on the patient’s time, as well as on his orher emotional and financial resources. It is, however, theoldest form of psychodynamic treatment. The theories thatunderlie psychoanalysis were worked out by SigmundFreud (1856–1939), a Viennese physician, during the earlyyears of the twentieth century. Freud’s discoveries weremade in the context of his research into hypnosis. The goalof psychoanalysis is the uncovering and resolution of thepatient’s internal conflicts. The treatment focuses on theformation of an intense relationship between the therapistand patient, which is analyzed and discussed in order todeepen the patient’s insight into his or her problems.\\nPsychoanalytic psychotherapy is a modified form of\\npsychoanalysis that is much more widely practiced. It isbased on the same theoretical principles as psychoanaly-sis, but is less intense and less concerned with majorchanges in the patient’s character structure. The focus intreatment is usually the patient’s current life situation andthe way problems relate to early conflicts and feelings,rather than an exploration of the unconscious aspects ofthe relationship that has been formed with the therapist.\\nNot all patients benefit from psychoanalytic treat-\\nment. Potential patients should meet the following pre-requisites:\\n• The capacity to relate well enough to form an effective\\nworking relationship with the analyst. This relationshipis called a therapeutic alliance.\\n• At least average intelligence and a basic understanding\\nof psychological theory.\\n• The ability to tolerate frustration, sadness, and other\\npainful emotions.\\n• The capacity to distinguish between reality and fantasy.\\nPeople considered best suited to psychoanalytic\\ntreatment include those with depression, character disor-ders, neurotic conflicts, and chronic relationship prob-\\nlems. When the patient’s conflicts are long-standing anddeeply entrenched in his or her personality, psychoanaly-sis may be preferable to psychoanalytic psychotherapy,because of its greater depth.\\nPrecautions\\nPsychoanalysis is not suitable for patients suffering\\nfrom severe depression or psychotic disorders such asschizophrenia . It is also not appropriate for people with\\naddictions or substance dependency, disorders of aggres-sion or impulse control, or acute crises; some of thesepeople may benefit from psychoanalysis after the crisishas been resolved.\\nDescription\\nIn both psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic psy-\\nchotherapy, the therapist does not tell the patient how tosolve problems or offer moral judgments. The focus oftreatment is exploration of the patient’s mind and habitu-al thought patterns. Such therapy is termed “non-direct-ed.” It is also “insight-oriented,” meaning that the goal oftreatment is increased understanding of the sources ofone’s inner conflicts and emotional problems. The basictechniques of psychoanalytical treatment include:\\nTherapist neutrality\\nNeutrality means that the analyst does not take sides\\nin the patient’s conflicts, express feelings about thepatient, or talk about his or her own life. Therapist neu-trality is intended to help the patient stay focused onissues rather than be concerned with the therapist’s reac-tions. In psychoanalysis, the patient lies on a couch fac-ing away from the therapist. In psychodynamic psy-chotherapy, however, the patient and therapist usually sitin comfortable chairs facing each other.\\nFree association\\nFree association means that the patient talks about\\nwhatever comes into mind without censoring or editingthe flow of ideas or memories. Free association allowsthe patient to return to earlier or more childlike emotion-al states (“regress”). Regression is sometimes necessaryin the formation of the therapeutic alliance. It also helpsthe analyst to understand the recurrent patterns of con-flict in the patient’s life.\\nTherapeutic alliance and transference\\nTransference is the name that psychoanalysts use for\\nthe patient’s repetition of childlike ways of relating thatwere learned in early life. If the therapeutic alliance hasbeen well established, the patient will begin to transfer\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2761Psychoanalysis'),\n",

Discussing thetransference helps the patient gain insight into the waysin which he or she misreads or misperceives other peoplein present life.\\nInterpretation\\nIn psychoanalytic treatment, the analyst is silent as\\nmuch as possible, in order to encourage the patient’s freeassociation. However, the analyst offers judiciouslytimed interpretations, in the form of verbal commentsabout the material that emerges in the sessions. The ther-apist uses interpretations in order to uncover the patient’sresistance to treatment, to discuss the patient’s transfer-ence feelings, or to confront the patient with inconsisten-cies. Interpretations may be either focused on presentissues ( “dynamic”) or intended to draw connectionsbetween the patient’s past and the present (“genetic”).The patient is also often encouraged to describe dreamsand fantasies as sources of material for interpretation.\\nWorking through\\n“Working through” occupies most of the work in\\npsychoanalytic treatment after the transference has beenformed and the patient has begun to acquire insights intohis or her problems. Working through is a process inwhich the new awareness is repeatedly tested and “triedon for size” in other areas of the patient’s life. It allowsthe patient to understand the influence of the past on hisor her present situation, to accept it emotionally as wellas intellectually, and to use the new understanding tomake changes in present life. Working through thus helpsthe patient to gain some measure of control over innerconflicts and to resolve them or minimize their power.\\nAlthough psychoanalytic treatment is primarily ver-\\nbal, medications are sometimes used to stabilize patientswith severe anxiety , depression, or other mood disor-\\nders during the analysis.\\nThe cost of either psychoanalysis or psychoanalytic\\npsychotherapy is prohibitive for most patients withoutinsurance coverage. A full course of psychoanalysis usu-ally requires three to five weekly sessions with a psycho-analyst over a period of three to five years. A course ofpsychoanalytic psychotherapy involves one to threemeetings per week with the therapist for two to fiveyears. Each session or meeting typically costs between$80 and $200, depending on the locale and the experi-ence of the therapist. The increasing reluctance of mostHMOs and other managed care organizations to pay forlong-term psychotherapy is one reason that these formsof treatment are losing ground to short-term methods oftreatment and the use of medications to control thepatient’s emotions.

Intelligence testingmay be used with adults to determine vocational ability(e.g., in career counseling) or to assess adult intellectualability in the classroom.\\nPersonality tests\\nPersonality tests are administered for a wide variety\\nof reasons, from diagnosing psychopathology (e.g., per-sonality disorder, depressive disorder) to screening jobcandidates. They may be used in an educational or voca-tional setting to determine personality strengths andweaknesses, or in the legal system to evaluate parolees.\\nNeuropsychological tests\\nPatients who have experienced a traumatic brain\\ninjury, brain damage, or organic neurological problems(for example, dementia ) are administered neuropsycho-\\nlogical tests to assess their level of functioning and iden-tify areas of mental impairment. They may also be usedto evaluate the progress of a patient who has undergonetreatment or rehabilitation for a neurological injury or\\nillness. In addition, certain neuropsychological measuresmay be used to screen children for developmental delaysand/or learning disabilities.\\nPrecautions\\nPsychological testing requires a clinically trained\\nexaminer. All psychological tests should be adminis-tered, scored, and interpreted by a trained professional,preferably a psychologist or psychiatrist with expertise inthe appropriate area.\\nPsychological tests are only one element of a psy-\\nchological assessment.

The test administrator should be informed\\nbefore psychological testing begins if the test taker is notfluent in English and/or belongs to a minority culture. Inaddition, the subject’s motivation and motives may alsoaffect test results.\\nDescription\\nPsychological tests are formalized measures of men-\\ntal functioning. Most are objective and quantifiable;however, certain projective tests may involve some levelof subjective interpretation. Also known as inventories,measurements, questionnaires, and scales, psychologicaltests are administered in a variety of settings, includingpreschools, primary and secondary schools, colleges anduniversities, hospitals, outpatient healthcare settings,social agencies, prisons, and employment or humanresource offices. They come in a variety of formats,including written, verbal, and computer administered.\\nAchievement and ability tests\\nAchievement and ability tests are designed to mea-\\nsure the level of an individual’s intellectual functioningand cognitive ability. Most achievement and ability testsare standardized, meaning that norms were establishedduring the design phase of the test by administering thetest to a large representative sample of the test popula-tion. Achievement and ability tests follow a uniform test-ing protocol, or procedure (i.e., test instructions, test con-ditions, and scoring procedures) and their scores can beinterpreted in relation to established norms. Commonachievement and ability tests include the Wechsler intel-\\nligence test (WISC-III and W AIS) and the Stanford-\\nBinet intelligence scales .\\nPersonality tests\\nPersonality tests and inventories evaluate the thoughts,\\nemotions, attitudes, and behavioral traits that comprise per-sonality. The results of these tests determine an individual’spersonality strengths and weaknesses, and may identifycertain disturbances in personality, or psychopathology.Tests such as the Minnesota multiphasic personality\\ninventory (MMPI-2 ) and the Millon clinical multiaxial\\ninventory III (MCMI-III), are used to screen individuals forspecific psychopathologies or emotional problems.\\nAnother type of personality test is the projective per-\\nsonality assessment. A projective test asks a subject tointerpret some ambiguous stimuli, such as a series ofinkblots. The subject’s responses provide insight into hisor her thought processes and personality traits. For exam-ple, the Rorschach inkblot test and the Holtzman ink\\nblot test (HIT) use a series of inkblots that the test sub-\\nject is asked to identify. Another projective assessment,the Thematic apperception test (TAT), asks the subject\\nto tell a story about a series of pictures. Some considerprojective tests to be less reliable than objective person-ality tests. If the examiner is not well-trained in psycho-metric evaluation, subjective interpretations may affectthe evaluation of these tests.\\nNeuropsychological tests\\nMany insurance plans cover all or a portion of diag-\\nnostic neuropsychological or psychological testing. As of1997, Medicare reimbursed for psychological and neu-ropsychological testing. Billing time typically includes testadministration, scoring and interpretation, and reporting.\\nPreparation\\nPrior to the administration of any psychological test,\\nthe administrator should provide the test subject withinformation on the nature of the test and its intended use,complete standardized instructions for taking the test(including any time limits and penalties for incorrectresponses), and information on the confidentiality of theresults. After these disclosures are made, informed con-sent should be obtained from the test subject before test-ing begins (except in cases of legally mandated testing,where consent is not required of the subject).\\nNormal results\\nAll psychological and neuropsychological assess-\\nments should be administered, scored, and interpreted bya trained professional. When interpreting test results fortest subjects, the test administrator will review with sub-jects: what the test evaluates, its precision in evaluation,any margins of error involved in scoring, and what theindividual scores mean in the context of overall testnorms and the background of the test subject.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nThe American Psychological Association.

They experience hallucinations and/or delu-\\nsions that they believe are real, and may behave and\\ncommunicate in an inappropriate and incoherent fashion.KEY TERMS\\nNorms —A fixed or ideal standard; normative or\\nmean score for a particular age group.\\nPsychopathology —A mental disorder or illness,\\nsuch as schizophrenia, personality disorder, ormajor depressive disorder.\\nQuantifiable —Can be expressed as a number. The\\nresults of quantifiable psychological tests can betranslated into numerical values, or scores.\\nRepresentative sample —A random sample of peo-\\nple that adequately represent the test taking popu-lation in age, gender, race, and socioeconomicstanding.\\nStandardization —The process of determining\\nestablished norms and procedures for a test to actas a standard reference point for future test results.Psychosis may appear as a symptom of a number of\\nmental disorders, including mood and personality dis-\\norders . It is also the defining feature of schizophrenia ,\\nschizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder ,\\ndelusional disorder, and the psyc hotic disorders  (i.e.,\\nbrief psychotic disorder, shared psychotic disorder, psy-chotic disorder due to a general medical condition, andsubstance-induced psychotic disorder).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPsychosis may be caused by the interaction of bio-\\nlogical and psychosocial factors depending on the disor-der in which it presents; psychosis can also be caused bypurely social factors, with no biological component.\\nSchizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, and\\nschizoaffective disorder\\nPsychosis in schizophrenia and perhaps schizo-\\nphreniform disorder appears to be related to abnormali-ties in the structure and chemistry of the brain, andappears to have strong genetic links; but its course andseverity can be altered by social factors such as stress or\\na lack of support within the family. The cause ofschizoaffective disorder is less clear cut, but biologicalfactors are also suspected.\\nDelusional disorder\\nThe exact cause of delusional disorder has not been\\nconclusively determined, but potential causes includeheredity, neurological abnormalities, and changes inbrain chemistry. Some studies have indicated that delu-sions are generated by abnormalities in the limbic sys-tem, the portion of the brain on the inner edge of thecerebral cortex that is believed to regulate emotions.\\nBrief psychotic disorder\\nTrauma and stress can cause a short-term psychosis\\n(less than a month’s duration) known as brief psychoticdisorder.

So-calledrecreational drugs, such as hallucinogenics, PCP, am-phetamines, cocaine ,marijuana , and alcohol, may\\ncause a psychotic reaction during use or withdrawal. Cer-tain prescription medications such as steroids, anticon-vulsants, chemotherapeutic agents, and antiparkinsonianmedications may also induce psychotic symptoms. Toxicsubstances such as carbon monoxide have also beenreported to cause substance-induced psychotic disorder.\\nPsychosis is characterized by the following symptoms:\\n• Delusions. Those delusions that occur in schizophrenia\\nand its related forms are typically bizarre (i.e., theycould not occur in real life). Delusions occurring indelusional disorder are more plausible, but still patentlyuntrue. In some cases, delusions may be accompaniedby feelings of paranoia .\\n• Hallucinations. Psychotic patients see, hear, smell,\\ntaste, or feel things that aren’t there. Schizophrenic hal-lucinations are typically auditory or, less commonly,visual; but psychotic hallucinations can involve any ofthe five senses.\\n• Disorganized speech. Psychotic patients, especially\\nthose with schizophrenia, often ramble on in incoher-ent, nonsensical speech patterns.\\n• Disorganized or catatonic behavior. The catatonic\\npatient reacts inappropriately to his or her environmentby either remaining rigid and immobile or by engagingin excessive motor activity. Disorganized behavior isbehavior or activity that is inappropriate for the situa-tion, or unpredictable.\\nDiagnosis\\nPatients with psychotic symptoms should undergo a\\nthorough physical examination and history to rule out\\npossible organic causes. If a psychiatric cause such asschizophrenia is suspected, a mental health professionalwill typically conduct an interview with the patient andadminister one of several clinical inventories, or tests, toevaluate mental status. This assessment takes place ineither an outpatient or hospital setting.\\nTreatment\\nPsychosis that is symptomatic of schizophrenia or\\nanother psychiatric disorder should be treated by a psy-chologist and/or psychiatrist. An appropriate course ofmedication and/or psychosocial therapy is employed totreat the underlying primary disorder. If the patient is\\nconsidered to be at risk for harming himself or others,inpatient treatment is usually recommended.\\nAntipsychotic medication such as thioridazine (Mel-\\nlaril), haloperidol (Haldol), chlorpromazine (Thorazine),clozapine (Clozaril), sertindole (Serlect), olanzapine(Zyprexa), or risperidone (Risperdal) is usually pre-scribed to bring psychotic symptoms under control andinto remission. Possible side effects of antipsychoticsinclude dry mouth , drowsiness, muscle stiffness, and\\ntardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements of the body).\\nAgranulocytosis, a potentially serious but reversiblehealth condition in which the white blood cells that fightinfection in the body are destroyed, is a possible sideeffect of clozapine. Patients treated with this drug shouldundergo weekly blood tests to monitor white blood cellcounts for the first six months, then every two weeks.\\nAfter an acute psychotic episode has subsided, anti-\\npsychotic drug maintenance treatment is typicallyemployed and psychosocial therapy and living and voca-tional skills training may be attempted.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis for brief psychotic disorder is quite good;\\nfor schizophrenia, less so. Generally, the longer andmore severe a psychotic episode, the poorer the progno-sis is for the patient. Early diagnosis and treatment arecritical to improving outcomes for the patient across allpsychotic disorders.\\nApproximately 10% of America’s permanently dis-\\nabled population is comprised of schizophrenic individu-als. The mortality rate of schizophrenic individuals arealso high—approximately 10% of schizophrenics com-mit suicide, and 20% attempt it. However, early diagno-sis and long-term follow up care can improve the outlookfor these patients considerably. Roughly 60% of patientswith schizophrenia will show substantial improvementwith appropriate treatment.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

In addition todisorder-specific symptoms, individuals with psychoso-cial dysfunction usually have difficulty functioning nor-\\nmally in social situations and may have trouble formingand maintaining close interpersonal relationships.\\nDiagnosis\\nPatients with symptoms of psychosocial disorders or\\nother mental illness should undergo a thorough physical\\nexamination and patient history to rule out an organic\\ncause for the illness (such as a neurological disorder). Ifno organic cause is suspected, a psychologist or othermental healthcare professional will meet with the patientto conduct an interview and take a detailed social andmedical history. If the patient is a minor, interviews witha parent or guardian may also be part of the diagnosticprocess. The physician may also administer one or morepsychological tests (also called clinical inventories,\\nscales, or assessments).\\nTreatment\\nCounseling is typically a front-line treatment for\\npsychosocial disorders. A number of counseling or talktherapy approaches exist, including psychotherapy, cog-nitive therapy, behavioral therapy, and group therapy .\\nTherapy or counseling may be administered by socialworkers, nurses, licensed counselors and therapists, psy-chologists, or psychiatrists.\\nPsychoactive medication may also be prescribed for\\nsymptom relief in patients with mental disorders consid-ered psychosocial in nature. For disorders such as majordepression or bipolar disorder , which may have psy-\\nchosocial aspects but also have known organic causes,drug therapy is a primary treatment approach. In casessuch as personality disorder that are thought to not havebiological roots, psychoactive medications are usuallyconsidered a secondary, or companion treatment to psy-chotherapy.\\nMany individuals are successful in treating psy-\\nchosocial disorders through regular attendance in self-help groups or 12-step programs such as AlcoholicsAnonymous. This approach, which allows individuals toseek advice and counsel from others in similar circum-stances, can be extremely effective.\\nIn some cases, treating mental illness requires hospi-\\ntalization of the patient. This hospitalization, also knownas inpatient treatment, is usually employed in situationswhere a controlled therapeutic environment is critical forthe patient’s recovery (e.g., rehabilitation treatment for\\nalcoholism or other drug addictions), or when there is a\\nrisk that the patient may harm himself (suicide) or others.It may also be necessary when the patient’s physicalhealth has deteriorated to a point where life-sustaining\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2768Psychosocial disorders'),\n",

The bilateral cingulotomy, a modern psy-chosurgical technique which has replaced the lobotomy,is performed to alleviate mental disorders such as majordepression, bipolar disorder , or obsessive-compulsive\\ndisorder (OCD), which have not responded to psy-\\nchotherapy, behavioral therapy, electroshock, or pharma-cologic treatment. Bilateral cingulotomies are also per-formed to treat chronic pain in cancer patients.\\nPrecautions\\nPsychosurgery should be considered only after all\\nother non-surgical psychiatric therapies have been fullyexplored. Much is still unknown about the biology of thebrain and how psychosurgery affects brain function.\\nDescription\\nPsychosurgery, and lobotomy in particular, reached\\nthe height of use just after World War II. Between 1946and 1949, the use of the lobotomy grew from 500 to5,000 annual procedures in the United States. At thattime, the procedure was viewed as a possible solution tothe overcrowded and understaffed conditions in state-runmental hospitals and asylums. Known as prefrontal ortransorbital lobotomy, depending on the surgical tech-nique used and area of the brain targeted, these earlyoperations were performed with surgical knives, elec-trodes, suction, or ice picks, to cut or sweep out portionsof the frontal lobe.\\nToday’s psychosurgical techniques are much more\\nrefined. Instead of going in “blind” to remove large sec-tions on the frontal lobe, as in these early operations,neurosurgeons use a computer-based process calledstereotactic magnetic resonance imaging to guide a\\nsmall electrode to the limbic system (brain structuresinvolved in autonomic or automatic body functions andsome emotion and behavior). There an electrical currentburns in a small lesion (usually 0.5 in (1.3 cm) in size).\\nIn a bilateral cingulotomy, the cingulate gyrus, a smallsection of brain that connects the limbic region of thebrain with the frontal lobes, is targeted. Another surgicaltechnique uses a non-invasive tool known as a gammaknife to focus beams of radiation at the brain. A lesionforms at the spot where the beams converge in the brain.Preparation\\nCandidates for cingulotomies or other forms of psy-\\nchosurgery undergo a rigorous screening process toensure that all possible non-surgical psychiatric treat-ment options have been explored. Psychosurgery is onlyperformed with the patient’s informed consent.\\nAftercare\\nOngoing behavioral and medication therapy is often\\nrequired in OCD patients who undergo cingulotomy. Allpsychosurgery patients should remain under a psychia-trist’s care for follow-up evaluations and treatment.\\nRisks\\nAs with any type of brain surgery, psychosurgery\\ncarries the risk of permanent brain damage, though theadvent of non-invasive neurosurgical techniques, such asthe gamma knife, has reduced the risk of brain damagesignificantly.\\nNormal results\\nIn a 1996 study at Massachusetts General Hospital,\\nover one-third of patients undergoing cingulotomydemonstrated significant improvements after the surgery.And, in contrast to the bizarre behavior and personalitychanges reported with lobotomy patients in the 1940sand 1950s, modern psychosurgery patients have demon-strated little post-surgical losses of memory or other highlevel thought processes.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nRodgers, Joann Ellison.

Pto-\\nsis, also called blepharoptosis, can affect one or both eyes.\\nDescription\\nThe eyelids serve to protect and lubricate the outer\\neye. The upper eyelid is lifted by a muscle called the lev-ator muscle. Inside the back part of the lid is a tarsal platewhich adds rigidity to the lid. The levator muscle isattached to the tarsal plate by a flat tendon called the lev-ator aponeurosis. When the muscle cannot lift the eyelidor lifts it only partially, the person is said to have a ptosis.KEY TERMS\\nGamma knife —A surgical tool that focuses beams\\nof radiation at the head, which converge in thebrain to form a lesion.\\nLesion —Any discontinuity of tissue. Often a cut or\\nwound.\\nLimbic system —A portion of the brain on the\\ninner edge of the cerebral cortex that is thought toregulate emotions.\\nPsychosurgery —Brain surgery performed to allevi-\\nate chronic psychological conditions such asobsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), depression,and bipolar disorder.\\nStereotactic technique —A technique used by\\nneurosurgeons to pinpoint locations within thebrain. It employs computer imaging to create anexternal frame of reference. There are two types of ptosis, acquired and congeni-\\ntal. Acquired ptosis is more common. Congenital ptosisis present at birth. Both congenital and acquired ptosiscan be, but are not necessarily, hereditary.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPtosis may occur because the levator muscle’s\\nattachment to the lid is weakening with age. Acquiredptosis can also be caused by a number of differentthings, such as disease that impairs the nerves, diabetes,injury, tumors, inflammation, or aneurysms. Congenitalptosis may be caused by a problem with nerve innerva-tion or a weak muscle. Drooping eyelids may also be theresult of diseases such as myotonic dystrophy or myas-\\nthenia gravis .\\nThe primary symptom of ptosis is a drooping eyelid.\\nAdults will notice a loss of visual field because the upperportion of the eye is covered. Children who are born with aptosis usually tilt their head back in an effort to see under theobstruction. Some people raise their eyebrows in order to liftthe lid slightly and therefore may appear to be frowning.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of ptosis is usually made by observing the\\ndrooping eyelid. Finding the cause of the condition willrequire testing for any of the illnesses or injuries knownto have this effect. Some possible tests include x rays andblood tests.\\nTreatment\\nPtosis is usually treated surgically. Surgery can gen-\\nerally be done on an outpatient basis under local anes-thetic.

For more pronounced ptosis the\\napproach is to surgically shorten the levator muscle orconnect the lid to the muscles of the eyebrow. Or, theaponeurosis can be reattached to the tarsal plate if it hasseparated. Correcting the ptosis is usually done only afterdetermining the cause of the condition. For example,myasthenia gravis must be ruled out before performingany surgery. As with any surgery, there are risks, and theyshould be discussed with the surgeon.\\nChildren with ptosis need not have surgery immedi-\\nately, however their vision must be checked periodicallyto prevent lazy eye ( amblyopia ).\\n“Ptosis crutches” are also available. These can be\\nattached to the frame of eyeglasses to hold up the eyelid.These devices are uncomfortable and usually not welltolerated.\\nPrognosis\\nAfter diagnosing the cause of a drooping eyelid,\\nthen correcting the condition, most people have no fur-ther problems related to the ptosis.

In turn, the pituitary releases its own hormonescalled gonadotrophins that stimulate the gonads andadrenals. From these glands come a flood of sex hor-mones—androgens and testosterone in the male, estro-gens and progestins in the female—that regulate thegrowth and function of the sex organs. It is interesting tonote that the gonadotrophins are the same for males andfemales, but the sex hormones they induce are different.\\nIn the United States, the first sign of puberty occurs on\\naverage at age 11 in girls, with menstruation and fertilityfollowing about two years later. Boys lag behind by abouttwo years. Puberty may not begin until age 16 in boys andcontinue in a desultory fashion on past age 20. In contrastto puberty, adolescence is more of a social/cultural termreferring to the interval between childhood and adulthood.\\nDiagnosis\\nPuberty has been divided into five Sexual Maturity\\nRating (SMR) stages by two doctors, W. Marshall and J.M. Tanner. These ratings are often referred to as TannerStages 1–5. Staging is based on pubic hair growth, onmale genital development, and female breast development.Staging helps determine whether development is normalfor a given age. Both sexes also grow axillary (arm pit)hair and pimples. Males develop muscle mass, a deepervoice, and facial hair. Females redistribute body fat. Alongwith the maturing of the sex organs, there is a pronouncedgrowth spurt averaging 3–4 in (8–10 cm) and culminatingin full adult stature. Puberty can be precocious (early) ordelayed. It all depends upon the sex hormones.\\nPuberty falling outside the age limits considered nor-\\nmal for any given population should prompt a search forthe cause. As health and nutrition have improved over the\\npast few generations, there has been a gradual decrease inthe average age for the normal onset of puberty.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2772Puberty'),\n",

It can come from the brain in the form\\nof gonadotrophins or from the gonads and adrenals.Overproduction may be caused by functioning tumorsor simple overactivity. Brain overproduction can alsobe the result of brain infections or injury.\\n• Likewise, delayed puberty is due to insufficient hor-\\nmone. If the pituitary output is inadequate, so will bethe output from the gonads and adrenals. On the otherhand, a normal pituitary will overproduce if it sensesthere are not enough hormones in the circulation.\\n• There are several congenital disorders ( polyglandular\\ndeficiency syndromes ) that include failure of hormone\\noutput. These children do not experience normal puber-ty, but it may be induced by giving them the proper hor-mones at the proper time.\\n• Finally, there are in females abnormalities in hormone\\nproduction that produce male characteristics—so calledvirilizing syndromes. Should one of these appear duringadolescence, it will disturb the normal progress of puber-ty. Notice that virilizing requires abnormal hormones inthe female, while feminizing results from absent hor-mones in the male. Each embryo starts out life as female.Male hormones transform it if they are present.\\nDelayed or precocious puberty requires measure-\\nment of the several hormones involved to determinewhich are lacking or which are in excess. There are bloodtests for each one. If a tumor is suspected, imaging of thesuspect organ needs to be done with x rays, computed\\ntomography scans (CT scans), or magnetic resonance\\nimaging (MRI).\\nTreatment\\nPuberty is a period of great stress , both physically and\\nemotionally. The psychological changes and challenges ofpuberty are made infinitely greater if its timing is off.\\nIn preocious puberty, the offending gland or tumor may\\nrequire surgical attention, although there are several drugsnow that counteract hormone effects. If delayed, pubertycan be stimulated with the correct hormones. Treatmentshould not be delayed because necessary bone growth isalso affected.\\nPrognosis\\nProperly administered hormones can restore the nor-\\nmal growth pattern.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCurrent Medical Diagnosis and Treatment, 1996. 35th ed.

The gen-\\nital tract, particularly the uterus, is the most commonlyinfected site. In some cases infection can spread to otherpoints in the body. Widespread infection, or sepsis , is a\\nrare, but potentially fatal complication.\\nDescription\\nPuerperal infection affects an estimated 1–8% of\\nnew mothers in the United States. Given modern medicaltreatment and antibiotics , it very rarely advances to the\\npoint of threatening a woman’s life. An estimated 2–4%of new mothers who deliver vaginally suffer some formof puerperal infection, but for cesarean sections, the fig-ure is five-10 times higher.\\nDeaths related to puerperal infection are very rare in\\nthe industrialized world. It is estimated three in 100,000births result in maternal death due to infection. However,\\nthe death rate in developing nations may be 100 timeshigher.\\nPostpartum fever may arise from several causes, not\\nnecessarily infection. If the fever is related to infection, itoften results from endometritis, an inflammation of theuterus. Urinary tract, breast, and wound infections arealso possible, as well as septic thrombophlebitis ,a\\nblood clot-associated inflammation of veins. A woman’ssusceptibility to developing an infection is related tosuch factors as cesarean section , extended labor,\\nobesity , anemia, and poor prenatal nutrition .\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe primary symptom of puerperal infection is a\\nfever at any point between birth and 10 days postpartum.A temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) on any two days duringthis period, or a fever of 101.6°F (38.6 °C) in the first 24hours postpartum, is cause for suspicion. An assortmentof bacterial species may cause puerperal infection. Manyof these bacteria are normally found in the mother’s geni-tal tract, but other bacteria may be introduced from thewoman’s intestine and skin or from a healthcare provider.\\nThe associated symptoms depend on the site and\\nnature of the infection. The most typical site of infectionis the genital tract. Endometritis, which affects theuterus, is the most prominent of these infections.Endometritis is much more common if a small part of theplacenta has been retained in the uterus. Typically, sever-al species of bacteria are involved and may act synergis-tically—that is, the bacteria’s negative effects are multi-plied rather than simply added together. Synergisticaction by the bacteria can result in a stubborn infectionsuch as an abscess . The major symptoms of a genital\\ntract infection include fever, malaise, abdominal pain ,uterine tenderness, and abnormal vaginal discharge. If\\nthese symptoms do not respond to antibiotic therapy, anabscess or blood clot may be suspected.\\nOther causes of postpartum fever include urinary\\ntract infections, wound infections, septic throm-bophlebitis, and mastitis . Mastitis, or breast infection, is\\nindicated by fever, malaise, achy muscles, and reddenedskin on the affected breast. It is usually caused by aclogged milk duct that becomes infected. Infections ofthe urinary tract are indicated by fever, frequent andpainful urination, and back pain. An episiotomy and a\\ncesarean section carry the risk of a wound infection.Such infections are suggested by a fever and pus-like dis-charge, inflammation, and swelling at wound sites.\\nDiagnosis\\nFever is not an automatic indicator of puerperal\\ninfection. A new mother may have a fever owing to priorillness or an illness unconnected to childbirth. However,any fever within 10 days postpartum is aggressivelyinvestigated. Physical symptoms such as pain, malaise,loss of appetite, and others point to infection.\\nMany doctors initiate antibiotic therapy early in the\\nfever period to stop an infection before it advances. Apelvic examination is done and samples are taken from thegenital tract to identify the bacteria involved in the infec-tion. The pelvic examination can reveal the extent of infec-tion and possibly the cause. Blood samples may also betaken for blood counts and to test for the presence of infec-tious bacteria. A urinalysis may also be ordered, especially\\nif the symptoms are indicative of a urinary tract infection.\\nIf the fever and other symptoms resist antibiotic thera-\\npy, an ultrasound examination or computed tomographyscan (CT scan) is done to locate potential abscesses orblood clots in the pelvic region. Magnetic resonance\\nimaging (MRI) may be useful as well, in addition to a\\nheparin challenge test if blood clots are suspected. If a lunginfection is suspected, a chest x ray may also be ordered.\\nTreatment\\nAntibiotic therapy is the backbone of puerperal\\ninfection treatment. Initial antibiotic therapy may consistof clindamycin and gentamicin, which fight a broad arrayof bacteria types. If the fever and other symptoms do notrespond to these antibiotics, a third, such as ampicillin, isadded. Other antibiotics may be used depending on theidentity of the infective bacteria and the possibility of anallergic reaction to certain antibiotics.\\nAntibiotics taken together are effective against a\\nwide range of bacteria, but may not be capable of clearingup the infection alone, especially if an abscess or blood\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2774Puerperal infection'),\n",

Heparin is combined with the antibiotic\\ntherapy in order to break apart blood clots. Heparin isused for five-seven days, and may be followed by war-farin for the following month. If the infection is compli-cated, it may be necessary to surgically drain the infectedsite. Infected episiotomies can be opened and allowed todrain, but abscesses and blood clots may require surgery.\\nPrognosis\\nAntibiotic therapy and other treatment measures are\\nvirtually always successful in curing puerperal infections.\\nPrevention\\nCareful attention to antiseptic procedures during\\nchildbirth is the basic underpinning of preventing infec-tion.

Pul-monary edema is a common complication of heart disor-ders, and most cases of the condition are associated withheart failure . Pulmonary edema can be a chronic condi-\\ntion, or it can develop suddenly and quickly become lifethreatening. The life-threatening type of pulmonaryedema occurs when a large amount of fluid suddenlyshifts from the pulmonary blood vessels into the lung, dueto lung problems, heart attack , trauma, or toxic chemi-\\ncals. It can also be the first sign of coronary heart disease.\\nIn heart-related pulmonary edema, the heart’s main\\nchamber, the left ventricle, is weakened and does not func-tion properly. The ventricle does not completely eject itscontents, causing blood to back up and cardiac output todrop. The body responds by increasing blood pressure andfluid volume to compensate for the reduced cardiac output.This, in turn, increases the force against which the ventriclemust expel blood. Blood backs up, forming a pool in thepulmonary blood vessels. Fluid leaks into the spacesbetween the tissues of the lungs and begins to accumulate.This process makes it more difficult for the lungs to expand.It also impedes the exchange of air and gases between thelungs and blood moving through lung blood vessels.Causes and symptoms\\nMost cases of pulmonary edema are caused by failure\\nof the heart’s main chamber, the left ventricle. It can bebrought on by an acute heart attack, severe ischemia , vol-\\nume overload of the heart’s left ventricle, and mitral steno-sis. Non-heart-related pulmonary edema is caused by lungproblems like pneumonia , an excess of intravenous fluids,\\nsome types of kidney disease, bad burns , liver disease,\\nnutritional problems, and Hodgkin’s disease . Non-heart-\\nrelated pulmonary edema can also be caused by other con-ditions where the lungs do not drain properly, and condi-tions where the respiratory veins are blocked.\\nEarly symptoms of pulmonary edema include:\\n• shortness of breath upon exertion\\n• sudden respiratory distress after sleep\\n• difficulty breathing, except when sitting upright• Coughing\\nIn cases of severe pulmonary edema, these symp-\\ntoms will worsen to:\\n• labored and rapid breathing• frothy, bloody fluid containing pus coughed from the\\nlungs (sputum)\\n• a fast pulse and possibly serious disturbances in the\\nheart’s rhythm (atrial fibrillation, for example)\\n• cold, clammy, sweaty, and bluish skin• a drop in blood pressure resulting in a thready pulse\\nDiagnosis\\nA doctor can usually diagnose pulmonary edema\\nbased on the patient’s symptoms and a physical exam.Patients with pulmonary edema will have a rapid pulse,rapid breathing, abnormal breath and heart sounds, andenlarged neck veins. A chest x ray is often used to con-\\nfirm the diagnosis. Arterial blood gas testing may bedone. Sometimes pulmonary artery catheterization is\\nperformed to confirm that the patient has pulmonaryedema and not a disease with similar symptoms (calledadult respiratory distress syndrome or “noncardio-\\ngenic pulmonary edema”).\\nTreatment\\nPulmonary edema requires immediate emergency\\ntreatment. Treatment includes: placing the patient in asitting position, oxygen, assisted or mechanical ventila-tion (in some cases), and drug therapy. The goal of treat-ment is to reduce the amount of fluid in the lungs,improve gas exchange and heart function, and, wherepossible, to correct the underlying disease.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2778Pulmonary edema'),\n",

High concentrations of oxygen areadministered. In cases where respiratory distress issevere, a mechanical ventilator and a tube down thethroat (tracheal intubation) will be used to improve thedelivery of oxygen. Non-invasive pressure support ven-tilation is a new treatment for pulmonary edema inwhich the patient breathes against a continuous flow ofpositive airway pressure, delivered through a face ornasal mask. Non-invasive pressure support ventilationdecreases the effort required to breathe, enhances oxy-gen and carbon dioxide exchange, and increases car-diac output.\\nDrug therapy could include morphine, nitroglyc-\\nerin, diuretics , angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)\\ninhibitors, and vasodilators . Vasopressors are used for\\ncardiogenic shock. Morphine is very effective in reduc-ing the patient’s anxiety , easing breathing, and improv-\\ning blood flow. Nitroglycerin reduces pulmonary bloodflow and decreases the volume of fluid entering theoverloaded blood vessels. Diuretics, like furosemide(Lasix), promote the elimination of fluids through uri-nation, helping to reduce pressure and fluids in theblood vessels. ACE inhibitors reduce the pressureagainst which the left ventricle must expel blood. Inpatients who have severe hypertension , a vasodilator\\nsuch as nitroprusside sodium (Nipride) may be used.For cardiogenic shock, an adrenergic agent (likedopamine hydrochloride [Intropin], dobutaminehydrochloride [Dobutrex], or epinephrine) or a bipyri-dine (like amrinone lactate [Inocor] or milrinone lactate[Primacor]) are given.\\nPrognosis\\nMost patients with pulmonary edema who seek\\nimmediate treatment can be treated quickly and effec-tively.\\nPrevention\\nCardiogenic pulmonary edema can sometimes be\\nprevented by treating the underlying heart disease.

When emboli block the main pulmonaryartery, pulmonary embolism can quickly become fatal.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPulmonary embolism is caused by emboli that travel\\nthrough the blood stream to the lungs and block a pul-monary artery. When this occurs, circulation and oxy-genation of blood is compromised. The emboli are usual-ly formed from blood clots but are occasionally com-prised of air, fat, or tumor tissue.

The lung scan showspoor flow of blood in areas beyond blocked arteries. Thepatient inhales a small amount of radiopharmaceuticaland pictures of airflow into the lungs are taken with agamma camera. Then a different radiopharmaceutical isinjected into an arm vein and lung blood flow is scanned.A normal result essentially rules out pulmonaryembolism. A lung scan can be performed in a hospital oran outpatient facility and takes about 45 minutes.\\nPulmonary angiography is the most reliable test for\\ndiagnosing pulmonary embolism but it is not used often,because it carries some risk and is expensive, invasive, andnot readily available in many hospitals. Pulmonary angiog-raphy is a radiographic test which involves injection of apharmaceutical “contrast agent” to show up the pulmonaryarteries. A cinematic camera records the blood flowthrough the lungs of the patient, who lies on a table. Pul-monary angiography is usually performed in a hospital’sradiology department and takes 30 minutes to one hour.\\nAn electrocardiograph shows the heart’s electrical\\nactivity and helps distinguish pulmonary embolism froma heart attack. Electrodes covered with conducting jellyare placed on the patient’s chest, arms, and legs. Impuls-es of the heart’s activity are traced on paper. The testtakes about 10 minutes and can be performed in a physi-cian’s office or hospital lab.\\nArterial blood gas measurements can be helpful, but\\nthey are rarely diagnostic for pulmonary embolism.Blood is taken from an artery instead of a vein, usually inthe wrist and it is analyzed for oxygen, carbon dioxideand acid levels.\\nVenography is used to look for the most likely source\\nof pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis.

A contrast solution is injected into afoot vein through a catheter. The physician observes themovement of the solution through the vein with a fluoro-scope while a series of x rays are taken. Venography takesbetween 30–45 minutes and can be done in a physician’soffice, a laboratory, or a hospital. Radionuclide venogra-phy, in which a radioactive isotope is injected, is occa-sionally used, especially if a patient has had reactions tocontrast solutions. Most commonly performed are ultra-sound and Doppler studies of leg veins.\\nTreatment\\nPatients with pulmonary embolism are hospitalized\\nand generally treated with clot-dissolving and clot-pre-venting drugs. Oxygen therapy is often needed to main-tain normal oxygen concentrations. For people who can’ttake anticoagulants and in some other cases, surgery maybe needed to insert a device that filters blood returning tothe heart and lungs. The goal of treatment is to maintainthe patient’s cardiovascular and respiratory functionswhile the blockage resolves, which takes 10–14 days,and to prevent the formation of other emboli.\\nThrombolytic therapy to dissolve blood clots is the\\naggressive treatment for very severe pulmonaryembolism. Streptokinase, urokinase, and recombinanttissue plasminogen activator (TPA) are thrombolyticagents. Heparin is the injectable anticoagulant (clot-pre-venting) drug of choice for preventing formation ofblood clots. Warfarin, an oral anticoagulant, is usuallycontinued when the patient leaves the hospital anddoesn’t need heparin any longer.\\nPrognosis\\nAbout 10% of patients with pulmonary embolism\\ndie suddenly within the first hour of onset of the condi-tion.

The pulmonary artery carries oxygen-poor bloodfrom the lower chamber on the right side of the heart(right ventricle) to the lungs where it picks up oxygen.\\nDescription\\nPulmonary hypertension is present when the blood\\npressure in the circulation of the lungs is measured atgreater than 25 mm of mercury (Hg) at rest or 30 mm Hgduring exercise . Pulmonary hypertension can be either\\nprimary or secondary:\\n• Primary pulmonary hypertension. The cause of pul-\\nmonary hypertension is unknown. It is rare, affectingtwo people per one million. The illness most oftenoccurs in young adults, especially women.\\n• Secondary pulmonary hypertension. Secondary pul-\\nmonary hypertension is increased pressure of theblood vessels of the lungs as a result of other medicalconditions.\\nRegardless of whether pulmonary hypertension is\\nprimary or secondary, the disorder results in thickeningof the pulmonary arteries and narrowing of these bloodvessels. In response, the right side of the heart worksharder to move the blood through these arteries and itbecomes enlarged. Eventually overworking the right sideof the heart may lead to right-sided heart failure , result-\\ning in death .\\nCauses and symptoms\\nWhile the cause of primary pulmonary hypertension\\nis uncertain, researchers think that in most people whoKEY TERMS\\nEmphysema —A disease in which the small air\\nsacs in the lungs become damaged, causing short-ness of breath. In severe cases it can lead to respi-ratory or heart failure.develop the disease, the blood vessels are sensitive to\\ncertain factors that cause them to narrow. Diet suppres-sants, cocaine , and pregnancy are some of the factors\\nthat are thought to trigger constriction or narrowing ofthe pulmonary artery. In about 6–10% of cases, primarypulmonary hypertension is inherited.\\nSecondary pulmonary hypertension can be associ-\\nated with breathing disorders such as emphysema and\\nbronchitis , or diseases such as scleroderma ,systemic\\nlupus erythematosus (SLE) or congenital heart dis-\\nease involving heart valves, and pulmonary throm-\\nboembolism.\\nSymptoms of pulmonary hypertension include\\nshortness of breath with minimal exertion, general\\nfatigue ,dizziness , and fainting . Swelling of the ankles,\\nbluish lips and skin, and chest pain are among other\\nsymptoms of the disease.\\nDiagnosis\\nPulmonary hypertension is rarely detected during\\nroutine physical examinations and, therefore, oftenprogresses to later stages before being diagnosed. Inaddition to listening to heart sounds with a stetho-scope, physicians also use electrocardiogram, pul-monary function tests, perfusion lung scan, and/orright-heart cardiac catheterization to diagnose pul-\\nmonary hypertension.\\nTreatment\\nThe aim of treatment for pulmonary hypertension is\\nto treat the underlying cause, if it is known. For example,thromboendarterectomy is a surgical procedure per-formed to remove a blood clot on the lung that is causingthe pulmonary hypertension. Lung transplants are anoth-er surgical treatment.\\nSome patients are helped by taking medicines that\\nmake the work of the heart easier. Anticoagulants, drugsthat thin the blood, decrease the tendency of the blood toclot and allow blood to flow more freely. Diuretics\\ndecrease the amount of fluid in the body and reduce theamount of work the heart has to do. Calcium channel\\nblockers relax the smooth muscle in the walls of the\\nheart and blood vessels and improve the ability of theheart to pump blood.\\nOne effective medical treatment that dilates blood\\nvessels and seems to help prevent blood clots from form-ing is epoprostenol (prostacyclin). Prostacyclin is givenintravenously to improve survival, exercise duration, andwell-being. It is sometimes used as a bridge to help peo-ple who are waiting for a lung transplant.

The pul-monary valve is the structure in the pulmonary arteryconsisting of three flaps, which open and close duringeach heartbeat. The flaps keep blood from flowing backinto the heart from the pulmonary artery—the artery thatsupplies blood to the lungs. With pulmonary valve insuf-ficiency, the flaps may allow the blood to flow backward,resulting in a distinct murmur. The disorder may be con-genital, but also often occurs in patients with severe pul-\\nmonary hypertension .\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are generally few to no symptoms with pul-\\nmonary valve insufficiency. It may be initially noticedas a murmur in a routine exam of the heart and chestwith a stethoscope. The most common causes of thedisorder are severe pulmonary hypertension , or the\\npresence of high pressure in the arteries and veins of thelungs. Pulmonary hypertension is usually caused bychronic lung disease, lung blood clots, and sometimesother diseases, such as endocarditis , an inflammation\\nof the lining of the heart and valves. Previous surgeryfor congenital heart disease may also cause pul-\\nmonary valve insufficiency.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2786Pulmonary valve insufficiency'),\n",

An electrocardiogram (EKG) can detectflow changes. Echocardiography with color Doppler\\ncan usually detect regurgitation of blood in the area. Thisexam is done with ultrasound imaging. A chest x ray\\nmay show prominence of the pulmonary artery. In somecases, angiocardiography, or x ray of the arteries and ves-sels with injection of a dye, may be ordered.\\nTreatment\\nOn its own, pulmonary valve insufficiency is seldom\\nsevere enough to require treatment. Antibiotics are usu-\\nally recommended before dental work to reduce the pos-sibility of bacterial endocarditis. Management of the pri-mary condition, such as medications to manage pul-monary hypertension, may help control pulmonary valveinsufficiency.\\nAlternative treatment\\nSince there are few or no symptoms and the disorder\\nis a structural defect, alternative treatment may have onlylimited usefulness. Proper diet, exercise , and stress\\nreduction may help control hypertension. Coenzyme\\nQ10 and hawthorn ( Crataegus laevigata ) are two impor-\\ntant nutrients to nourish the heart. Antioxidant supple-ments (including vitamins A, C, and E, selenium, and\\nzinc) can help keep the tissues of the whole body, includ-ing the heart, in optimal condition.\\nPrognosis\\nPatients with this disorder may never experience\\nlimitations from pulmonary valve insufficiency. Thedisorder may only show up if complicated by pul-monary hypertension. There is an increased incidenceof bacterial endocarditis in patients with pulmonaryvalve insufficiency. Endocarditis can progress rapidlyand be fatal.\\nPrevention\\nPulmonary valve insufficiency resulting from chron-\\nic lung diseases can be prevented by behaviors and inter-ventions to prevent those primary diseases.

Normally, the pulmonary valveopens to let blood flow from the right ventricle to thelungs. When the pulmonary valve is malformed, it forcesthe right ventricle to pump harder to overcome theobstruction.

In most cases, scientists don’t knowwhy it occurs. In cases of mild or moderate stenosis,there are often no symptoms. With more severeobstruction, symptoms include a bluish skin tint andsigns of heart failure .\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of pulmonary valve stenosis begins with\\nthe patient’s medical history and a physical exam. Teststo confirm the diagnosis include chest x ray , echocardio-\\ngram, electrocardiogram, and catherization. An electro-cardiograph shows the heart’s activity. Electrodes cov-ered with conducting jelly are placed on the patient. Theelectrodes send impulses that are traced on a recorder.Echocardiography uses sound waves to create an image\\nof the heart’s chambers and valves. The technicianapplies gel to a wand (transducer) and presses it againstthe patient’s chest. The returning sound waves are con-verted into an image displayed on a monitor. Catheriza-tion is an invasive procedure used to diagnose, and insome cases treat, heart problems. A thin tube, called acatheter, is inserted into a blood vessel and threaded upinto the heart, enabling physicians to see and sometimescorrect the problems.\\nTreatment\\nPatients with mild to moderate pulmonary valve\\nstenosis, and few or no symptoms, do not require treat-ment. In more severe cases, the blocked valve will beopened surgically, either through balloon valvuloplasty\\nor surgical valvulotomy. For initial treatment, balloonvalvuloplasty is the procedure of choice. This is a cather-ization procedure in which a special catheter containing adeflated balloon is inserted in a blood vessel and thread-ed up into the heart. The catheter is positioned in the nar-rowed heart valve and the balloon is inflated to stretchthe valve open.\\nIn some cases, surgical valvulotomy may be neces-\\nsary.

Left untreated or unresolved, it can progress to achronic condition that lasts for months or years, leadingto scarring and possible loss of kidney function.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe most common cause of pyelonephritis is the\\nbackward flow (reflux) of infected urine from the bladderto the upper urinary tract. Bacterial infections may also becarried to one or both kidneys through the bloodstream orlymph glands from infection that began in the bladder.Kidney infection sometimes results from urine thatbecomes stagnant due to obstruction of free urinary flow.A blockage or abnormality of the urinary system, such asthose caused by stones, tumors, congenital deformities, orloss of bladder function from nerve disease, increases aperson’s risk of pyelonephritis. Other risk factors includediabetes mellitus ,pregnancy , chronic bladder infec-\\ntions, a history of analgesic abuse, paralysis from spinal\\ncord injury , or tumors. Catheters, tubes, or surgical pro-\\ncedures may also trigger a kidney infection.\\nThe bacteria that are most likely to cause\\npyelonephritis are those that normally occur in thefeces. Escherichia coli causes about 85% of acute blad-\\nder and kidney infections in patients with no obstruc-tion or history of surgical procedures. Klebsiella ,Enter-\\nobacter ,Proteus ,o rPseudomonas are other common\\ncauses of infection. Once these organisms enter the uri-nary tract, they cling to the tissues that line the tract andmultiply in them.\\nSymptoms of acute pyelonephritis typically include\\nfever and chills, burning or frequent urination, aching\\npain on one or both sides of the lower back or abdomen,\\ncloudy or bloody urine, and fatigue . The patient may\\nalso have nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea . The flank\\npain may be extreme. The symptoms of chronicpyelonephritis include weakness, loss of appetite, hyper-\\ntension , anemia, and protein and blood in the urine.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of pyelonephritis is based on the\\npatient’s history, a physical examination , and the results\\nof laboratory and imaging tests. During the physicalexamination, the doctor will touch (palpate) the patient’sabdomen carefully in order to rule out appendicitis or\\nother causes of severe abdominal pain.\\nLaboratory tests\\nIn addition to collecting urine samples for urinaly-\\nsisand urine culture and sensitivity tests, the doctor will\\ntake a sample of the patient’s blood for a blood cellcount. If the patient has pyelonephritis, the urine testswill show the presence of white blood cells, and bacteriain the urine. Bacterial counts of 100,000 organisms orhigher per milliliter of urine point to a urinary tract infec-tion. The presence of antibody-coated bacteria (ACB) inthe urine sample distinguishes kidney infection frombladder infection, because bacteria in the kidney triggeran antibody response that coats the bacteria. The bloodcell count usually indicates a sharp increase in the num-ber of white blood cells.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2789Pyelonephritis'),\n",

X rays may demonstrate scar-ring of the kidneys and ureters resulting from long-stand-ing infection.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of acute pyelonephritis may require hos-\\npitalization if the patient is severely ill or has complica-tions. Therapy most often involves a two- to three-weekcourse of antibiotics , with the first few days of treatment\\ngiven intravenously. The choice of antibiotic is based onlaboratory sensitivity studies. The antibiotics that areused most often include ciprofloxacin (Cipro), ampicillin(Omnipen), or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim,Septra). The primary objective of antimicrobial therapyis the permanent eradication of bacteria from the urinarytract. The early symptoms of pyelonephritis usually dis-appear within 48 to 72 hours of the start of antibacterialtreatment. Repeat urine cultures are done in order toevaluate the effectiveness of the medication.\\nChronic pyelonephritis may require high doses of\\nantibiotics for as long as six months to clear the infection.Other medications may be given to control fever, nausea,and pain. Patients are encouraged to drink extra fluid toprevent dehydration and increase urine output. Surgery is\\nsometimes necessary if the patient has complicationscaused by kidney stones or other obstructions, or to eradi-\\ncate infection. Urine cultures are repeated as part of the fol-low-up of patients with chronic pyelonephritis. Theserepeat tests are necessary to evaluate the possibility that thepatient’s urinary tract is infected with a second organism aswell as to assess the patient’s response to the antibiotic.Some persons are highly susceptible to reinfection, and asecond antibiotic may be necessary to treat the organism.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for most patients with acute pyelon-\\nephritis is quite good if the infection is caught early andtreated promptly. The patient is considered cured if theurine remains sterile for a year. Untreated or recurrentkidney infection can lead to bacterial invasion of the\\nbloodstream ( bacteremia ), hypertension, chronic pyelon-\\nephritis with scarring of the kidneys, and permanent kid-ney damage.\\nPrevention\\nPersons with a history of urinary tract infections\\nshould urinate frequently, and drink plenty of fluids atthe first sign of infection.

The pylorus is the passage between the stomachand the small intestine. During the digestive process foodpasses through the pylorus, which is located near the bot-tom of the stomach, on its way to the intestines. Inpyloric stenosis, the muscular wall of the passagebecomes abnormally thickened. This causes the pylorusto become too narrow, which prevents food from empty-ing out of the stomach in a normal fashion. The partiallydigested contents of the stomach are forced upwards intothe mouth. As a result, a baby with pyloric stenosis oftenvomits after feedings.\\nThe condition affects one in 4,000 infants. Most are\\ndiagnosed between three and five weeks old, though somebabies may show symptoms during the first or secondweek of life. Infants with a family history of pyloric steno-sis are more at risk for the condition, which tends to occurless often in females, blacks, and Asians. Pyloric stenosisis also referred to as hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of pyloric stenosis is not known. The main\\nsymptom is vomiting after feedings. These episodes ofvomiting usually get worse over time, happening moreoften and becoming more forceful (forceful vomiting isoften called “projectile” vomiting). Other symptomsinclude increased appetite, weight loss, infrequent bowelmovements, belching, and diarrhea . Due to\\ndehydration , the infant may also have fewer wet diapers.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe clinician will examine the baby and talk with\\nthe parents about their infant’s symptoms. If a child hasthe condition, the doctor should be able to feel a hardmass (about 2 cm wide and olive shaped) in the areaabove the bellybutton. If the doctor cannot detect themass, ultrasonography will be done to confirm the diag-nosis. A blood test may also be performed to see if theinfant is dehydrated, in which case intravenous fluids canbe used to correct the problem.\\nTreatment\\nPyloric stenosis can be cured with a surgical procedure\\ncalled a pyloromyotomy.

Pyloroplasty is a treatment forhigh-risk patients for gastric or peptic ulcer disease. Apeptic ulcer is a well-defined sore on the stomach wherethe lining of the stomach or duodenum has been eatenway by stomach acid and digestive juices.\\nPurpose\\nThe end of the pylorus is surrounded by a strong\\nband of muscle (pyloric sphincter), through which stom-ach contents are emptied into the duodenum (the firstpart of the small intestine). Pyloroplasty widens thisopening into the duodenum.\\nA pyloroplasty is performed to treat complications of\\ngastric ulcer disease, or when conservative treatment isunsatisfactory. The longitudinal cut made in the pylorus isclosed transversely, permitting the muscle to relax. Byestablishing an enlarged outlet from the stomach into theintestine, the stomach empties more quickly. A pyloro-plasty is often done is conjunction with a vagotomy ,a\\nprocedure in which the nerves that stimulate stomach acidproduction and gastric motility (movement) are cut. Asthese nerves are cut, gastric emptying may be delayed,and the pyloroplasty compensates for that effect.\\nPreparation\\nAs with any surgical procedure, the patient will be\\nrequired to sign a consent form after the procedure isexplained thoroughly. Blood and urine studies, along withvarious x rays may be ordered as the doctor deems neces-sary. Food and fluids will be prohibited after midnightbefore the procedure. Cleansing enemas may be ordered\\nto empty the intestine. If nausea or vomiting are present, asuction tube to empty the stomach may be used.\\nAftercare\\nPost-operative care for the patient who has had a\\npyloroplasty, as for those who have had any major surgery,involves monitoring of blood pressure, pulse, respiration,and temperature. Breathing tends to be shallow because ofthe effect of anesthesia and the patient’s reluctance tobreathe deeply and experience pain that is caused by the\\nabdominal incision. The patient is shown how to supportthe operative site while breathing deeply and coughing,and given pain medication as necessary. Fluid intake andoutput is measured, and the operative site is observed forcolor and wound drainage. Fluids are given intravenouslyfor 24–48 hours, until the patient’s diet is graduallyadvanced as bowel activity resumes. The patient is gener-ally allowed to walk approximately eight hours aftersurgery and the average hospital stay, dependent uponoverall recovery status, ranges from six to eight days.\\nRisks\\nPotential complications of this abdominal surgery\\ninclude:\\n• excessive bleeding• surgical wound infection• incisional hernia\\n• recurrence of gastric ulcer• chronic diarrhea\\n• malnutrition\\nNormal results\\nComplete healing is expected without complica-\\ntions. Four to six weeks should be allowed for recoveryfrom the surgery.\\nAbnormal results\\nThe doctor should be made aware of any of the fol-\\nlowing problems after surgery:\\n• increased pain, swelling, redness, drainage, or bleeding\\nin the surgical area\\n• headache, muscle aches, dizziness , or fever\\n• increased abdominal pain or swelling, constipation ,\\nnausea or vomiting, rectal bleeding, or black, tarrystools.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nMonahan, Frances.

Usually, pyruvate kinase actsas a catalyst in the glycolysis pathway, and is consideredan essential component in this pathway. Glycolysis is themethod by which cells produce their own energy. A prob-lem with any of the key components in glycolysis canalter the amount of energy produced. In the red bloodcells, glycolysis is the only method available to produceenergy. Without the proper amount of energy, the redblood cells do not function normally. Since pyruvatekinase is one of the key components in glycolysis, whenthere is a problem with this enzyme in the red bloodcells, there is a problem with the production of energy,causing the red blood cells not to function properly.\\nThere are four different forms of the pyruvate kinase\\nenzyme in the human body. These forms, calledisozymes, all perform the same function but eachisozyme of pyruvate kinase is structurally different andworks in different tissues and organs. The four isozymesof pyruvate kinase are labeled M1, M2, L, and R. Theisozyme M1 is found in the skeletal muscle and brain,isozyme M2 can be found in most fetal and adult tissues,isozyme L works in the liver, and isozyme R works in thered blood cells. In PKD, only the pyruvate kinaseisozyme found in red blood cells, called PKR, is abnor-mal. Therefore, PKD only affects the red blood cells anddoes not directly affect the energy production in the otherorgans and tissues of the body.\\nIn general, PKD not does appear to affect one gen-\\nder more than another or be more common in certainregions. However, there are studies of an Amish group inPennsylvania where a severe form of PKD is more com-mon. As previously mentioned, the three mutationsfound in the PKLR gene have been linked to individualsof specific decents. Caucasians of northern and centralEuropean decent are more likely to have the 1529Amutations, individuals of southern European descent usu-ally have the 1456T mutation, and individuals of Asiandescent are more likely to have the 1468T mutation.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are two PK genes and each gene produces two\\nof the four isozymes of pyruvate kinase. The M1 and M2isozymes are produced by the pyruvate kinase genecalled PKM2 and pyruvate kinase isozymes, L and R, areproducts of the pyruvate kinase gene, PKLR.

There have been a few families where itappeared that PKD was inherited in either an autosomaldominant manner or where the carriers of PKD exhibitedmild problems with their red blood cells. As with allautosomal recessive conditions, affected individuals havea mutation in both pair of genes. Most individuals withPKD are compound heterozygotes, meaning that eachPKLR gene in a pair contains a different mutation. Thereare individuals who have the same mutation on eachPKLR gene, but these individuals tend to be children ofparents who are related to each other.\\nThere are three mutations in the PKLR gene called,\\n1529A, 1456T, and 1468T, that are seen more frequentlyin individuals with PKD than the other mutations. Themutation 1529A is most frequently seen in Caucasians ofnorthern and central European descent and is the mostcommon mutation seen in PKD. The mutation 1456T ismore common in individuals of southern Europeandescent and the mutation 1468T is more common in indi-viduals of Asian descent.\\nIn general, the more severe the PKD, the earlier in\\nlife symptoms tend to be detected.

In indi-\\nviduals with the more mild form of PKD, the condition issometimes not diagnosed until late adulthood, after anacute illness, or during a pregnancy evaluation.\\nFor most of the mutations seen in the PKLR gene, no\\ncorrelation between the specific mutation and the severityof the disorder has been observed. However, for two of themutations, there has been speculation on their effect on theseverity of PKD. When the mutation 1456T has been seenin the homozygous state (when both PKLR genes containthe same mutation), those rare individuals experiencedvery mild symptoms of PKD. Also, there have been indi-viduals who were homozygous for the 1529A mutation.These individuals had a very severe form of PKD. There-fore, it is thought that the 1456T mutation is associatedwith a milder form of the disease and the 1529A mutationis associated with a more severe form of the disease. It isnot known how these mutations affect the severity of PKDwhen paired with different mutations.\\nSymptoms of PKD are similar to those symptoms\\nseen in individuals who have long-term hemolytic ane-\\nmia.

Because of this, individuals with PKD willhave hemolytic anemia. Additionally, the anemia or othersymptoms of PKD may worsen during a sudden illnessor pregnancy.\\nDiagnosis\\nA diagnosis of PKD can be made by measuring the\\namount of pyruvate kinase in red blood cells. Individualswith PKD tend to have 5–25% of the normal amount ofpyruvate kinase. Carriers of PKD also can have lesspyruvate kinase in their red blood cells, approximately40–60% of the normal value. However, there is an over-lap between the normal range of pyruvate kinase and theranges seen with carriers of PKD. Therefore, measuringthe amount of pyruvate kinase in the red blood cells isnot a good method of detecting carriers of PKD. If themutations causing PKD in a family are known, it may bepossible to perform mutation analysis to determine carri-er status of an individual and to help diagnose individu-als with PKD.\\nTreatment\\nIn the severest cases, individuals with PKD will\\nrequire multiple blood transfusions. In some of those cases,the spleen may be removed ( splenectomy ). Red blood cells\\nare normally removed from circulation by the spleen. Byremoving an individual’s spleen (usually a child), the redblood cells are allowed to stay in circulation longer thannormal; thereby, reducing the severity of the anemia. After\\na splenectomy, or once an individual with PKD is older, thenumber of transfusions tends to decrease.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis of PKD is extremely variable. Early\\nintervention and treatment of symptoms frequentlyimproves the individual’s health. Without treatment, indi-viduals may experience severe complications that maybecome lethal.

In sheep and cattle, for example, the bacteria tends toaccumulate in large numbers in the female’s uterus (theorgan where lambs and calves develop) and udder. Otheranimals have similar patterns of bacterial accumulationwithin the females. As a result, C. burnetii can cause infec-\\ntion through contaminated milk, or when humans comeinto contact with the fluids or tissues produced when a cowor sheep gives birth. Also, the bacteria can survive in drydust for months; therefore, if the female’s fluids contami-nate the ground, humans may become infected when theycome in contact with the contaminated dust.\\nPersons most at risk for Q fever include anybody\\nwho works with cattle or sheep, or products producedfrom them. These include farm workers, slaughterhouseworkers, workers in meat-packing plants, veterinarians,and wool workers.\\nQ fever has been found all over the world, except in\\nsome areas of Scandinavia, Antarctica, and New Zealand.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nC. burnetii causes infection when a human breathes\\nin tiny droplets, or drinks milk, containing the bacteria.After three to 30 days, symptoms of the illness appear.\\nThe usual symptoms of Q fever include fever, chills,\\nheavy sweating, headache ,nausea and vomiting ,diar-\\nrhea ,fatigue , and cough . Also, a number of other prob-\\nlems may present themselves, including inflammation ofthe liver (hepatitis); inflammation of the sac containingthe heart ( pericarditis ); inflammation of the heart mus-\\ncle itself ( myocarditis ); inflammation of the coverings\\nof the brain and spinal cord, or of the brain itself (menin-goencephalitis); and pneumonia .\\nChronic Q fever occurs most frequently in patients\\nwith other medical problems, including diseased heartvalves, weakened immune systems, or kidney disease.Such patients usually have about a year’s worth of vaguesymptoms, including a low fever, enlargement of thespleen and/or liver, and fatigue. Testing almost alwaysreveals that these patients have inflammation of the lin-ing of the heart ( endocarditis ).\\nDiagnosis\\nQ fever is diagnosed by demonstrating that the\\npatient’s immune system is making increasing numbersof antibodies (special immune cells) against markers(antigens) that are found on C. burnetii .\\nTreatment\\nDoxycycline and quinolone antibiotics are effective\\nfor treatment of Q fever. Treatment usually lasts for twoweeks. Rifampin and doxycycline together are given forchronic Q fever. Chronic Q fever requires treatment for atleast three years.\\nPrognosis\\nDeath is rare from Q fever. Most people recover\\ncompletely, although some patients with endocarditis willrequire surgery to replace their damaged heart valves.\\nPrevention\\nQ fever can be prevented by the appropriate han-\\ndling of potentially infective substances. For example,milk should always be pasteurized, and people who workwith animals giving birth should carefully dispose of thetissues and fluids associated with birth. Industries whichprocess animal materials (meat, wool) should take care toprevent the contamination of dust within the plant.Q\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2797'),\n",

In China, qigong is used in conjunc-\\ntion with other medical therapies for many chronic con-ditions, including asthma ,allergies ,AIDS ,cancer ,\\nheadaches, hypertension , depression, mental illness,\\nstrokes, heart disease, and obesity .\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nQigong originated before recorded history. Scholars\\nestimate qigong to be 5000–7000 old years. Tracing theexact historical development of qigong is difficult,because it was passed down in secrecy among monks andteachers for many generations. Qigong survived throughmany years before paper was invented, and it also sur-vived the Cultural Revolutions in China of the 1960s and1970s, which banned many traditional practices.\\nQigong has influenced and been influenced by many\\nof the major strands of Chinese philosophy. The Taoistphilosophy states that the universe operates within laws ofbalance and harmony, and that people must live within therhythms of nature—ideas that pervade qigong. WhenBuddhism was brought from India to China around theseventh century \\nA.D.,yoga techniques and concepts of\\nmental and spiritual awareness were introduced to qigongmasters. The Confucian school was concerned with howpeople should live their daily lives, a concern of qigong aswell. The martial arts were highly influenced by qigong,and many of them, such as t’ai chi and kung fu, developeddirectly from it. Traditional Chinese medicine also\\nshares many of the central concepts of qigong, such as thepatterns of energy flow in the body. Acupuncture and\\nacupressure use the same points on the body that qigong\\nseeks to stimulate. In China, qigong masters have beenrenowned physicians and healers. Qigong is often pre-scribed by Chinese physicians as part of the treatment.\\nDue to the political isolation of China, many Chinese\\nconcepts have been shrouded from the Western world.Acupuncture was “discovered” by American doctors inthe 1970s, although it had been in use for thousands ofyears.

In 1988, the First World Conference forAcademic Exchange of Medical Qigong was held in Bei-jing, China, where many studies were presented to atten-dees from around the world. In 1990, Berkeley, Califor-nia, hosted the First International Congress of Qigong. Inthe past decade, more Americans have begun to discoverthe beneficial effects of qigong, which motivate an esti-mated 60 million Chinese to practice it every day.\\nBasic concepts\\nIn Chinese thought, qi, or chi, is the fundamental life\\nenergy of the universe. It is invisible but present in air,water, food and sunlight. In the body, qi is the unseenvital force that sustains life. We are all born with inherit-ed amounts of qi, and we also get acquired qi from thefood we eat and the air we breathe. In qigong, the breathis believed to account for the largest quantity of acquiredqi, because the body uses air more than any other sub-stance. The balance of our physical, mental, and emo-tional levels also affect qi levels in the body.\\nQi travels through the body along channels called\\nmeridians. There are 12 main meridians, corresponding tothe 12 principal organs as defined by the traditional Chi-nese system: the lung, large intestines, stomach, spleen,heart, small intestine, urinary bladder, kidney, liver, gall-bladder, pericardium, and the “triple warmer,” which rep-resents the entire torso region. Each organ has qi associat-ed with it, and each organ interacts with particular emo-tions on the mental level. Qigong techniques are designedto improve the balance and flow of energy throughout themeridians, and to increase the overall quantity and volumeof qi. In qigong philosophy, mind and body are not sepa-rated as they often are in Western medicine. In qigong, themind is present in all parts of the body, and the mind canbe used to move qi throughout the body.\\nYin and yang are also important concepts in qigong.\\nThe universe and the body can be described by these twoseparate but complementary principles, which are alwaysinteracting, opposing, and influencing each other. Onegoal of qigong is to balance yin and yang within thebody. Strong movements or techniques are balanced bysoft ones, leftward movements by rightward, internaltechniques by external ones, and so on.\\nPracticing qigong\\nThere are thousands of qigong exercises. The specif-\\nic ones used may vary depending on the teacher, school,and objective of the practitioner. Qigong is used forphysical fitness, as a martial art, and most frequently forhealth and healing. Internal qigong is performed by thosewishing to increase their own energy and health. Someqigong masters are renowned for being able to performexternal qigong, by which the energy from one person is\\npassed on to another for healing. This transfer may soundsuspect to Western logic, but in the world of qigong thereare some amazing accounts of healing and extraordinarycapabilities demonstrated by qigong masters. Qigongmasters generally have deep knowledge of the conceptsof Chinese medicine and healing. In China, there are hos-pitals that use medical qigong to heal patients, along withherbs, acupuncture, and other techniques. In these hospi-tals, qigong healers use external qigong and also designspecific internal qigong exercises for patients’ problems.\\nThere are basic components of internal qigong ses-\\nsions. All sessions require warm-up and concluding exer-cises. Qigong consists of postures, movements, breathingtechniques, and mental exercises. Postures may involvestanding, sitting, or lying down. Movements includestretches, slow motions, quick thrusts, jumping, and bend-ing. Postures and movements are designed to strengthen,stretch, and tone the body to improve the flow of energy.One sequence of postures and movements is known as the“Eight Figures for Every Day.” This sequence is designedto quickly and effectively work the entire body, and iscommonly performed daily by millions in China.\\nBreathing techniques include deep abdominal\\nbreathing, chest breathing, relaxed breathing, and hold-ing breaths. One breathing technique is called the “SixHealing Sounds.” This technique uses particular breath-ing sounds for each of six major organs. These soundsare believed to stimulate and heal the organs.\\nMeditations and mind exercises are used to enhance\\nthe mind and move qi throughout the body. These exer-cises are often visualizations that focus on different bodyparts, words, ideas, objects, or energy flowing along themeridians. One mental exercise is called the “InnerSmile,” during which the practitioner visualizes joyful,healing energy being sent sequentially to each organ inthe body. Another mental exercise is called the “Micro-scopic Orbit Meditation,” in which the practitionerintently meditates on increasing and connecting the flowof qi throughout major channels.\\nDiscipline is an important dimension of qigong.\\nExercises are meant to be performed every morning andevening. Sessions can take from 15 minutes to hours.Beginners are recommended to practice between 15–30minutes twice a day. Beginners may take classes once ortwice per week, with practice outside of class. Classesgenerally cost between $10–$20 per session.\\nPreparations\\nQigong should be practiced in a clean, pleasant envi-\\nronment, preferably outdoors in fresh air. Loose andcomfortable clothing is recommended. Jewelry should be\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2799Qigong'),\n",

Practitioners should not performqigong on either full or completely empty stomachs.Qigong should not be performed during extreme weath-er, which may have negative effects on the body’s energysystems. Menstruating and pregnant women should per-form only certain exercises.\\nSide effects\\nSide effects may occur during or after qigong exer-\\ncises for beginners, or for those performing exercisesincorrectly. Side effects may include dizziness ,dry\\nmouth ,fatigue , headaches, insomnia , rapid heartbeat,\\nshortness of breath , heaviness or numbness in areas of\\nthe body, emotional instability, anxiety , or decreased\\nconcentration. Side effects generally clear up with restand instruction from a knowledgeable teacher.\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nWestern medicine generally does not endorse any of\\nthe traditional Chinese healing systems that utilize theconcept of energy flow in the body, largely because thisenergy has yet to be isolated and measured scientifically.New research is being conducted using sophisticatedequipment that may verify the existence of energy chan-nels as defined by the Chinese system.

It isalmost exclusively transmitted through saliva from thebite of an infected animal. Another name for the disease ishydrophobia , which literally means “fear of water,” a\\nsymptom shared by half of all people infected with rabies.Other symptoms include fever , depression, confusion,\\npainful muscle spasms, sensitivity to touch, loud noise,and light, extreme thirst, painful swallowing, excessivesalivation, and loss of muscle tone. If rabies is not pre-vented by immunization, it is essentially always fatal.\\nDescription\\nWorldwide, approximately 15,000 cases of human\\nrabies continue to occur annually. Remarkably, althoughmore than one million persons in the United States arebitten each year by animals, on average, only one or twopersons die from the disease each year. Nevertheless,with the continued encroachment of humans on animalhabitats, both for housing and recreational purposes,rabies remains a public health concern.\\nBoth domestic and wild animals may transmit rabies.\\nWith the widespread vaccination of domesticated ani-\\nmals in the United States, dogs in particular, the numberof cases of rabies has significantly declined. In 1955domesticated animals, especially dogs, constituted 47%of the reported rabies cases. By 1994, fewer than 2% ofpositive tests occurred in dogs. In fact, in the 1990s, catsoutnumbered dogs as transmitters of the disease. As of1997, most cases of rabies are in wild animals, particular-ly bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, wolves, and coyotes.Anyone who has been bitten by an animal, regard-\\nless of age or sex, can contract rabies. However, peoplewhose occupations involve routine exposure to a domes-tic animal that has not been immunized or to wildlife areat a greater risk for getting the disease. As a result, caveexplorers, farm and ranch workers, animal trainers andcaretakers, forest rangers, animal exterminators, somelaboratory workers, and veterinarians are at a higher risk.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nRabies is caused by a rod- or bullet-shaped virus in\\nthe family Rhabdoviridae. The virus is usually transmit-ted via an animal bite, however, cases have also beenreported in which the virus penetrated the body throughinfected saliva, moist tissues such as the eyes or lips, ascratch on the skin, or the transplantation of infected tis-sues. Inhalation of the virus in the air, as might occur in ahighly populated bat cave, is also thought to occur.\\nFrom the bite or other area of penetration, the virus\\nmultiplies as it spreads along nerves that travel awayfrom the spinal cord and brain (efferent nerves) and intothe salivary glands. The rabies virus may lie dormant inthe body for several weeks or months, but rarely muchlonger, before symptoms appear. Initially, the areaaround the bite may burn and be painful. Early symp-toms may also include a sore throat , low-grade fever,\\nheadache , loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting , and\\ndiarrhea . Painful spasms develop in the muscles that\\ncontrol breathing and swallowing. The individual maybegin to drool thick saliva and may have dilated or irreg-ular pupils, increased tears and perspiration, and lowblood pressure.\\nLater, as the disease progresses, the patient becomes\\nagitated and combative and may exhibit increased mentalconfusion. The affected person usually becomes sensitiveto touch, loud noises, and bright lights. The victim alsobecomes extremely thirsty, but is unable to drink becauseswallowing is painful. Some patients begin to dread waterbecause of the painful spasms that occur. Other severeR\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2801'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 507}, page_content='symptoms during the later stage of the disease include\\nexcessive salivation, dehydration , and loss of muscle\\ntone. Death usually occurs three to 20 days after symp-\\ntoms have developed. Unfortunately, recovery is very rare.\\nDiagnosis\\nAfter the onset of symptoms, blood tests and cere-\\nbrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis tests will be conducted.\\nCSF will be collected during a procedure called a lumbarpuncture in which a needle is used to withdraw a sampleof CSF from the area around the spinal cord. The CSFtests do not confirm diagnosis but are useful in ruling outother potential causes for the patient’s altered mental state.\\nThe two most common diagnostic tests are the fluo-\\nrescent antibody test and isolation of the rabies virus from\\nan individual’s saliva or throat culture . The fluorescent\\nantibody test involves taking a small sample of skin (biop-sy) from the back of the neck of the patient. If specific pro-teins, called antibodies, that are produced only in responseto the rabies virus are present, they will bind with the fluo-rescent dye and become visible. Another diagnostic proce-dure involves taking a corneal impression in which a swabor slide is pressed lightly against the cornea of the eye todetermine whether viral material is present.\\nTreatment\\nBecause of the extremely serious nature of a rabies\\ninfection, the need for rabies immunizations will be care-fully considered for anyone who has been bitten by ananimal, based on a personal history and results of diag-nostic tests.\\nIf necessary, treatment includes the following:\\n• The wound is washed thoroughly with medicinal soap\\nand water. Deep puncture wounds should be flushed\\nwith a catheter and soapy water. Unless absolutely nec-essary, a wound should not be sutured.\\n• Tetanus toxoid and antibiotics will usually be adminis-\\ntered.\\n• Rabies vaccination may or not be given, based on the\\navailable information. If the individual was bitten by adomestic animal and the animal was captured, the ani-mal will be placed under observation in quarantine forten days. If the animal does not develop rabies withinfour to seven days, then no immunizations are required.If the animal is suspected of being rabid, it is killed, andthe brain is examined for evidence of rabies infection.In cases involving bites from domestic animals wherethe animal is not available for examination, the decisionfor vaccination is made based on the prevalence ofrabies within the region where the bite occurred. If thebite was from a wild animal and the animal was cap-\\ntured, it is generally killed because the incubation peri-od of rabies is unknown in most wild animals.\\n• If necessary, the patient is vaccinated immediately, gen-\\nerally through the administration of human rabiesimmune globulin (HRIG) for passive immunization,followed by human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) orrabies vaccine adsorbed (RV A) for active immuniza-tion. Passive immunization is designed to provide theindividual with antibodies from an already immunizedindividual, while active immunization involves stimu-lating the individual’s own immune system to produceantibodies against the rabies virus. Both rabies vaccinesare equally effective and carry a lower risk of sideeffects than some earlier treatments. Unfortunately,however, in underdeveloped countries, these newer vac-cines are usually not available. Antibodies are adminis-tered to the patient in a process called passive immu-nization. To do this, the HRIG vaccine is administeredonce, at the beginning of treatment. Half of the dose isgiven around the bite area, and the rest is given in themuscle. Inactivated viral material (antigenic) is thengiven to stimulate the patient’s own immune system toproduce antibodies against rabies. For active immuniza-tion, either the HDCV or RV A vaccine is given in aseries of five injections. Immunizations are typicallygiven on days one, three, seven, 14, and 28.\\nIn those rare instances in which rabies has pro-\\ngressed beyond the point where immunization would beeffective, the patient will be given medication to preventseizures, relieve some of the anxiety , and relieve painful\\nmuscle spasms. Pain relievers will also be given. In the\\nlater stages, aggressive supportive care will be providedto maintain breathing and heart function. Survival is rarebut can occur.\\nPrognosis\\nIf preventative treatment is sought promptly, rabies\\nneed not be fatal. Immunization is almost always effec-tive if started within two days of the bite. Chance ofeffectiveness declines, however, the longer vaccination isput off. It is, however, important to start immunizations,even if it has been weeks or months following a suspect-ed rabid animal bite, because the vaccine can be effectiveeven in these cases. If immunizations do not prove effec-tive or are not received, rabies is nearly always fatal witha few days of the onset of symptoms.\\nPrevention\\nThe following precautions should be observed in\\nenvironments where humans and animals may likelycome into contact.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2802Rabies'),\n",

It works by\\nchanging the shape of the cornea—the transparent part ofthe eye that covers the iris and the pupil.\\nPurpose\\nAbout 25–30% of all people in the world are near-\\nsighted and need eyeglasses or contact lenses for dis-tance vision to be clear. For a number of reasons, somepeople don’t like wearing corrective lenses. Some feelunattractive in eyeglasses. Others worry about not beingable to see without their glasses in an emergency, such asa house fire or a burglary. Both glasses and contact lensescan be scratched, broken, or lost. In addition, contactlenses require special care and can irritate the eyes.\\nRadial keratotomy was introduced in North America\\nin 1978. Since then doctors have improved the technique,and its results have become more predictable.

It is most successful in patients with alow to moderate amount of nearsightedness—peoplewhose eyes require up to -5.00 diopters of correction. Adiopter (D) is a unit of measure of focusing power.Minus lenses correct nearsightedness.\\nPrecautions\\nNot every nearsighted person is a good candidate for\\nradial keratotomy. This type of surgery cannot help peo-ple whose nearsightedness is caused by keratoconus, arare condition in which the cornea is cone shaped. Theprocedure usually is not done on patients under 18,because their eyes are still growing and changing shape. Itis important that visual status is stable. Women who arepregnant, have just given birth, or are breast-feedingshould not have the surgery because hormonal changesmay cause temporary changes in the cornea. In addition,anyone with glaucoma or with any disease that interferes\\nwith healing (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis , lupus erythe-\\nmatosus, or uncontrolled diabetes) should not have RK.\\nRadial keratotomy weakens the cornea, making it\\nvulnerable to injuries even long after the surgery. Gettinghit in the head after having RK can cause the cornea totear and can lead to blindness. For this reason, the proce-dure is not recommended for people who engage insports that could result in a blow to the head (i.e., karateor racquetball).\\nIt is important to keep in mind that RK is a perma-\\nnent procedure and that success cannot be guaranteed.An experienced eye surgeon can estimate how likely it isthat the surgery will help a particular patient, but that isjust an estimate. There is no way to know for surewhether the surgery will improve eyesight enough toeliminate the need for corrective lenses. Vision usuallyimproves after RK, but it is not always perfect. Anyonewho decides to have RK should be prepared to acceptless-than-perfect vision after surgery, which may neces-sitate the continued use of glasses or contact lenses. Thissurgery does not eliminate the need for reading glasses.Actually, someone who didn’t need reading glassesbefore surgery because their myopia allowed near visionto be clear may find themselves needing reading glasses.Patients must ask about this prior to surgery.\\nAnyone considering RK should also be aware that\\ncertain professions, including branches of the military,are not open to people who have had the procedure.\\nA reputable ophthalmologist will discuss the risks of\\nthe procedure and should tell anyone considering it thatperfect vision can’t be guaranteed. Patients should be waryof any doctor who tries too hard to “sell” them on RK.Description\\nIn a person with clear vision, light passes through\\nthe cornea and the lens of the eye and focuses on a mem-brane lining the back of the eye called the retina. In aperson with myopia, the eyeball is usually too long, solight focuses in front of the retina. Radial keratotomyreduces myopia by flattening the cornea. This reducesthe focusing power of the cornea allowing light to focusfurther back onto the retina (or at least closer to it), form-ing a clearer image.\\nA surgeon performing RK uses a very small dia-\\nmond-blade knife to makes four to eight radial incisionsaround the edge of the cornea. These slits are made in apattern that resembles the spokes of wheel. As the corneaheals, its center flattens out.\\nRadial keratotomy is usually performed in an oph-\\nthalmologist’s office. Before the surgery begins, thepatient may be given medicine to help him or her relax. Alocal anesthetic—usually in the form of eye drops—isused to numb the eye, but the patient remains consciousduring the procedure. The surgeon looks through a surgi-cal microscope while making the slits. The treatmentusually takes no more than 30 minutes.\\nSome ophthalmologists will perform RK on both\\neyes at once but others prefer to do one eye at a time. Itonce was thought that surgeons could use the results ofthe first eye to predict how the well the procedure wouldwork on the second eye. However, a study published in1997 found that this was not the case. The authors of thestudy cautioned that there might be other reasons not tooperate on both eyes at once, such as increased risk ofinfection and other complications.\\nThe cost for RK depends on the surgeon, but usually\\nranges from $1,000–$1,500 per eye. Medical insuranceusually does not cover RK, because it is considered anelective procedure—one that people choose to have done.\\nPreparation\\nBefore beginning the procedure, the surgeon marks\\nan area in the center of the cornea called the optical zone.This is the part of the cornea that one sees through (it’sthe area over the pupil). No cuts are made in this region.The surgeon also measures the cornea’s thickness, todecide how deep the slits should be.\\nAftercare\\nAfter the surgery is over, the anesthetic wears off.\\nSome patients feel slight pain and are given eye drops\\nand medications to relieve their discomfort. For severaldays after the surgery, the eye that was treated may feel\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2804Radial keratotomy'),\n",

The eye may also\\nwater, burn slightly, and be sensitive to light.\\nAs with any type of surgery, it is important to guard\\nagainst infection. Patients are given eye drops to protectagainst infection and may be told to use them for severalweeks after the surgery. Because RK weakens the corneait is important to protect the head and eyes.\\nThe cornea heals slowly, and full recovery can take\\nseveral months (another reason not to have the surgerydone on both eyes at the same time). While the cornea ishealing, patients may experience these problems:\\n• Variations in vision. Eyesight may be better in the\\nmorning than in the evening or vice versa.\\n• Temporary pain.• Increased glare.• Starburst or halo effects. Rays or rings of light around\\nlights at night.\\n• Hyperopic shift. As the cornea flattens, vision may\\nbecome more farsighted (hyperopic). For this reason,the surgeon may initially undercorrect the patient. Thisgradual shift may occur over several years.If RK does not completely correct a person’s near-\\nsightedness, glasses or contact lenses may be needed. Ingeneral, people who were able to wear contact lensesbefore the procedure can still wear them afterward. Evenpatients whose nearsightedness was corrected may stillneed glasses for reading. This is especially true for mid-dle-aged and older patients. The lens of the eye stiffenswith age, making reading glasses necessary ( presby-\\nopia). Radial keratotomy does not correct this problem.\\nThe surgeon who performs the RK procedure will\\ntell the patient how often to return for follow-up visits.Often, two to four visits are needed, including one theday after surgery. It is also important to know what sideeffects should be reported immediately to the surgeon(e.g., pain or nausea).\\nRisks\\nComplications from RK are rare, but they can occur.\\nThese include:\\n• cataract, (a clouding of the lens of the eye, resulting in\\npartial or total loss of vision)\\n• serious infection\\n• lasting pain\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2805Radial keratotomy\\nRadial keratotomy scars on the cornea of an eye.

A major study by the National Eye Insti-tute, reported in 1994, tracked the success of RK in 374patients who had had the procedure done 10 years earlier.The study found that:\\n• 85% had at least 20/40 vision (the acuity considered\\ngood enough to drive without glasses)\\n• 70% did not need glasses or contact lenses for distance\\nvision\\n• 53% had 20/20 vision without glasses\\n• 30% still needed glasses or contact lenses to see clearly• 1–3% had worse vision than before they had RK• 40% had a hyperopic shift\\nAs with all surgeries, RK has risks. These risks\\ninclude having worse vision than before the surgery;halos; glare; and although rare, blindness. Some afteref-fects, such as halos or glare may last for years. Otherrefractive surgeries, such as photorefractive keratectomy(PRK) and laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK)use lasers to change the shape of the cornea and they mayproduce fewer side effects. It is important to speak withan experienced eye surgeon who has done many refrac-tive surgeries to fully understand the options and risksinvolved before making a decision.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nBrink, Susan. “Sculptors of Better Vision.” U.S. News & World\\nReport 118 (22 May 1995): 66+.\\nHarding, Anne. “A Closer Look at Eye Surgery.” Harvard\\nHealth Letter 21 (June 1996): 4+.\\nSegal, Marian. “Eye Surgery Helps Some See Better.” FDA\\nConsumer 29 (July/Aug. 1995): 15+.\\nORGANIZATIONS\\nAmerican Academy of Ophthalmology. 655 Beach Street, P.O.\\nBox 7424, San Francisco, CA 94120-7424. <http://www.eyenet.org>.\\nAmerican Optometric Association. 243 North Lindbergh Blvd.,\\nSt. Louis, MO 63141.

These waves all travel at the speed of light,and unlike sound they can all travel through empty space.The frequencies above visible light have enough energyto penetrate and cause damage to living tissue, damagethat can be as minor as a sunburn caused by ultraviolet\\nlight or as extreme as the incineration of Hiroshima,Japan, during World War II. Lower frequencies do notpenetrate, but can cause eye and skin damage, primarilydue to the heat they transmit.\\nAtomic particles can also have enough energy to do\\ndamage. They come from radioactive isotopes as theydecay to stable elements. Electrons are called beta parti-cles when they radiate. Alpha particles are the nuclei ofhelium atoms—two protons and two neutrons—withoutthe surrounding electrons. Alpha particles are too large topenetrate a piece of paper unless they are greatly acceler-ated in electric and magnetic fields. Other subatomic par-ticles are much less common outside of nuclear reactorsand particle accelerators.\\nThe energy of electromagnetic radiation is a direct\\nfunction of its frequency. The high-energy, high-frequen-cy waves, which can penetrate solids to various depths,cause damage by separating molecules into electricallycharged pieces, a process known as ionization. Atomicparticles, cosmic rays, gamma rays, x rays, and someultraviolet are called ionizing radiation. The pieces theygenerate are called free radicals. They act like acid, butthey last only fractions of a second before they revert toharmless forms. Adjusting the energy of therapeutic radi-ation can select a depth at which it will do the most dam-age. Ionizing radiation also does damage to chromo-somes by breaking strands of DNA. DNA is so good atrepairing itself that both strands of the double helix mustbe broken to produce genetic damage.\\nBecause radiation is energy, it can be measured.\\nThere are a number of units used to quantify radiationenergy. Some refer to effects on air, others to effects onliving tissue. The roentgen, named after Wilhelm ConradRoentgen, who discovered x rays in 1895, measures ion-izing energy in air. A rad expresses the energy transferredto tissue. The rem measures tissue response. A roentgengenerates about a rad of effect and produces about a remof response. The gray and the sievert are internationalunits equivalent to 100 rads and rems, respectively. Acurie, named after French physicists who experimentedwith radiation, is a measure of actual radioactivity givenoff by a radioactive element, not a measure of its effect.The average annual human exposure to natural back-ground radiation is roughly 3 milliSieverts (mSv).\\nIt is reasonable to presume that any amount of ioniz-\\ning radiation will produce some damage. However, thereis radiation everywhere, from the sun (cosmic rays) and\\nfrom traces of radioactive elements in the air (radon) andthe ground (uranium, radium, carbon-14, potassium-40and many others). Earth’s atmosphere protects us frommost of the sun’s radiation. Living at 5,000 feet altitudein Denver, Colorado, doubles exposure to radiation, andflight in a commercial airliner increases it 150-fold bylifting us above 80% of that atmosphere. Because noamount of radiation is perfectly safe and because radia-tion is ever present, arbitrary limits have been establishedto provide some measure of safety for those exposed tounusual amounts. Less than 1% of them reach the currentannual permissible maximum of 50 mSv.\\nOne of the most remarkable bits of information to\\ncome out of studies of Japanese people exposed to atom-ic bomb irradiation in 1945 is the absence of geneticdamage to survivors. Forty years of studying 76,000 chil-dren has detected no increase in abnormal pregnancies orchromosomes. This evidence suggests that it takes about1 Sv of gonad radiation to double human mutationscaused by background radiation, and that backgroundradiation causes less than 1% of these mutations. Otherorganisms are much more susceptible than humans tomutations from radiation.\\nIonizing radiation has many uses in medicine, both\\nin diagnosis and in treatment. X rays and CT scannersuse it to form images of the body’s insides. Nuclear med-icine uses radioactive isotopes to diagnose and to treatmedical conditions. In the body, radioactive elementslocalize to specific tissues and give off tiny amounts ofradiation. Detecting that radiation provides informationon both anatomy and function. Radioactive chemicals arealso used to treat certain conditions, most commonly anoveractive thyroid. Because the thyroid is the only glandin the body to utilize iodine, all iodine in the body is con-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2807Radiation injuries\\nThis person’s nose is inflamed and scaly due to radiation\\nexposure.

A radioactive isotope of iodine (I-131)\\nwill gradually destroy overactive thyroid tissue, curingthe disease. The dosage must be carefully measured andeven then sometimes does too good a job. Since it is easi-er to replace inadequate thyroid than to deal with toomuch, this treatment is very acceptable.\\nEarly workers with x rays frequently died from its long\\nterm effects, notably leukemia. Wrist watches used to glowin the dark due to radium that was painted on the dial andwatch hands. This work was done by workers who moist-ened their brushes with their tongues. Many of them devel-oped cancer of the tongue. After lessons like these, most\\nsources of man-made radioactivity have been eliminatedfrom the environment. Watches no longer glow in the darkfrom radium. Shoe salesmen no longer use fluoroscopes tocheck shoes for a proper fit. Today, doses used for medicalexaminations are ordinarily too small to be of concern.Methods of magnification, lead shielding, and a greaterawareness of the risks have all but eliminated the dangerfrom diagnostic radiation. It adds on average only 0.6 Sv ayear, or 20% of the background radiation. Nevertheless,people who work around x rays monitor their exposure,because there is no such thing as a completely safe dose.\\nIt is therapeutic, accidental, and deliberate radiation\\nthat does the obvious damage. There has not been muchin the way of deliberate radiation damage since Nagasa-ki, but accidental radiation exposure happens periodical-ly. Between 1945 and 1987, there were 285 nuclear reac-tor accidents, injuring over 1,550 people and killing 64.The most striking example, and the only one to endangerthe public, was the meltdown of the graphite core nuclearreactor at Chernobyl in 1986, which spread a cloud ofradioactive particles across the entire continent ofEurope. Information about radiation effects is still beinggathered from that disaster. There have also been a fewaccidents with medical and industrial radioactivity.\\nNevertheless, it is believed that radiation is responsi-\\nble for less than 1% of all human disease and for about3% of all cancers. This figure does not include lung can-cer from environmental radon, because that informationis unknown. The figure could be significant, but it isgreatly confounded by the similar effects of tobacco.\\nBecause cancers are usually faster growing than\\ntheir host tissues, they can be selectively killed by care-fully measured radiation. This is most true of the lym-phomas. Other cancers are less radiosensitive. Wheneverradiation is used to treat cancer, care must be taken tomeasure the dose carefully and aim it as accurately aspossibly. Even so, many cancers differ so little from thesurrounding tissue in their sensitivity that undesirabledamage is unavoidable. Skin will become thin makingthe blood vessels very visible. Bowels will become irri-tated and cause vomiting and diarrhea . Other organs\\nmay scar and decrease their function. Bone marrow isalways at risk of damage. Fortunately, the bone marrowis so widely spread throughout the body that localizedtreatment damages only a part of it. A typical therapeuticdose of radiation to a localized area is about 2 Gy (grays)per day, repeated at intervals to a total dose that varieswith the type of cancer being treated.\\nNewer techniques of directing radiation are provid-\\ning greater safety for equivalent tumor doses of radiation.One method uses several different beams of radiation sothat only the point of their convergence receives the fulldose. A gamma knife is a new surgical tool that focusesradiation with extreme accuracy in three dimensions,sparing closely surrounding tissue from the radiationeffects. It focuses 201 Cobalt-60 or linear acceleratorsources without need for a surgical incision.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nRadiation can damage every tissue in the body. The\\nparticular manifestation will depend upon the amount ofradiation, the time over which it is absorbed, and the sus-ceptibility of the tissue. The fastest growing tissues arethe most vulnerable, because radiation as much as triplesits effects during the growth phase. Bone marrow cellsthat make blood are the fastest growing cells in the body.A fetus in the womb is equally sensitive. The germinalcells in the testes and ovaries are only slightly less sensi-tive. Both can be rendered useless with very small dosesof radiation. More resistant are the lining cells of thebody—skin and intestines. Most resistant are the braincells, because they grow the slowest.\\nThe relative sensitivity of various tissues gives a\\ngood idea of the wide range that presents itself. The num-bers represent the minimum damaging doses; a gray and asievert represent roughly the same amount of radiation:\\n• fetus—2 grays (Gy)\\n• bone marrow—2 Gy\\n• ovary—2–3 Gy\\n• testes—5–15 Gy\\n• lens of the eye—5 Gy\\n• child cartilage—10 Gy\\n• adult cartilage—60 Gy\\n• child bone—20 Gy\\n• adult bone—60 Gy\\n• kidney—23 Gy\\n• child muscle—20-30 Gy\\n• adult muscle—100+ Gy\\n• intestines—45–55 Gy\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2808Radiation injuries'),\n",

Over time the accumulating damage, ifnot enough to kill cells outright, distorts their growth andcauses scarring and/or cancers. In addition to leukemias,cancers of the thyroid, brain, bone, breast, skin, stomach,and lung all arise after radiation. Damage depends, too,on the ability of the tissue to repair itself. Some tissuesand some types of damage produce much greater conse-quences than others.\\nImmediately after sudden irradiation, the fate of the\\npatient depends mostly on the total dose absorbed. Thisinformation comes mostly from survivors of the atomicbomb blasts over Japan in 1945.\\n• Massive doses incinerate immediately and are not dis-\\ntinguishable from the heat of the source.\\n• A sudden whole body dose over 50 Sv produces such\\nprofound neurological, heart, and circulatory damagethat patients die within the first two days.\\n• Doses in the 10–20 Sv range affect the intestines,\\nstripping their lining and leading to death within\\nthree months from vomiting, diarrhea, starvation , and\\ninfection.\\n• Victims receiving 6–10 Sv all at once usually escape an\\nintestinal death, facing instead bone marrow failure anddeath within two months from loss of blood coagula-tion factors and the protection against infection provid-ed by white blood cells.\\n• Between 2–6 Sv gives a fighting chance for survival if\\nvictims are supported with blood transfusions andantibiotics .\\n• One or two Sv produces a brief, non-lethal sickness\\nwith vomiting, loss of appetite, and generalized dis-comfort.\\nTreatment\\nIt is clearly important to have some idea of the dose\\nreceived as early as possible, so that attention can bedirected to those victims in the 2–10 Sv range that mightsurvive with treatment. Blood transfusions, protectionfrom infection in damaged organs, and possibly the useof newer stimulants to blood formation can save manyvictims in this category.\\nLocal radiation exposures usually damage the skin\\nand require careful wound care, removal of dead tissue,and skin grafting if the area is large.

Radiation therapy is a common form of can-cer therapy. It is used in more than half of all cancercases. Radiation therapy can be used:\\n• alone to kill cancer• before surgery to shrink a tumor and make it easier to\\nremove\\n• during surgery to kill cancer cells that may remain in\\nsurrounding tissue after the surgery (called intraopera-tive radiation)\\n• after surgery to kill cancer cells remaining in the body• to shrink an inoperable tumor in order to and reduce\\npain and improve quality of life\\n• in combination with chemotherapy\\nFor some kinds of cancers such as early-stage\\nHodgkin’s disease, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and cer-tain types of prostate, or brain cancer, radiation therapyalone may cure the disease. In other cases, radiation ther-apy used in conjunction with surgery, chemotherapy, orboth, increases survival rates over any of these therapiesused alone.\\nPrecautions\\nRadiation therapy does not make the person having\\nthe treatments radioactive. In almost all cases, the bene-fits of this therapy outweigh the risks. However radiationtherapy can have has serious consequences, so anyonecontemplating it should be sure understand why the treat-ment team believes it is the best possible treatmentoption for their cancer. Radiation therapy is often notappropriate for pregnant women, because the radiationcan damage the cells of the developing baby. Womenwho think they might be pregnant should discuss thiswith their doctor.\\nDescription\\nRadiation therapy is a local treatment. It is painless.\\nThe radiation acts only on the part of the body that isexposed to the radiation. This is very different fromchemotherapy in which drugs circulate throughout thewhole body. There are two main types of radiation thera-py. In external radiation therapy a beam of radiation isdirected from outside the body at the cancer. In internalradiation therapy, called brachytherapy or implant thera-py, where a source of radioactivity is surgically placedinside the body near the cancer.\\nHow radiation therapy works\\nThe protein that carries the code controlling most\\nactivities in the cell is called deoxyribonucleic acid orDNA. When a cell divides, its DNA must also double anddivide. High-energy radiation kills cells by damagingtheir DNA, thus blocking their ability to grow andincrease in number.\\nOne of the characteristics of cancer cells is that they\\ngrow and divide faster than normal cells. This makesthem particularly vulnerable to radiation. Radiation alsodamages normal cells, but because normal cells aregrowing more slowly, they are better able to repair radia-tion damage than are cancer cells. In order to give normalcells time to heal and reduce side effects, radiation treat-ments are often given in small doses over a six or sevenweek period.\\nExternal radiation therapy\\nExternal radiation therapy is the most common kind of\\nradiation therapy. It is usually done during outpatient visitsto a hospital clinic and is usually covered by insurance.\\nOnce a doctor, called a radiation oncologist, deter-\\nmines the proper dose of radiation for a particular cancer,the dose is divided into smaller doses called fractions.One fraction is usually given each day, five days a weekfor six to seven weeks. However, each radiation plan isindividualized depending on the type and location of thecancer and what other treatments are also being used.The actual administration of the therapy usually takes\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2810Radiation therapy'),\n",

Itis important to attend every scheduled treatment to getthe most benefit from radiation therapy.\\nRecently, trials have begun to determine if there are\\nways to deliver radiation fractions so that they kill morecancer cells or have fewer side effects. Some trials usesmaller doses given more often. Up-to-date informationon voluntary participation in clinical trials and wherethey are being held is available by entering the searchterm “radiation therapy” at the following web sites:\\n• National Cancer Institute. <http://cancertrials.nci.nih.\\ngov> or (800) 4-CANCER.\\n• National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials. <http://\\nclinicaltrials.gov>.\\n• Center Watch: A Clinical Trials Listing. <http://www.\\ncenterwatch.com>.\\nThe type of machines used to administer external\\nradiation therapy and the material that provides the radia-tion vary depending on the type and location of the can-cer. Generally, the patient puts on a hospital gown and liesdown or sits in a special chair. Parts of the body notreceiving radiation are covered with special shields thatblock the rays. A technician then directs a beam of radia-tion to a pre-determined spot on the body where the can-cer is located. The patient must stay still during theadministration of the radiation so that no other parts of thebody are affected. As an extra precaution in some treat-ments, special molds are made to make sure the body is inthe same position for each treatment. However, the treat-ment itself is painless, like having a bone x-rayed.\\nInternal radiation therapy\\nInternal radiation therapy is called brachytherapy,\\nimplant therapy, interstitial radiation, or intracavitaryradiation. With internal radiation therapy, a bit ofradioactive material is sealed in an implant (sometimescalled a seed or capsule). The implant is then placed veryclose to the cancer. The advantage of internal radiationtherapy is that it concentrates the radiation near the can-cer and lessens the chance of damage to normal cells.Many different types of radioactive materials can be usedin the implant, including cesium, iridium, iodine, phos-phorus, and palladium.\\nHow the implant is put near the cancer depends on\\nthe size and location of the cancer. Internal radiationtherapy is used for some cancers of the head, neck, thy-roid, breast, female reproductive system, and prostate.Most people will have the radioactive capsule implantedby a surgeon while under either general or local anesthe-sia at a hospital or surgical clinic.Patients receiving internal radiation therapy do\\nbecome temporarily radioactive. They must remain in thehospital during the time that the implant stays in place.The length of time is determined by the type of cancerand the dose of radioactivity to be delivered. During thetime the implant is in place, the patient will have to stayin bed and remain reasonably still.\\nWhile the implant is in place, the patient’s contact\\nwith other people will be limited. Healthcare workerswill make their visits as brief as possible to avoid expo-sure to radiation, and visitors, especially children andpregnant women, will be limited.\\nThe implant usually can be removed in a simple pro-\\ncedure without an anesthetic. As soon as the implant isout of the body, the patient is no longer radioactive, andrestrictions on being with other people are lifted. Gener-ally people can return to a level of activity that feels com-fortable to them as soon as the implant is removed. Occa-sionally the site of the implant is sore for some timeafterwards. This discomfort may limit specific activities.\\nIn some cases, an implant is left permanently inside\\nthe body. People who have permanent implants need tostay in the hospital and away from other people for thefirst few days. Gradually the radioactivity of the implantdecreases, and it is safe to be around other people.\\nRadioimmunotherapy\\nRadioimmunotherapy is a promising way to treat\\ncancer that has spread (metastasized) to multiple loca-tions throughout the body. Antibodies are immune systemproteins that specifically recognize and bind to only onetype of cell. They can be designed to bind only with a cer-tain type of cancer cell. To carry out radioimmunotherapy,antibodies with the ability to bind specifically to apatient’s cancer cells are attached to radioactive materialand injected into the patient’s bloodstream. When theseman-made antibodies find a cancer cell, they bind to it.Then the radiation kills the cancer cell. This process isstill experimental, but because it can be used to selective-ly attack only cancer cells, it holds promise for eliminat-ing cancers that have spread beyond the primary tumor.\\nRadiation used to treat cancer\\nPHOTON RADIATION. Early radiation therapy used x\\nrays like those used to take pictures of bones,or gammarays. X rays and gamma rays are high energy rays com-posed of massless particles of energy (like light) calledphotons. The distinction between the two is that gammarays originate from the decay of radioacive substances(like radium and cobalt-60), while x rays are generated bydevices that excite electrons (such as cathode ray tubesand linear accelerators). These high energy rays act on\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2811Radiation therapy'),\n",

Particle radiation is radiation\\ndelivered by particles that have mass. Proton therapy hasbeen used since the early 1990s. Proton rays consist ofprotons, a type of positively charged atomic particle,rather than photons, which have neither mass nor charge.Like x rays and gamma rays, proton rays disrupt cellularactivity. The advantage of using proton rays is that theycan be shaped to conform to the irregular shape of thetumor more precisely than x rays and gamma rays. Theyallow delivery of higher radiation doses to tumors with-out increasing damage to the surrounding tissue.\\nNeutron therapy is another type of particle radiation.\\nNeutron rays are very high-energy rays. They are com-posed of neutrons, which are particles with mass but nocharge. The type of damage they cause to cells is muchless likely to be repaired than that caused by x rays,gamma rays, or proton rays.\\nNeutron therapy can treat larger tumors than con-\\nventional radiation therapy. Conventional radiationtherapy depends on the presence of oxygen to work.The center of large tumors lack sufficient oxygen to besusceptible to damage from conventional radiation.Neutron radiation works in the absence of oxygen,making it especially effective for the treatment of inop-erable salivary gland tumors, bone cancers, and somekinds of advanced cancers of the pancreas, bladder,lung, prostate, and uterus.\\nPreparation\\nBefore radiation therapy, the size and location of the\\npatient’s tumor are determined very precisely using mag-netic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or computed tomog-raphy scans (CT scans). The correct radiation dose, thenumber of sessions, the interval between sessions, andthe method of application are calculated by a radiationoncologist based on the tumor type, its size, and the sen-sitivity of the nearby tissues.\\nThe patient’s skin is be marked with a semi-perma-\\nnent ink to help the radiation technologist achieve correctpositioning for each treatment. Molds may be built tohold tissues in exactly the right place each time.\\nAftercare\\nMany patients experience skin burn, fatigue, nausea,\\nand vomiting after radiation therapy regardless of thewhere radiation is applied. After treatment, the skinaround the site of the treatment may also become sore.Affected skin should be kept clean and can be treatedlike sunburn, with skin lotion or vitamin A and D oint-\\nment. Patients should avoid perfume and scented skinproducts and protect affected areas from the sun.\\nNausea and vomiting are most likely to occur when\\nthe radiation dose is high or if the abdomen or anotherpart of the digestive tract is irradiated. Sometimes nauseaand vomiting occur after radiation to other regions, but inthese cases the symptoms usually disappear within a fewhours after treatment. Nausea and vomiting can be treat-ed with antacids, Compazine, Tigan, or Zofran.\\nFatigue frequently starts after the second week of\\ntherapy and may continue until about two weeks after thetherapy is finished. Patients may need to limit their activ-ities, take naps, and get extra sleep at night.\\nPatients should see their oncologist (cancer doctor) at\\nleast once within the first few weeks after their final radi-ation treatment. They should also see an oncologist everysix to twelve months for the rest of their lives so they canbe checked to see if the tumor has reappeared or spread.\\nRisks\\nRadiation therapy can cause anemia, nausea, vomit-\\ning, diarrhea, hair loss, skin burn, sterility, and rarelydeath. However, the benefits of radiation therapy almostalways exceed the risks. Patients should discuss the riskswith their doctor and get a second opinion about theirtreatment plan.\\nNormal results\\nThe outcome of radiation treatment varies depending\\non the type, location, and stage of the cancer. For somecancers such as Hodgkin’s disease, about 75% of thepatients are cured. Prostate cancer also responds well toradiation therapy. Radiation to painful bony metastases isusually a dramatically effective form of pain control. Othercancers may be less sensitive to the benefits of radiation.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCukier, Daniel, and Virginia McCullough. Coping with Radia-\\ntion Therapy: A Ray of Hope.

In these cases, the surgery will not effectively con-tain the cancer.\\nDescription\\nCancers of the head and neck (sometimes inaccu-\\nrately called throat cancer) often spread to nearby tissuesand into the lymph nodes. Removing these structures isone way of controlling the cancer.\\nOf the 600 lymph nodes in the body, about 200 are in\\nthe neck. Only a small number of these are removed dur-ing a neck dissection. In addition, other structures such asmuscles, veins, and nerves may be removed during a radi-cal neck dissection. These include the sternocleidomas-toid muscle (one of the muscles that functions to flex thehead), internal jugular (neck) vein, submandibular gland(one of the salivary glands), and the spinal accessorynerve (a nerve that helps control speech, swallowing andcertain movements of the head and neck). The goal isalways to remove all the cancer but to save as many com-ponents surrounding the nodes as possible.\\nRadical neck dissections are done in a hospital under\\ngeneral anesthesia by a head and neck surgeon.

The patient should tell the anesthesiologist aboutall drug allergies and all medication (prescription, non-pre-\\nscription, or herbal) that he or she is taking.\\nAftercare\\nA person who has had a radical neck dissection will\\nstay in the hospital several days after the operation, andsometimes longer if surgery to remove the primary tumor\\nwas done at the same time. Drains are inserted under theskin to remove the fluid that accumulates in the neck area.Once the drains are removed and the incision appears tobe healing well, patients are usually discharged from thehospital, but will require follow-up doctor visits.

During the period of greatestradioactivity (24–72 hours), health care providers willlimit the amount of time spent with the patient to thatrequired for essential care.Description\\nInterstitial radiation therapy places the sources of\\nradiation directly into the tumor and surrounding struc-tures. Most commonly used in tumors of the head, neck,prostate, and breast, it may also be used in combinationwith external radiation therapy. The implant may be per-manent or removable. A permanent implant of radioac-tive seeds, such as gold or iodine, is placed directly intothe organ. Over several weeks or months, the seeds slow-ly deliver radiation to the tumor. More commonly used isthe removable implant that requires an operation undergeneral anesthesia to place narrow, hollow stainless steelneedles through the tumor. Teflon tubes are insertedthrough the needles, and the needles are then removed.After the patient returns to his room, radioactive seedsare inserted into the tubes in a procedure called afterload-ing. Once the desired dosage is reached, the tubes andseeds are removed.\\nIntracavity radiation is often used for gynecologic\\ncancers. Under general or spinal anesthesia, hollowapplicators are placed directly inside the affected organ.Correct positioning is confirmed by x rays, and once thepatient has returned to her room, a small plastic tubecontaining the radioactive isotope is inserted into thehollow applicator. The treatment is delivered over48–72 hours, after which time the applicator andradioactive sources are removed. Very high doses ofradiation can be delivered to the tumor, while the rapidremoval of the radioactive dose limits damage to thesurrounding structures.\\nAbnormal results\\nNormal cells are subjected to the effects of radiation;\\nany tissue near the radiation site may be damaged ordestroyed. Some side effects are acute and temporary,while others develop over time and may be permanent.Skin reactions, such as redness, itching , flaking, or strip-\\nping of the top layer, are usually temporary; long-termeffects can include scarring, and changes in texture. Radi-ation recall is a delayed skin side effect in which the areathat had been exposed to radiation becomes irritated orblistered after the patient receives certain chemotherapy .\\nFollowing treatment for tumors of the head and neck\\nregion, the lining of the mouth and throat can becomeinflamed or irritated, resulting in a condition known asmucositis or stomatitis . Injury to the salivary glands can\\ndecrease saliva production, resulting in a conditionknown as xerostomia, or dry mouth .

Sexual abuse includes acts inwhich an individual is forced to engage in sexual activityby use of threats or other fear tactics, or instances in whichan individual is physically unable to decline. Aggravatedsexual abuse occurs when an individual is forced to submitto sexual acts by use of physical force; threats of death ,\\ninjury, or kidnapping; or substances that render that indi-vidual unconscious or impaired.\\nDescription\\nMany misconceptions exist about rape and sexual\\nassault. It is often assumed that rape victims are allwomen who have been attacked by a total stranger andforced into having sexual intercourse. In reality, sexualassault can take many forms—it may be violent or nonvi-olent; the victim may be male or female, child or adult;the offender may be a stranger, relative, friend, authorityfigure, or spouse.\\nThe number of sexual assaults reported depends on\\nhow those abuses are defined. The United States Codeuses two terms to distinguish between different sexualactivities:\\n• Sexual act: contact between penis and vagina or penis\\nand anus that involves penetration; contact between themouth and genitals or anus; penetration of the vagina oranus with an object; or direct touching (not throughclothing) of the genitals of an individual under the ageof 16.\\n• Sexual contact: intentional touching of the genitals,\\nbreasts, buttocks, anus, inner thigh, or groin with nosexual penetration.\\nNational statistics\\nThere were 89,167 forcible rapes reported to U.S.\\nlaw enforcement agencies in 1999. Sixty-four out ofevery 100,000 women were reported to be victims ofrape that year, down 5% from 1998 and 11% from 1995.The actual number of rapes and sexual assaults, however,is in reality much larger. The National Violence AgainstWomen Survey, jointly sponsored by the Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2816Rape and sexual assault'),\n",

The survey estimated that approximately17,722,672 women and 2,782,440 men in the UnitedStates have been raped or have had rape attempted as achild or adult, and that 302,091 women and 92,748 menwere raped in the 12 months prior to the study.\\nThere are numerous reasons why the majority of\\nsexual assaults are never reported. Often the victim fearsretaliation from the offender. He or she may be afraid offamily, friends, the community, or the media learningabout the offense. There may be a concern about beingjudged or blamed by others. The victim may think thatno one will believe the assault occurred.\\nTHE VICTIMS. The 2000 “Victim, Incident, and\\nOffender Characteristics,” published by the NationalCenter for Juvenile Justice (NCJJ), analyzed sexualassault data collected by law enforcement agencies overa five-year span. The following characteristics werefound to be significant among victims of sexual assault:\\n• Age: Over two-thirds of reported victims of sexual\\nassault were juveniles under the age of 18. Twelve to 18year olds represented the largest group of victims at33%; 20% were between the ages of six and 11; chil-dren less than five years old and adults between 18 and24 years of age each constituted 14% of victims; 12%were between the ages of 25 and 34; and 7% were overthe age of 34. Persons over the age of 54 represented1% of all victims. One out of every seven victims sur-veyed in the study were under the age of six.\\n• Gender: Females were more than six times more likely\\nto be a victim of sexual assault then males; more than86% of victims were females. The great majority (99%)of the victims of forcible rapes were women, while menconstituted the majority (54%) of the victims offorcible sodomy (oral or anal intercourse). Females aremost likely to be the victim of sexual assault at age 14,while males are at most risk at age four.\\n• Location: The residence of the victim was the most\\ncommonly noted location of sexual assault (70%).Other common locations included schools,hotels/motels, fields, woods, parking lots, roadways,and commercial/office buildings.\\n• Weapons: A personal weapon (hands, feet, or fists) was\\nused in 77% of cases. No weapon was noted in 14% ofassaults; other weapons (knifes, clubs, etc.) were usedin 6% of cases. Firearms were involved in only 2% ofassaults.THE OFFENDERS. Similar statistics were gathered by\\nthe NCJJ regarding the perpetrators of rape and sexualassault. These characteristics included:\\n• Age: Over 23% of offenders were under the age of 18;\\njuveniles were more likely to be perpetrators of forciblesodomy and fondling. The remaining 77% of offenderswere adults and were responsible for 67% of juvenilevictims. For younger juvenile victims (under the age of12), juvenile offenders were responsible for approxi-mately 40% of assaults.\\n• Gender: The great majority of all reported offenders\\nwere male (96%). The number of female offenders rosefor victims under the age of six (12%), in contrast to6% for victims aged six through 12, 3% for victimsaged 12 through 17, and 1% for adult victims.\\n• Relationship with offender: Approximately 59% of\\noffenders were acquaintances of their victims, com-pared to family members (27%) or strangers (14%).Family members were more likely to be perpetratorsagainst juveniles (34%) than against adults (12%). Incontrast, strangers accounted for 27% of adult victimsand 7% of juveniles.\\n• Past offenses: In 19% of juvenile cases, the victim was\\nnot the only individual to be assaulted by the offender,compared to only 4% of adult cases.\\nConsequences\\nVictims of sexual assault may sustain a range of\\ninjuries. The National Women’s Study, funded by theNational Institute of Drug Abuse, found that more than70% of rape victims report no physical injuries as aresult of their assault; only 4% sustain serious injuriesthat require hospitalization. At least 49% of victims,however, state that they feared severe injuries or deathduring their assault. Fatalities occur in approximately0.1% of rape cases.\\nSexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are a source\\nof concern for many victims of sexual assault. The mostcommonly transmitted diseases are gonorrhea (caused\\nby Neisseria gonorrhoeae) , chlamydia (caused by\\nChlamydia trachomatis) ,trichomoniasis (caused by Tri-\\nchomonas vaginalis) , and genital warts (caused by\\nhuman papillomavirus). Syphilis (caused by Treponema\\npallidum) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\\nare also noted among some sexual assault victims. Thetransmission rate of STDs is estimated to be between3.6% and 30% of rapes.\\nAccording to the National Women’s Study, approxi-\\nmately 5% of adult female rape victims become pregnantas a result of their assault, leading to 32,100 pregnanciesa year among women 18 years of age or older.

Also known as rape\\ntrauma syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder\\n(PTSD) is a mental health disorder that describes a rangeof symptoms often experienced by someone who hasundergone a severely traumatic event. Approximately 31%of rape victims develop PTSD as a result of their assault;victims are more than six times more likely to developPTSD than women who have not been victimized.\\nThe symptoms of PTSD include:\\n• recurrent memories or flashbacks of the incident\\n• nightmares\\n• insomnia\\n• mood swings\\n• difficulty concentrating\\n• panic attacks• emotional numbness\\n• depression\\n•anxiety\\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have\\nalso been noted to have increased risk for developingother mental health problems. Over those who have notbeen victimized, rape victims are:\\n• three times more likely to have a major depressive\\nepisode\\n• four times more likely to have contemplated suicide\\n• thirteen times more likely to develop alcohol dependen-\\ncy problems\\n• twenty-six times more likely to develop drug abuse\\nproblems\\nTreatment\\nOnce a victim of sexual assault reports the crime to\\nlocal authorities, calls a rape crisis hotline, or arrives atthe emergency room to be treated for injuries, a multidis-ciplinary team is often formed to address his or her phys-ical, psychological, and judicial needs. This team usuallyincludes law enforcement officers, physicians, nurses,mental health professionals, victim advocates, and/orprosecutors.\\nThe victim of sexual assault may continue to feel\\nfear and anxiety for some time after the incident, and insome instances this may significantly impact his or herpersonal or professional life. Follow-up counselingshould therefore be provided for the victim, particularlyif symptoms of PTSD become evident.Forensic medical examination\\nThe forensic medical examination is an invaluable\\ntool for collecting evidence against a perpetrator. Sincethe great majority of victims know their assailant, thepurpose of the medical examination is often not to estab-lish identity but to establish nonconsensual sexual con-tact. The Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner program is aneffective model that is used in many United States hospi-tals and clinics to collect and document evidence, evalu-ate and treat for STDs and pregnancy , and refer victims\\nto follow-up medical care and counseling. The “SexualAssault Nurse Examiner Development and OperationGuide,” prepared by the Sexual Assault Resource Ser-vice, describes the ideal protocol for collecting evidencefrom a sexual assault victim. This includes:\\n• performing the medical examination within 72 hours of\\nthe assault\\n• taking a history of the assault\\n• documenting the general health of the victim, including\\nmenstrual cycle, potential allergies , and pregnancy sta-\\ntus\\n• assessment for trauma and taking photographic evi-\\ndence of injuries\\n• taking fingernail clippings or scrapings• taking samples for sperm or seminal fluid• combing head/pubic hair for foreign hairs, fibers, and\\nother substances\\n• collection of bloody, torn, or stained clothing• taking samples for blood typing and DNA screening\\nPrevention\\nSTD Prevention\\nWhile the concern of sexual assault victims of con-\\ntracting an STD is often high, the actual risk of transmis-sion is relatively low; the CDC estimates that the risk ofcontracting gonorrhea from an offender is between 6%and 12%, chlamydia between 4% and 17%, syphilisbetween 0.5% and 3%, and HIV less than 1%.

The CDC recommends the following prophylacticregimen be provided for victims of sexual assaults inwhich vaginal, oral, or anal penetration took place:\\n• a single dose of ceftriaxone, an antibiotic effective\\nagainst Neisseria gonorrhoeae\\n• a single dose of metronidazole, an antibiotic effective\\nagainst Trichomonas vaginalis\\n• a single dose of azithromycin or doxycycline, antibi-\\notics effective against Chlamydia trachomatis\\n• inoculation with the post-exposure hepatitis B vaccine\\nIn some instances, cultures may be taken during the\\nmedical examination and at time points afterward to testfor gonorrhea or chlamydia. It is important that the vic-tim receive information regarding the symptoms of STDsand be counseled to return for further examination if anyof these symptoms occur.\\nPregnancy prevention\\nFemale victims at risk for becoming pregnant after\\nan assault should be counseled on the availability ofemergency contraception . According to the Food and\\nDrug Administration (FDA), emergency contraception isnot effective if there is no pregnancy but works to preventpregnancy from occurring by delaying or preventingovulation, by affecting the transport of sperm, and/or bythinning the inner layer of the uterus (endometrium) sothat implantation is prevented. It is therefore not a formof abortion.\\nA number of options are available for women if they\\nchoose to use emergency contraceptives to prevent preg-nancy following a sexual assault. The Yupze regimenuses two oral contraceptive pills that contain both of thehormones estrogen and progestin. The risk of pregnancyis reduced by 75% after use of the Yupze regimen, reduc-ing the average number of pregnancies after unprotectedsex from eight in 100 to two in 100. Progestin-only oralcontraceptives are also available and reduce the risk of\\npregnancy by 89% to 95%.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nHampton, HL. “Care of the Woman Who Has Been Raped.”\\nNew England Journal of Medicine. 332 (26 January\\n1995): 234-237.\\nReynolds, Matthew W., Jeffery Peipert, and Beverly Collins.\\n“Epidemiologic Issues of Sexually Transmitted Diseasesin Sexual Assault Victims.” Obstetrical and Gynecologi-\\ncal Survey 55 (January 2000): 51-57.\\nORGANIZATIONS\\nRape, Abuse, and Incest National Network. 635-B Pennsylva-\\nnia Ave. SE, Washington, DC 20003.

Often temporary, a rash is onlyrarely a sign of a serious problem.\\nDescription\\nA rash may occur on only one area of the skin, or it\\ncould cover almost all of the body. Also, a rash may ormay not be itchy. Depending on how it looks, a rash maybe described as:\\n• blistering (raised oval or round collections of fluid\\nwithin or beneath the outer layer of skin)\\n• macular (flat spots)\\n• nodular (small, firm, knotty rounded mass)\\n• papular (small solid slightly raised areas)• pustular (pus-containing skin blister)\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are many theories as to the development of\\nskin rashes, but experts are not completely clear whatcauses some of them. Generally a skin rash is an inter-mittent symptom, fading and reappearing. Rashes mayaccompany a range of disorders and conditions, such as:• Infectious illness. A rash is symptom of many different\\nkinds of childhood infectious illnesses, includingchickenpox and scarlet fever . It may be triggered by\\nother infections, such as Rocky Mountain spotted\\nfever or ringworm .\\n• Allergic reactions. One of the most common symptoms\\nof an allergic reaction is an itchy rash. Contact der-\\nmatitis is a rash that appears after the skin is exposed to\\nan allergen, such as metal, rubber, some cosmetics orlotions, or some types of plants (e.g. poison ivy). Drugreactions are another common allergic cause of rash; inthis case, a rash is only one of a variety of possiblesymptoms, including fever , seizures, nausea and vom-\\niting ,diarrhea , heartbeat irregularities, and breathing\\nproblems. This rash usually appears soon after the firstdose of the course of medicine is taken.\\n•Autoimmune disorders . Conditions in which the\\nimmune system turns on the body itself, such as sys-\\ntemic lupus erythematosus or purpura, often have a\\ncharacteristic rash.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2820Rashes'),\n",

For example, scurvy , a disease\\ncaused by a lack of Vitamin C, has a rash as one of itssymptoms.\\n•Cancer . A few types of cancer, such as chronic lympho-\\ncytic leukemia, can be the underlying cause of a rash.\\nRashes in infancy\\nRashes are extremely common in infancy, and are\\nusually not serious at all and can be treated at home.\\nDiaper rash is caused by prolonged skin contact\\nwith bacteria and the baby’s waste products in a dampdiaper. This rash has red, spotty sores and there may bean ammonia smell. In most cases the rash will respondwithin three days to drying efforts. A diaper rash thatdoes not improve in this time may be a yeast infectionrequiring prescription medication. A doctor should beconsulted if the rash is solid, bright red, causes fever, orthe skin develops blisters, boils , or pus.\\nInfants also can get a rash on cheeks and chin caused\\nby contact with food and stomach contents. This rashwill come and go, but usually responds to a good clean-ing after meals. About a third of all infants develop“acne” usually after the third week of life in response totheir mothers’ hormones before birth. This rash will dis-appear between weeks and a few months. Heat rash is amass of tiny pink bumps on the back of the neck andupper back caused by blocked sweat glands. The rashusually appears during hot, humid weather, although ababy with a fever can also develop the rash.\\nA baby should see a doctor immediately if the rash:\\n• appears suddenly and looks purple or blood-colored• looks like a burn• appears while the infant seems to be sick\\nDiagnosis\\nA physician can make a diagnosis based on the med-\\nical history and the appearance of the rash, where itappears, and any other accompanying symptoms.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of rashes focuses on resolving the under-\\nlying disorder and providing relief of the itching that\\noften accompanies them. Soothing lotions or oral anti-\\nhistamines can provide some relief, and topical antibi-\\notics may be administered if the patient, particularly a\\nchild, has caused a secondary infection by scratching.The rash triggered by allergies should disappear as soon\\nas the allergen is removed; drug rashes will fade whenthe patient stops taking the drug causing the allergy. Forthe treatment of diaper rash, the infant’s skin should beKEY TERMS\\nPurpura —A group of disorders characterized by\\npurple or red brown areas of discoloration visiblethrough the skin.\\nScurvy —A nutritional disorder that causes skin\\nbruising and hemorrhages.\\nexposed to the air as much as possible; ointments are not\\nneeded unless the skin is dry and cracked. Experts alsorecommend switching to cloth diapers and cleaningaffected skin with plain water.\\nPrognosis\\nMost rashes that have an acute cause, such as an\\ninfection or an allergic reaction, will disappear as soon asthe infection or irritant is removed from the body’s sys-tem. Rashes that are caused by chronic conditions, suchas autoimmune disorders, may remain indefinitely orfade and return periodically.\\nPrevention\\nSome rashes can be prevented, depending on the\\ntriggering factor. A person known to be allergic to certaindrugs or substances should avoid those things in order toprevent a rash. Diaper rash can be prevented by usingcloth diapers and keeping the diaper area very clean,breast feeding, and changing diapers often.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nOrkin, Milton, et al. Dermatology.

Children are particularly likely to be bitten byrodents infesting their home, and are therefore most like-ly to contract rat-bite fever. Other animals that can carrythe types of bacteria responsible for this illness includemice, squirrels, weasels, dogs, and cats. One of thecausative bacteria can cause the same illness if it isingested, for example in unpasteurized milk.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are two variations of rat-bite fever, caused by\\ntwo different organisms. In the United States, the bacteriaStreptobacillus moniliformis is the most common cause\\n(causing streptobacillary rat-bite fever). In other coun-tries, especially Africa, Spirillum minus causes a different\\nform of the infection (called spirillary rat-bite fever).\\nStreptobacillary rat-bite fever occurs up to 22 days\\nafter the initial bite or scratch. The patient becomes illwith fever, chills, nausea and vomiting ,headache , and\\npain in the back and joints. A rash made up of tiny pink\\nbumps develops, covering the palms of the hands and thesoles of the feet. Without treatment, the patient is at riskof developing serious infections of the lining of the heart(endocarditis ), the sac containing the heart ( pericardi-\\ntis), the coverings of the brain and spinal cord ( meningi-\\ntis), or lungs ( pneumonia ). Any tissue or organ through-\\nout the body may develop a pocket of infection and pus,called an abscess .\\nSpirillary rat-bite fever occurs some time after the\\ninitial injury has already healed, up to about 28 days afterthe bite or scratch. Although the wound had appearedcompletely healed, it suddenly grows red and swollenagain. The patient develops a fever. Lymph nodes in thearea become swollen and tender, and the patient suffersfrom fever, chills, and headache. The skin in the area ofthe original wound sloughs off. Although rash is lesscommon than with streptobacillary rat-bite fever, theremay be a lightly rosy, itchy rash all over the body. Jointand muscle pain rarely occur. If left untreated, the feverusually subsides, only to return again in repeated two- tofour-day cycles. This can go on for up to a year,although, even without treatment, the illness usuallyresolves within four to eight weeks.\\nDiagnosis\\nIn streptobacillary rat-bite fever, found in the United\\nStates, diagnosis can be made by taking a sample of bloodor fluid from a painful joint. In a laboratory, the sampleKEY TERMS\\nAbscess —A pocket of infection; a collection of pus.\\nEndocarditis —An inflammation of the lining of the\\nheart.\\nMeningitis —An inflammation of the tissues cover-\\ning the brain and spinal cord.\\nPasteurization —A process during which milk is\\nheated up and maintained at a particular tempera-ture long enough to kill bacteria.\\nPericarditis —An inflammation of the sac contain-\\ning the heart.\\ncan be cultured, to allow the growth of organisms. Exami-\\nnation under a microscope will then allow identificationof the bacteria Streptobacillus moniliformis .\\nIn spirillary rat-bite fever, diagnosis can be made by\\nexamining blood or a sample of tissue from the woundfor evidence of Spirillum minus .\\nTreatment\\nShots of procaine penicillin G or penicillin V by\\nmouth are effective against both streptobacillary andspirillary rat-bite fever. When a patient is allergic to thepenicillins , erythromycin may be given by mouth for\\nstreptobacillary infection, or tetracycline by mouth forspirillary infection.\\nPrognosis\\nWith treatment, prognosis is excellent for both types\\nof rat-bite fever. Without treatment, the spirillary formusually resolves on its own, although it may take up to ayear to do so.\\nThe streptobacillary form, found in the United\\nStates, however, can progress to cause extremely serious,potentially fatal complications. In fact, before antibi-\\notics were available to treat the infection, streptobacil-\\nlary rat-bite fever frequently resulted in death .\\nPrevention\\nPrevention involves avoiding contact with those ani-\\nmals capable of passing on the causative organisms.

It is characterized by repeatedepisodes of color changes of the skin of digits on coldexposure or emotional stress .\\nDescription\\nRaynaud’s disease can be classified as one of two\\ntypes: primary (or idiopathic) and secondary (also calledRaynaud’s phenomenon). Primary Raynaud’s disease hasno predisposing factor, is more mild, and causes fewercomplications. About half of all cases of Raynaud’s dis-ease are of this type. Women are five times more likelythan men to develop primary Raynaud’s disease. The aver-age age of diagnosis is between 20 and 40 years. Approxi-mately three out of ten people with primary Raynaud’sdisease eventually progress to secondary Raynaud’s dis-ease after diagnosis. About 15% of individuals improve.\\nSecondary Raynaud’s disease is the same as primary\\nRaynaud’s disease, but occurs in individuals with a pre-disposing factor, usually a form of collagen vascular dis-ease. What is typically identified as primary Raynaud’s islater identified as secondary once a predisposing diseaseis diagnosed. This occurs in approximately 30% ofpatients. As a result, the secondary type is often morecomplicated and severe, and is more likely to worsen.\\nSeveral related conditions that predispose persons to\\nsecondary Raynaud’s disease include scleroderma ,sys-\\ntemetic lupus erythematosus ,rheumatoid arthritis\\nand polymyositis . Pulmonary hypertension and some\\nnervous system disorders such as herniated discs andtumors within the spinal column, strokes, and polio can\\nprogress to Raynaud’s disease. Finally, injuries due tomechanical trauma caused by vibration (such as thatassociated with chain saws and jackhammers), repetitivemotion ( carpal tunnel syndrome ), electrical shock, and\\nexposure to extreme cold can led to the development ofRaynaud’s disease. Some drugs used to control highblood pressure or migraine headaches have been knownto cause Raynaud’s disease.\\nThe prevalence of Reynaud’s Phenomena in the gen-\\neral population varies from 4–15%. Females are seventimes more likely to develop Raynaud’s diseases than aremen. The problem has not been correlated with coffeeconsumption, dietary habits, occupational history(excepting exposure to vibration) and exposure to mostdrugs. An association between Raynaud’s disease andmigraine headaches and has been reported. SecondaryRaynaud’s disease is common among individuals withsystemic lupus erythematosus in tropical countries.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere is significant familial aggregation of primary\\nRaynaud’s disease.

Age and smoking seem to be associ-\\nated with Raynaud’s disease only in men, while the asso-ciations of marital status and alcohol use with Raynaud’sdisease are usually only observed in women. These find-ings suggest that different mechanisms influence theexpression of Raynaud’s disease in men and women.\\nBoth primary and secondary Raynaud’s disease\\nsigns and symptoms are thought to be due to arteriolesover-reacting to stimuli. Cold normally causes the tinymuscles in the walls of arteries to contract, thus reducingthe amount of blood that can flow through them. In peo-ple with Raynaud’s disease, the extent of constriction isextreme, thus severely restricting blood flow. Attacks ortheir effects may be brought on or worsened by anxiety\\nor emotional distress.\\nThere are three distinct phases to an episode of Ray-\\nnaud’s disease. When first exposed to cold, small arteriesrespond with intense contractions (vasoconstriction). Theaffected fingers or toes (in rare instances, the tip of the noseor tongue) become pale and white because they are deprivedof blood and, thus, oxygen. In response, capillaries andveins expand (dilate). Because these vessels are carryingdeoxygenated blood, the affected area then becomes blue incolor. The area often feels cold and tingly or numb. After thearea begins to warm up, the arteries dilate. Blood flow issignificantly increased. This changes the color of the area toa bright red. During this phase, persons often describe theaffected area as feeling warm and throbbing painfully.\\nRaynaud’s disease may initially affect only the tips\\nof fingers or toes. As the disease progresses, it may even-tually involve all of one or two digits. Ultimately, all thefingers or toes may be affected. About one person in ten,will experience a complication called sclerodactyly. Insclerodactyly, the skin over the involved digits becomestight, white, thick, smooth and shiny. In approximately1% of cases of Raynaud’s disease, deep sores (ulcers)may develop in the skin. In rare cases of frequent, repeti-tive bouts of severe ischemia (decreased supply of oxy-\\ngenated blood to tissues or organs), tissue loss, or gan-\\ngrene may result and amputation may be required.\\nDiagnosis\\nPrimary Raynaud’s disease is diagnosed following\\nthe Allen Brown criteria. There are four components. Thecertainty of the diagnosis and severity of the diseaseincrease as more criteria are met. The first is that at leasttwo of the three color changes must occur during attacksprovoked by cold and or stress. The second is thatepisodes must periodically occur for at least two years.The third is that attacks must occur in both the hands andthe feet in the absence of vascular occlusive disease. Thelast is that there is no other identifiable cause for the\\nRaynaud’s episodes.\\nA cold stimulation test may also be performed to\\nhelp to confirm a diagnosis of Raynaud’s disease. Thetemperature of affected fingers or toes is taken. The handor foot is then placed completely into a container of icewater for 20 seconds. After removal from the water, thetemperature of the affected digits is immediately record-ed. The temperature is retaken every five minutes until itreturns to the pre-immersion level. Most individualsrecover normal temperature within 15 minutes. Peoplewith Raynaud’s disease may require 20 minutes or moreto reach their pre-immersion temperature.\\nLaboratory testing is performed frequently. Howev-\\ner, these results are often inconclusive for several rea-sons. Provocative testing such as the ice emergence justdescribed, is difficult to interpret because there is consid-erable overlap between normal and abnormal results. Theantinuclear antibody test of blood is usually negative\\nin Raynaud’s disease. Capillary beds under finger nailsusually appear normal. Erythrocyte sedimentation ratesare often abnormal in people with connective tissue dis-eases. Unfortunately, this finding is not consistent in peo-ple with Raynaud’s disease.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no known way to prevent the development\\nof Raynaud’s disease. Further, there is no known cure forthis condition. Therefore, avoidance of the trigger is thebest supportive management available. Most cases of pri-mary Raynaud’s disease can be controlled with propermedical care and avoidance.\\nMany people are able to find relief by simply adjust-\\ning their lifestyles. Affected individuals need to stay warm,and keep their hands and feet well covered in cold weath-er. Layered clothing, scarves, heavy coats, heavy socks,and mittens under gloves are suggested because glovesalone allow heat to escape. It is also recommended thatpatients cover or close the space between their sleeves andmittens. Indoors, they should wear socks and comfortableshoes. Smokers should quit as nicotine will worsen theproblem. Avoid the use of vibrating tools as well.\\nPeople with severe cases of Raynaud’s disease may\\nneed to be treated with medications to help keep the arte-rioles relaxed and dilated. Medications such as calcium-channel blockers, reserpine or nitroglycerin may be pre-scribed to relax artery walls and improve blood flow.\\nAlternative treatment\\nBecause episodes of Raynaud’s disease have also\\nbeen associated with stress and emotional upset, the con-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2824Raynaud’s disease'),\n",

Hypnosis, relaxation techniques, and visualiza-tion are also useful methods to help control emotions.\\nBiofeedback training is a technique during which a\\npatient is given continuous information on the tempera-ture of his or her digits, and then taught to voluntarilycontrol this temperature. Some alternative practitionersbelieve that certain dietary supplements and herbs may behelpful in decreasing the vessel spasm of Raynaud’s dis-ease. Suggested supplements include vitamin E (found infruits, vegetables, seeds, and nuts), magnesium (found inseeds, nuts, fish, beans, and dark green vegetables), andfish oils. The circulatory herbs cayenne, ginger and prick-ly ash may help enhance circulation to affected areas.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for most people with Raynaud’s dis-\\nease is very good. In general, primary Raynaud’s diseasehas the best prognosis, with a relatively small chance(1%) of serious complications. Approximately half of allaffected individuals do well by taking simple precau-tions, and never require medication. The prognosis forpeople with secondary Raynaud’s disease (or phenome-non) is less predictable. This prognosis depends greatlyon the severity of other associated conditions such asscleroderma, lupus, or Sjögren syndrome.\\nPrevention\\nThere is no way to prevent the development of Ray-\\nnaud’s disease. Once an individual realizes that he or shesuffers from this disorder, however, steps can be taken toreduce the frequency and severity of episodes.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCoffman, Jay D. D.

It also includeshyperbaric oxygen therapy.\\nPurpose\\nRecompression treatment is used to overcome the\\nadverse effects of gas embolism and decompression\\nsickness (sometimes called the bends) in underwater\\ndivers who breathe compressed air. It is also approvedfor treatment of severe smoke inhalation ,carbon\\nmonoxide poisoning , gas gangrene , radiation tissue\\ndamage, thermal burns , extreme blood loss, crush\\ninjuries, and wounds that won’t heal.\\nPrecautions\\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy delivers greater amounts\\nof oxygen more quickly to the body than breathing roomair (which is only 21% oxygen) at regular pressure.Unmonitored, increased oxygen can produce toxiceffects. Treatments must follow safe time-dose limits andmay only be administered by a doctor.\\nDescription\\nRecompression treatment is performed in a hyperbaric\\nchamber, a sealed compartment in which the patientbreathes normal air or “enhanced” air with up to 100% oxy-gen while exposed to controlled pressures up to three timesnormal atmospheric pressure. The patient may receive theoxygen through a face mask, a hood or tent around the head,or an endotracheal tube down the windpipe if the patient isalready on a ventilator. When used to treat decompressionsickness or gas embolism , the increased pressure reduces\\nthe size of gas bubbles in the patient’s body. The increasedoxygen concentration speeds the diffusion of the nitrogenwithin the bubbles out of the patient’s body. As gas bubblesdeflate, the trauma of gas embolism and decompressionsickness begins to resolve. Treatment for diving emergen-cies typically involves one session, lasting four to six hours,at three atmospheres of pressure.\\nWhen used to treat other conditions, the increased\\npressure allows oxygen and other gases to dissolve morerapidly into the blood and thus be carried to oxygen-starved tissues to enhance healing. Elevated oxygen lev-els can also purge toxins such as carbon monoxide fromthe body. In addition, when body tissues are super-satu-rated with oxygen, the destruction of some bacteria isenhanced and the spread of certain toxins is halted. Thismakes hyperbaric oxygen therapy useful in treating gasgangrene and infections that cause tissue necrosis(death ). Hyperbaric oxygen therapy also promotes the\\ngrowth of new blood vessels.\\nPreparation\\nOxygen is often administered to a patient as first aid\\nwhile he or she is being transported to a hyperbaricchamber. The treatment begins with chamber compres-sion; as the pressure of the chamber atmosphere increas-es, the temperature also rises and the patient’s ears mayfill as they would during an airplane landing. Swallowingand yawning are ways to relieve the inner ear pressure.Once the desired pressure is achieved, the patient is givenpure oxygen to breathe. Because treatment is lengthy,patients are encouraged to sleep or listen to music. Inlarger chambers, patients may also read or watch videos.\\nAftercare\\nDepending on the reason for treatment and the treat-\\nment outcome, the patient may be taken to a hospital forfurther care, or examined and released.\\nRisks\\nThere is minimal risk when recompression treatment\\nis administered by a competent physician. However,some common side effects are sinus pain , temporary\\nchanges in vision, and fatigue .\\nNormal results\\nWith prompt and appropriate recompression treat-\\nment, most patients show marked improvement in their\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2826Recompression treatment'),\n",

Cancer of the rec-tum is the disease characterized by the development ofmalignant cells in the lining or epithelium of the rectum.Malignant cells have changed such that they lose normalcontrol mechanisms governing growth. These cells mayinvade surrounding local tissue or they may spreadthroughout the body and invade other organ systems.\\nDescription\\nThe rectum is the continuation of the colon (part of\\nthe large bowel) after it leaves the abdomen and descendsinto the pelvis. Anatomically, it is divided into equalthirds; the upper, mid, and lower rectum.\\nThe pelvis and other organs in the pelvis form\\nboundaries to the rectum. Behind, or more accurately,posterior to the rectum is the sacrum (the lowest portionof the spine, closest to the pelvis). Laterally, on the sides,the rectum is bounded by soft tissue and bone. In front,the rectum is bounded by different organs in the male andfemale. In the male, the bladder and prostate are present.In the female, the vagina, uterus, and ovaries are present.\\nThe upper rectum receives its blood supply from\\nbranches of the inferior mesenteric artery from theabdomen. The lower rectum has blood vessels entering\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2827Rectal cancer'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 533}, page_content='from the sides of the pelvis. Lymph, a protein-rich fluid\\nthat bathes the cells of the body, is transported in smallchannels known as lymphatics. These channels run withthe blood supply of the rectum. Lymph nodes are smallfilters through which the lymph flows on its way back tothe blood stream. Cancer spreads elsewhere in the bodyby invading the lymph and vascular systems.\\nWhen a cell or cells lining the rectum become\\nmalignant, they first grow locally and may invade partial-ly or totally through the wall of the rectum. The tumorhere may invade surrounding tissue or the organs thatbound it, a process known as local invasion. In thisprocess, the tumor penetrates and may invade the lym-phatics or the capillaries locally and gain access to thecirculation in this way. As the malignant cells work theirway to other areas of the body, they again become locallyinvasive in the new area to which they have spread. Thesetumor deposits, originating in the primary tumor in therectum, are then known as metastasis. If metastases arefound in the regional lymph nodes, they are known asregional metastases. If they are distant from the primarytumor, they are known as distant metastases. The patientwith distant metastases may have widespread disease,also referred to as systemic disease. Thus the canceroriginating in the rectum begins locally and, given time,may become systemic.\\nBy the time the primary tumor is originally detected,\\nit is usually larger than 0.39 in (about 1 cm) in size andhas over a million cells. This amount of growth itself isestimated to take about three to seven years. Each timethe cells double in number, the size of the tumor quadru-ples. Thus like most cancers, the part that is identifiedclinically is later in the progression than would bedesired and screening becomes a very important endeav-or to aid in earlier detection of this disease.\\nPassage of red blood with the stool, (noticeable bleed-\\ning with defecation), is much more common in rectal can-cer than that originating in the colon because the tumor ismuch closer to the anus. Other symptoms (constipationand/ or diarrhea) are caused by obstruction and, less often,by local invasion of the tumor into pelvic organs or thesacrum. When the tumor has spread to distant sites, thesemetastases may cause dysfunction of the organ they havespread to. Distant metastasis usually occurs in the liver,less often to the lung(s), and rarely to the brain.\\nThere are about 36,500 cases of rectal cancer diag-\\nnosed per year in the United States. Together, colon andrectal cancers account for 10% of cancers in men and11% of cancers in women. It is the second most commonsite-specific cancer affecting both men and women.(Lung cancer is the first affecting both men and women,breast is the leader in women and prostate the leader inmen.) About 8,500 people died from rectal cancer in the\\nUnited States in 2000. In recent years the incidence ofthis disease is decreasing very slightly, as has the mortal-ity rate. It is difficult to tell if the decrease in mortalityreflects earlier diagnosis, less death related to the actualtreatment of the disease, or a combination of both fac-tors.\\nCancer of the rectum is felt to arise sporadically in\\nabout 80% of those who develop the disease. 20% ofcases are felt to have genetic predisposition that rangesfrom familial syndromes affecting 50% of the offspringof a mutation carrier, to a risk of 6% when there is just afamily history of rectal cancer occurring in a first-degreerelative. Development of rectal cancer at an early agesuggests a genetically transmitted form of the disease asopposed to the sporadic form.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses of rectal cancer are probably environmental\\nin the sporadic cases (80%), and genetic in the heredity-predisposed (20%) cases. Since malignant cells have achanged genetic makeup, this means that in 80% ofcases, the environment spontaneously induces change. Inthose born with a genetic predisposition, they are eitherdestined to get the cancer, or it will take less environmen-tal exposure to induce the cancer. Exposure to agents inthe environment that may induce mutation is the processof carcinogenesis and is caused by agents known as car-cinogens. Specific carcinogens have been difficult toidentify; dietary factors, however, seem to be involved.\\nRectal cancer is more common in industrialized\\nnations, and dietary factors are thought to be related tothis observation. Diets high in fat, red meat, total calo-ries, and alcohol seem to predispose. Diets high in fiberare associated with a decreased risk. The mechanism forprotection by high-fiber diets may be related to lessexposure of the rectal epithelium to carcinogens from theenvironment as the transit time through the bowel isfaster with a high-fiber diet than with a low-fiber diet.\\nAge plays a definite role in the predisposition to rec-\\ntal cancer. Rectal cancer is rare before age 40. This inci-dence increases substantially after age 50 and doubleswith each succeeding decade.\\nThere is also a slight increase risk for rectal cancer\\nin the individual who smokes.\\nPatients who suffer from an inflammatory disease of\\nthe colon known as ulcerative colitis are also at increasedrisk.\\nIn regards to genetic predisposition, on chromosome\\n5, there is a gene called the APC gene associated withfamilial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) syndrome. There\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2828Rectal cancer'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 534}, page_content='are multiple different mutations that occur at this site, yet\\nthey all cause a defect in tumor suppression that resultsin early and frequent development of colon cancer. Thisgenetic aberration is transmitted to 50% of offspring andeach of those affected will develop colon or rectal cancer,usually at an early age. Another syndrome, hereditarynon-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), is related tomutations in any of four genes responsible for DNA mis-match repair. In patients with colon or rectal cancer, thep53 gene is mutated 70% of the time. When the p53 geneis mutated and ineffective, cells with damaged DNAescape repair or destruction, allowing the damaged cellto perpetuate itself. Continued replication of the dam-aged DNA may lead to tumor development. Thoughthese syndromes (FAP and HNPCC) have a very highincidence of colon or rectal cancer, family history with-out the syndromes is also a substantial risk factor. Whenconsidering first-degree relatives, history of one withcolon or rectal cancer raises the baseline risk of 2% to6%, the presence of a second raises the risk to 17%.\\nThe development of polyps of the colon or rectum\\ncommonly precedes the development of rectal cancer.Polyps are growths of the rectal lining. They can be unre-lated to cancer, pre-cancerous, or malignant. Polyps,when identified, are removed for diagnosis. If the polyp,or polyps, are benign, the patient should undergo carefulsurveillance for the development of more polyps or thedevelopment of colon or rectal cancer.\\nSymptoms of rectal cancer most often result from\\nthe local presence of the tumor and its capacity to invadesurrounding pelvic structure:\\n• bright red blood present with stool• abdominal distention, bloating, inability to have a\\nbowel movement\\n• narrowing of the stool, so-called ribbon stools\\n• pelvic pain• unexplained weight loss• persistent chronic fatigue• rarely, urinary infection or passage of air in urine in\\nmales (late symptom)\\n• rarely, passage of feces through vagina in females(late\\nsymptom)\\nMost of the symptoms are understood on the basis of\\nobstruction or the invasion of surrounding pelvicanatomic structures. If the tumor is large and obstructingthe rectum, the patient will not be evacuating stool nor-mally and will get bloated and have abdominal discom-fort. The tumor itself may bleed and, since it is near theanus, the patient may see bright red blood on the surfaceof the stool. Blood alone (without stool) may also bepassed. Thus, hemorrhoids are often incorrectly blamed\\nfor bleeding, delaying the diagnosis. If anemia develops,which is rare, the patient will experience chronic fatigue.If the tumor invades the bladder in the male or the vaginain the female, stool will get where it doesn’t belong andcause infection or discharge. (This condition is also rare.)Patients with widespread disease lose weight secondaryto the chronic illness.\\nDiagnosis\\nScreening evaluation of the colon and rectum are\\naccomplished together. Screening involves physicalexam, simple laboratory tests, and the visualization ofthe lining of the rectum and colon. The ways to visualizethe epithelium are with x rays, (indirect visualization),and endoscopy, (direct visualization).\\nThe physical examination involves the performance\\nof a digital rectal exam (DRE). At the time of this exam,the physician checks the stool on the examining glovewith a chemical to see if any occult (invisible), blood ispresent. At home, after having a bowel movement, thepatient is asked to swipe a sample of stool obtained witha small stick on a card. After three such specimens are onthe card, the card is then easily chemically tested foroccult blood also. These exams are accomplished as aneasy part of a routine yearly physical exam.\\nProteins are sometimes produced by cancers and\\nthese may be elevated in the patients blood. When thisoccurs the protein produced is known as a tumor marker.There is a tumor marker for cancer of the colon and rec-tum; it is known as carcinoembryonic antigen, (CEA).Unfortunately, this may be made by other adenocarcino-mas as well, or it may not be produced by a particularcolon or rectal cancer. Therefore, screening by chemicalanalysis for CEA has not been helpful. CEA has been\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2829Rectal cancer\\nAn endoscopic view of a rectal tumor.

It is used in a follow-uprole, not a screening role.\\nDirect visualization of the lining of the rectum is\\naccomplished using a scope or endoscope. The physicianintroduces the instrument into the rectum and is able tosee the epithelium of the rectum directly. A simple rigidtubular scope may be used to see the rectal epithelium;however, screening of the colon is done at the same time.The lower colon may be visualized using a fiberopticflexible scope in a procedure known as flexible sigmoi-doscopy. When the entire colon is visualized, the proce-dure is known as total colonoscopy. Each type ofendoscopy requires pre-procedure preparation (evacua-tion) of the rectum and colon.\\nThe American Cancer Society has recommended the\\nfollowing screening protocol for those over 50 years:\\n• yearly digital rectal exam with occult blood in stool\\ntesting\\n• flexible sigmoidoscopy at age 50• flexible sigmoidoscopy repeated every five years\\nIf there are predisposing factors such as positive\\nfamily history, history of polyps, or a familial syndrome,screening evaluations should start sooner.\\nEvaluation of patients with symptoms\\nWhen patients visit their physician because they are\\nexperiencing symptoms that could possibly be related tocolon or rectal cancer, the entire colon and rectum mustbe visualized. Even if a rectal lesion is identified, theentire colon must be screened to rule out a syndromouspolyp or cancer of the colon. The combination of a flexi-ble sigmoidoscopy and double contrast barium enemamay be performed, but the much preferred evaluation ofthe entire colon and rectum is that of completecolonoscopy. Colonoscopy allows direct visualization,photography, as well as the opportunity to obtain a biop-sy, (a sample of tissue), of any abnormality visualized. If,for technical reasons the entire colon is not visualizedendoscopically, a double contrast barium enema shouldcomplement the colonoscopy. A patient who is identifiedto have a problem in one area of the colon or rectum is atgreater risk to have a similar problem in area of the colonor rectum. Therefore the entire colon and rectum need tobe visualized during the evaluation.\\nThe diagnosis of rectal cancer is actually made by\\nthe performance of a biopsy of any abnormal lesion inthe rectum. Many rectal cancers are within reach of theexaminer’s finger. Identifying how close to the anus thecancer has developed is very important in planning thetreatment. Another characteristic ascertained by exam iswhether the tumor is mobile or fixed to surrounding\\nstructure. Again, this will have implications related toprimary treatment. As a general rule, it is easier to identi-fy and adequately obtain tissue for evaluation in the rec-tum as opposed to the colon. This is because the lesion iscloser to the anus.\\nIf the patient presents with advanced disease, areas\\nwhere the tumor has spread, such as the liver, may beamenable to biopsy. Such biopsies are usually obtainedusing a special needle under local anesthesia.\\nOnce a diagnosis of rectal cancer has been estab-\\nlished by biopsy, in addition to the physical exam, anendorectal ultrasound will be performed to assess theextent of the disease. For rectal cancer, endorectal ultra-sound is the most preferred method for staging bothdepth of tumor penetration and local lymph nodemetastatic status. Endorectal ultrasound:\\n• differentiates areas of invasion within large rectal ade-\\nnomas that seem benign\\n• determines the depth of tumor penetration into the rec-\\ntal wall\\n• determines the extent of regional lymph node invasion\\n• can be combined with other tests (chest x rays and com-\\nputed tomography scans, or CT scans) to determine theextent of cancer spread to distant organs, such as thelungs or liver\\nThe resulting rectal cancer staging allows physicians\\nto determine the need for—and order of—radiation,surgery, and chemotherapy.\\nTreatment\\nOnce the diagnosis has been confirmed by biopsy and\\nthe endorectal ultrasound has been performed, the clinicalstage of the cancer is assigned. The staging characteristicsare utilized by the treating physicians to plan the specifictreatment protocol for the patient. In addition, the stage ofthe cancer at the time of presentation gives a statisticallikelihood of the treatment outcome, the prognosis.\\nClinical staging\\nRectal cancer first invades locally and then progress-\\nes to spread to regional lymph nodes or to other organs asnoted in the description above. Using the characteristicsof the primary tumor, its depth of penetration through therectum, local invasion into pelvic structure, and the pres-ence or absence of regional or distant metastases, stage isderived. A CT scan of the pelvis is very helpful herebecause the presence of invasion into the sacrum orpelvic sidewalls may mean that surgical therapy is notinitially possible. On this basis, clinical staging is used to\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2830Rectal cancer'),\n",

The pathologic stage is defined when\\nthe results of analyzing the surgical specimen are avail-able for assigning stage, (typically stage I and II).\\nRectal cancer is assigned stages I through IV , based\\non the following general criteria:\\n• Stage I: the tumor is confined to the epithelium or has\\nnot penetrated through the first layer of muscle in therectal wall.\\n• Stage II: the tumor has penetrated through to the outer\\nwall of the rectum or has gone through it, possiblyinvading other local tissue or organs.\\n• Stage III: Any depth or size of tumor associated with\\nregional lymph node involvement.\\n• Stage IV: any of previous criteria associated with dis-\\ntant metastasis.\\nSurgery\\nThe first, or primary, treatment modality utilized in\\nthe treatment of rectal cancer is surgery. Stage I, II, andeven suspected stage III disease are treated by surgicalremoval of the involved section of the rectum along withthe complete vascular and lymphatic supply. Most StageII and Stage III rectal cancers (based on endorectal ultra-sound, CT scan, and chest x ray) are treated with radia-tion and possibly chemotherapy prior to surgery.\\nA factor that needs to be considered when consider-\\ning primary treatment for rectal cancer is the surgeon’sability to reconnect the ends of the rectum. The pelvis isa confining space that makes the performance of thehook-up more difficult to do safely when the tumor is inthe lower rectum. The upper rectum does not usually pre-sent a substantial problem to the surgeon restoring bowelcontinuity after the cancer has been removed. Mid-rectaltumors, (especially in males where the pelvis is usuallysmaller than a woman’s), may present technical difficul-ties in hooking the proximal bowel to the remaining rec-tum. Technical advances in stapling instrumentation havelargely overcome these difficulties. If the anastomosis,(hook-up), leaks postoperatively, infection will ensue andin the past was a major cause of complications in resec-tion of rectal cancers. Today, utilizing the stapling instru-mentation, a hook-up at the time of original surgery ismuch safer. If the surgeon feels that the hook-up is com-promised or may leak, a colostomy may be performed. Acolostomy is performed by bringing the colon throughthe abdominal wall and sewing it to the skin. In thesecases the stool is thus diverted away from the hook-up,allowing it to heal and preventing the infectious compli-cations associated with leak. Later, when the hook-uphas completely healed, the colostomy can be taken downand bowel continuity thus restored.Stapling devices have allowed the surgeon to get\\ncloser to the anus and still allow the technical perfor-mance of a hook-up but there are limits. It is generallyfelt that there should be at least three centimeters of nor-mal rectum below the tumor or the risk of recurrencelocally will be excessive. In addition, if there is no resid-ual native rectum, the patient will not have normal sensa-tion or control and will have problems with uncontrol-lable soilage, (incontinence). For these reasons, patientspresenting with low rectal tumors may undergo totalremoval of the rectum and anus. This procedure is knownas an abdominal-perineal resection. A colostomy is per-formed in the lower left abdomen and it is permanent.\\nRadiation\\nAs mentioned, for many late stage II or stage III\\ntumors, radiation therapy can shrink the tumor prior tosurgery. The other roles for radiation therapy are as an aidto surgical therapy in locally advanced disease that hasbeen removed, and in the treatment of certain distantmetastases. Especially when utilized in combination withchemotherapy, radiation used postoperatively has beenshown to reduce the risk of local recurrence in the pelvisby 46% and death rates by 29%. Such combined therapyis recommended in patients with locally advanced prima-ry tumors that have been removed surgically. In the treat-ment of distant metastases, radiation has been helpful atreducing local effects from them, particularly in the brain.\\nChemotherapy\\nAdjuvant chemotherapy, (treating the patient who\\nhas no evidence of residual disease but who is at high riskfor recurrence), is considered in patients whose tumorsdeeply penetrate or locally invade (late stage II and stageIII). If the tumor was not locally advanced, this form ofchemotherapeutic adjuvant therapy may be recommendedwithout radiation. This therapy is identical to that of coloncancer and leads to similar results. Standard therapy istreatment with 5-fluorouracil, (5-FU) combined with leu-covorin for a period of six to 12 months. 5-FU is anantimetabolite and leucovorin improves the response rate.Another agent, levamisole, (which seems to stimulate theimmune system), may be substituted for leucovorin.These protocols reduce rate of recurrence by about 15%and reduce mortality by about 10%. The regimens dohave some toxicity but usually are tolerated fairly well.\\nSimilar chemotherapy is administered for stage IV\\ndisease or if a patient progresses and develops metastasis.Results show response rates of about 20%. A response is atemporary regression of the cancer in response to thechemotherapy. Unfortunately, these patients eventuallysuccumb to the disease. Clinical trials have now shown\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2831Rectal cancer'),\n",

Irinotecan does not seem toincrease toxicity but it improved response rates to 39%,added two-three months to disease free survival, and pro-longed overall survival by a little over two months.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative therapies have not been studied in a sci-\\nentific way so it is very difficult to make any recommen-dation. Large doses of vitamins, fiber, and green tea areamong therapies tried. Before initiating any alternativetherapies, the patient is wise to consult his/her physicianto be sure that these therapies do not complicate or inter-fere with the recommended therapy.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis is the long-term outlook or survival after\\ntherapy. Overall, about 50% of patients treated for colonand rectal cancer survive the disease.

Franz\\nRectal polyps\\nDefinition\\nRectal polyps are tissue growths that arise from the\\nwall of the rectum and protrude into it. They may beeither benign or malignant (cancerous).\\nDescription\\nThe rectum is the last segment of the large intestine,\\nending in the anus, the opening to the exterior of the body.Rectal polyps are quite common. They occur in 7–50% ofall people, and in two thirds of people over age 60.\\nRectal polyps can be either benign or malignant,\\nlarge or small. There are several different types ofpolyps. The type is determined by taking a sample of thepolyp and examining it microscopically. Most polyps arebenign. They are of concern, however, because 90% ofcolon and rectal cancers arise from polyps that are initial-ly benign. For this reason, rectal polyps are usuallyremoved when they are discovered.KEY TERMS\\nDRE—Digital rectal examination.\\nGastroenterologist —A physician who specializes\\nin diseases of the digestive system.\\nRectum —The last eight to ten inches of the colon,\\nof which the anus is a part and the openingthrough which wastes are removed from the body.Causes and symptoms\\nThe cause of most rectal polyps is unknown, howev-\\ner a diet high in animal fat and red meat, and low in fiber,is thought to encourage polyp formation. Some types ofpolyps are hereditary. In an inherited disease calledfamilial polyposis , hundreds of small, malignant and\\npre-malignant polyps are produced before the age of 40.Also, inflammatory bowel disease may cause growth ofpolyps and pseudo-polyps. Juvenile polyps (polyps inchildren) are usually benign and often outgrow theirblood supply and disappear at puberty .\\nMost rectal polyps produce no symptoms and are\\ndiscovered on routine digital or endoscopic examinationof the rectum. Rectal bleeding is the most common com-plaint when symptoms do occur. Abdominal cramps,pain , or obstruction of the intestine occur with some\\nlarge polyps. Certain types of polyps cause mucous-filledor watery diarrhea .\\nDiagnosis\\nRectal polyps are commonly found by sigmoi-\\ndoscopy (visual inspection with an instrument consist-\\ning of a tube and a light) or colonoscopy . If polyps are\\nfound in the rectum, a complete examination of the largeintestine is done, as multiple polyps are common. Polypsdo not show up on regular x rays, but they do appear onbarium enema x rays.\\nTreatment\\nNormally polyps are removed when they are found.\\nPolypectomy is the name for the surgery that removesthese growths. Polypectomy is performed at a hospital,outpatient surgical facility or in a doctor’s office,depending on the number and type of polyps to beremoved, and the age and health of the patient. The pro-cedure can be done by a surgeon, gastroenterologist, orfamily practitioner.\\nBefore the operation, a colonoscopy (examination of\\nthe intestine with an endoscope) is performed, and stan-dard pre-operative blood and urine studies are done. Thepatient is also given medicated enemas to cleanse the\\nbowel.\\nThe patient is given a sedative and a narcotic pain\\nkiller. A colonoscope is inserted into the rectum. Thepolyps are located and removed with a wire snare, ultra-sound, or laser beam. After they are removed, the polypsare examined to determine if they are malignant orbenign. When polyps are malignant, it may be necessaryto remove a portion of the rectum or colon to completelyremove cancerous tissue.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2834Rectal polyps'),\n",

The rectum is thefinal section of the large intestine.\\nDescription\\nRectal prolapse can be either partial or complete. In\\npartial prolapse, only the mucosa layer (mucous mem-brane) of the rectum extends outside the body. The pro-jection is generally 0.75–1.5 in (2–4 cm) long. In com-plete prolapse, called procidentia, the full thickness ofthe rectum protrudes for up to 4.5 in (12 cm).\\nRectal prolapse is most common in people over age\\n60, and occurs much more frequently in women than inmen. It is also more common in psychiatric patients. Pro-lapse can occur in normal infants, where it is usually tran-sient. In children it is often an early sign of cystic fibrosis\\nor is due to neurological or anatomical abnormalities.\\nAlthough rectal prolapse in adults may initially\\nreduce spontaneously after bowel movements, it eventu-ally becomes permanent. Adults who have had prior rec-tal or vaginal surgery, who have chronic constipation ,\\nregularly depend on laxatives ,h a v e  multiple sclerosis\\nor other neurologic diseases, stroke , or paralysis are\\nmore likely to experience rectal prolapse.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nRectal prolapse in adults is caused by a weakening\\nof the sphincter muscle or ligaments that hold the rectumin place. Weakening can occur because of aging , disease,\\nor in rare cases, surgical trauma. Prolapse is brought onby straining to have bowel movements, chronic laxativeuse, or severe diarrhea .\\nSymptoms of rectal prolapse include discharge of\\nmucus or blood, pain during bowel movements, and\\ninability to control bowel movements ( fecal inconti-\\nnence ). Patients may also feel the mass of tissue pro-\\ntruding from the anus. With large prolapses, the patientmay lose the normal urge to have a bowel movement.\\nDiagnosis\\nProlapse is initially diagnosed by taking a patient\\nhistory and giving a rectal examination while the\\npatient is in a squatting position. It is confirmed by sig-\\nmoidoscopy (inspection of the colon with a viewing\\ninstrument called a endoscope) Barium enema x rays\\nand other tests are done to rule out neurologic (nerve)disorders or disease as the primary cause of prolapse.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2835Rectal prolapse'),\n",

For partialprolapse in adults, excess tissue is surgically tied off withspecial bands causing the tissue to wither in a few days.\\nComplete prolapse requires surgery. Different surgi-\\ncal techniques are used, but all involve anchoring the rec-tum to other parts of the body, and using plastic mesh toreinforce and support the rectum. In patients too old, orill, to tolerate surgery, a wire or plastic loop can beinserted to hold the sphincter closed and prevent pro-lapse. Treatment should be undertaken as soon as pro-lapse is diagnosed, since the longer the condition exists,the more difficult it is to reverse.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative therapies can act as support for conven-\\ntional threatment, especially if surgery is required.Acupuncture ,homeopathy , and botanical medicine\\ncan all be used to assist in resolution of the prolapse or inrecovery from surgery.\\nPrognosis\\nSuccessful resolution of rectal prolapse involves prompt\\ntreatment and the elimination of any underlying causes ofprolapse.

The majorityof miscarriages occur during the first trimester. The num-ber of previous miscarriages does not affect subsequentfull-term pregnancies.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nRecurrent miscarriage can be caused by several fac-\\ntors, including fetal, placental, or maternal abnormalities.\\n• In over half of all miscarriages, the fetus is abnormal.\\nThe abnormality can either be genetic or developmen-tal. The fetus is very sensitive to ionizing radiation.Tobacco and even moderate alcohol consumption areknown to cause fetal damage that may lead to miscar-riage. There is some evidence that over four cups ofcoffee a day, because of the caffeine , adversely affect\\npregnancy , as well.\\n• Placental abnormalities, including abnormal implanta-\\ntion in the placental wall and premature separation ofthe placenta, can cause miscarriage.\\n• Maternal abnormalities include insufficient hor-\\nmones (usually progesterone) to support the preg-nancy, an incompetent cervix (mouth of the womb\\ndoes not stay closed), or a deformed uterus (womb).A deformed uterus can be caused by diethylstilbe-strol (DES) given to the mother’s mother during herpregnancy. Some immunologic abnormalities maycause the mother to reject the fetus as if it were aninfection or a transplant.

The indices are used tohelp in the differential diagnosis of anemia. They are alsocalled red cell absolute values or erythrocyte indices.\\nPurpose\\nAnemia includes a variety of conditions with the\\nsame outcome: a person’s blood cannot carry as muchoxygen as it should. A healthy person has an adequatenumber of correctly sized red blood cells that containenough hemoglobin to carry sufficient oxygen to all thebody’s tissues. An anemic person has red blood cells thatare either too small or too few in number. As a result, theheart and lungs must work harder to make up for the lackof oxygen delivered to the tissues by the blood.\\nAnemia is caused by many different diseases or dis-\\norders. The first step in finding the cause is to determinewhat type of anemia the person has. Red blood cellindices help to classify the anemias .\\nPrecautions\\nCertain prescription medications may affect the test\\nresults. These drugs include zidovudine (Retrovir),phenytoin (Dilantin), and azathioprine (Imuran).\\nDescription\\nOverview\\nAnemia has several general causes: blood loss; a\\ndrop in production of red blood cells; or a rise in thenumber of red blood cells destroyed.

Inherited disorders affect-ing hemoglobin, severe reactions to blood transfusions,prescription medications, or poisons can cause red bloodcells to burst (hemolyze) well before the end of theirusual 120-day lifespan.\\nAnemia of any type affects the results of one or\\nmore of the common blood tests. These tests are thehematocrit , hemoglobin, and red blood cell count. The\\nhematocrit is a measure of red blood cell mass, or howmuch space in the blood is occupied by red blood cells.The hemoglobin test is a measure of how much hemo-\\nglobin protein is in the blood. The red blood cell count(RBC) measures the number of red blood cells present inthe blood. Red blood cell indices are additional measure-ments of red blood cells based on the relationship ofthese three test results.\\nThe relationships between the hematocrit, the hemo-\\nglobin level, and the RBC are converted to red blood cellindices through mathematical formulas. These formulaswere worked out and first applied to the classification ofanemias by Maxwell Wintrobe in 1934.\\nThe indices include these measurements: mean cor-\\npuscular volume (MCV); mean corpuscular hemoglobin(MCH); mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration(MCHC); and red cell distribution width (RDW). They areusually calculated by an automated instrument as part of acomplete blood count (CBC). Indices are covered by\\ninsurance when medically necessary. Results are availablethe same day that the blood is drawn or the following day.KEY TERMS\\nAnemia —A variety of conditions in which a per-\\nson’s blood can’t carry as much oxygen as it shoulddue to a decreased number or size of red bloodcells.\\nHypochromic —A descriptive term applied to a red\\nblood cell with a decreased concentration of hemo-globin.\\nMacrocytic —A descriptive term applied to a larger\\nthan normal red blood cell.\\nMean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) —A mea-\\nsurement of the average weight of hemoglobin in ared blood cell.\\nMean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration\\n(MCHC) —The measurement of the average con-\\ncentration of hemoglobin in a red blood cell.Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) —A measure of\\nthe average volume of a red blood cell.\\nMicrocytic —A descriptive term applied to a smaller\\nthan normal red blood cell.\\nNormochromic —A descriptive term applied to a\\nred blood cell with a normal concentration ofhemoglobin.\\nNormocytic —A descriptive term applied to a red\\nblood cell of normal size.\\nRed blood cell indices —Measurements that\\ndescribe the size and hemoglobin content of redblood cells.\\nRed cell distribution width (RDW) —A measure of\\nthe variation in size of red blood cells.\\nMean corpuscular volume (MCV)\\nMCV is the index most often used. It measures the\\naverage volume of a red blood cell by dividing the hema-tocrit by the RBC. The MCV categorizes red blood cellsby size. Cells of normal size are called normocytic,smaller cells are microcytic, and larger cells are macro-cytic. These size categories are used to classify anemias.Normocytic anemias have normal-sized cells and a nor-mal MCV; microcytic anemias have small cells and adecreased MCV; and macrocytic anemias have largecells and an increased MCV . Under a microscope,stained red blood cells with a high MCV appear largerthan cells with a normal or low MCV .\\nMean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration\\n(MCHC)\\nThe MCHC measures the average concentration of\\nhemoglobin in a red blood cell. This index is calculatedby dividing the hemoglobin by the hematocrit. TheMCHC categorizes red blood cells according to theirconcentration of hemoglobin. Cells with a normal con-centration of hemoglobin are called normochromic; cellswith a lower than normal concentration are calledhypochromic. Because there is a physical limit to theamount of hemoglobin that can fit in a cell, there is nohyperchromic category.\\nJust as MCV relates to the size of the cells, MCHC\\nrelates to the color of the cells. Hemoglobin containsiron, which gives blood its characteristic red color. Whenexamined under a microscope, normal red blood cells\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2838Red blood cell indices'),\n",

These nor-mochromic cells have a normal MCHC. Cells with toolittle hemoglobin are lighter in color with a larger palearea in the center. These hypochromic cells have a lowMCHC. Anemias are categorized as hypochromic or nor-mochromic according to the MCHC index.\\nMean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH)\\nThe average weight of hemoglobin in a red blood\\ncell is measured by the MCH. The formula for this indexis the sum of the hemoglobin multiplied by 10 and divid-ed by the RBC. MCH values usually rise or fall as theMCV is increased or decreased.\\nRed cell distribution width (RDW)\\nThe RDW measures the variation in size of the red\\nblood cells. Usually red blood cells are a standard size.Certain disorders, however, cause a significant variationin cell size.\\nObtaining the blood sample\\nThe RBC indices test requires 0.17–0.24 oz (5-7 ml)\\nof blood. A healthcare worker ties a tourniquet on theperson’s upper arm, locates a vein in the inner elbowregion, and inserts a needle into that vein. Vacuum actiondraws the blood through the needle into an attached tube.Collection of the sample takes only a few minutes.\\nPreparation\\nThe doctor should check to see if the patient is tak-\\ning any medications that may affect test results. Thepatient does not need to fast before the test.\\nAftercare\\nAftercare consists of routine care of the area around\\nthe puncture mark. Pressure is applied for a few secondsand the wound is covered with a bandage.\\nRisks\\nThe primary risk is mild dizziness and the possibili-\\nty of a bruise or swelling in the area where the blood wasdrawn. The patient can apply moist warm compresses.\\nNormal results\\nNormal results for red blood cell indices are as follows:\\n• MCV 82–98 fl (femtoliters)• MCHC 31–37 g/dl\\n• MCH 26–34 pg (picograms)\\n• RDW 11.5–14.5%Abnormal results\\nThe category into which a person’s anemia is placed\\nbased on the indices provides a significant clue as to thecause of the anemia, but further testing is needed to con-firm a specific diagnosis.\\nThe most common causes of macrocytic anemia\\n(high MCV) are vitamin B\\n12and folic acid deficiencies.\\nLack of iron in the diet, thalassemia (a type of heredi-\\ntary anemia), and chronic illness are the most commoncauses of microcytic anemia (low MCV). Normocyticanemia (normal MCV) can be caused by kidney and liverdisease, bone marrow disorders, or excessive bleeding orhemolysis of the red blood cells.\\nLack of iron in the diet and thalassemia are the most\\ncommon causes of hypochromic anemia (low MCHC).Normocytic anemias are usually also normochromic andshare the same causes (normal MCHC).\\nThe RDW is increased in anemias caused by deficien-\\ncies of iron, vitamin B\\n12, or folic acid. Abnormal hemoglo-\\nbins, such as in sickle cell anemia, can change the shape ofred blood cells as well as cause them to hemolyze. Theabnormal shape and the cell fragments resulting fromhemolysis increase the RDW. Conditions that cause moreimmature cells to be released into the bloodstream, such assevere blood loss, will increase the RDW. The larger sizeof immature cells creates a distinct size variation.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nPagana, Kathleen Deska, and Timothy James Pagana, eds.\\nMosby’s Manual of Diagnostic and Laboratory Tests.

In 1867 the conditionwas called causalgia form the Greek term meaning“burning pain.” Causalgia refers to pain associated withmajor nerve injury. The exact causes of RSD are stillunclear. Patients usually develop a triad of phases. In thefirst phase, pain and sympathetic activity is increased.Patients will typically present with swelling ( edema ),\\nstiffness, pain, increased vascularity (increasingwarmth), hyperhydrosis, and x-ray changes demonstrat-ing loss of minerals in bone (demineralization). The sec-\\nond phase develops three to nine months later, It is char-acterized by increased stiffness and changes in theextremity that include a decrease in warmth and atrophyof the skin and muscles. The late phase commencing sev-eral months to years later presents with a pale, cold,painful, and atrophic extremity. Patients at this stage willalso have osteoporosis .\\nIt has been thought that each phase relates to a spe-\\ncific nerve defect that involves nerve tracts from theperiphery spinal cord to the brain. Both sexes are affect-ed, but the number of new cases is higher in women, ado-lescents, and young adults. RDS has been associatedwith other terms such as Sudeck’s atrophy, post-traumat-ic osteoporosis, causalgia, shoulder-hand syndrome, andreflex neuromuscular dystrophy.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe exact causes of RSD at present is not clearly\\nunderstood. There are several theories such as sympa-thetic overflow (over activity), abnormal circuitry innerve impulses through the sympathetic system, and as apost-operative complication for both elective and trau-matic surgical procedures. Patients typically developpain, swelling, temperature, color changes, and skin andmuscle wasting.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis is simple and confirmed by a local\\nanesthetic block along sympathetic nerve paths in thehand or foot, depending on whether an arm or leg isaffected. A test called the erythrocyte sedimentation\\nrate (ESR) can be performed to rule out diseases with\\nsimilar presentation and arising from other causes.\\nTreatment\\nThe preferred method to treat RSD includes sympa-\\nthetic block and physical therapy. Pain is improved asmotion of the affected limb improves. Patients may alsorequire tranquilizers and mild analgesics . Patients who\\nreceived repeated blocks should consider surgicalsymathectomy (removal of the nerves causing pain).KEY TERMS\\nAtrophy —Abnormal changes in a cell that lead to\\nloss of cell structure and function.\\nOsteoporosis —Reduction in the quantity of bone.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for treatment during phase one is\\nfavorable.

In so doing, they help to assess theintegrity of the nerve circuits involved. Reflex tests areperformed as part of a neurological exam, either a “mini-exam” done to quickly confirm integrity of the spinalcord, or a more complete exam performed to diagnosethe presence and location of spinal cord injury or neu-\\nromuscular disease.\\nDeep tendon reflexes are responses to muscle stretch.\\nThe familiar “knee-jerk” reflex is an example; this reflextests the integrity of the spinal cord in the lower backregion. The usual set of deep tendon reflexes tested, involv-ing increasingly higher regions of the spinal cord, are:\\n• ankle\\n• knee\\n• abdomen\\n• forearm\\n• biceps\\n• triceps\\nAnother type of reflex test is called the Babinski test,\\nwhich involves gently stroking the sole of the foot to assessproper development of the spine and cerebral cortex.\\nPrecautions\\nReflex tests are entirely safe, and no special precau-\\ntions are needed.\\nDescription\\nThe examiner positions the patient in a comfortable\\nposition, usually seated on the examination table withlegs hanging free. The examiner uses a rubber mallet tostrike different points on the patient’s body, and observesthe response. The examiner may position, or hold, one ofthe limbs during testing, and may require exposure of theankles, knees, abdomen, and arms. Reflexes can be diffi-cult to elicit if the patient is paying too much attention tothe stimulus. To compensate for this, the patient may beasked to perform some muscle contraction, such asclenching teeth or grasping and pulling the two handsapart. When performing the Babinski reflex test, the doc-tor will gently stroke the outer soles of the patient’s feet\\nwith the mallet while checking to see whether or not thebig toe extends out as a result.\\nNormal results\\nThe strength of the response depends partly on the\\nstrength of the stimulus. For this reason, the examinerwill attempt to elicit the response with the smallest\\nstimulus possible. Learning the range of normalresponses requires some clinical training. Responsesshould be the same for both sides of the body. A nor-mal response to the Babinski reflex test depends uponthe age of the person being examined. In childrenunder the age of one and a half years, the big toe willextend out with or without the other toes. This is due tothe fact that the fibers in the spinal cord and cerebralcortex have not been completely covered in myelin, theprotein and lipid sheath that aids in processing neuralsignals. In adults and children over the age of one anda half years, the myelin sheath should be completelyformed, and, as a result, all the toes will curl under(planter flexion reflex).\\nAbnormal results\\nWeak or absent response may indicate damage to the\\nnerves outside the spinal cord ( peripheral neuropathy ),\\ndamage to the motor neurons just before or just after theyleave the spinal cord (motor neuron disease), or muscledisease. Excessive response may indicate spinal corddamage above the level controlling the hyperactiveresponse. Different responses on the two sides of the bodymay indicate early onset of progressive disease, or local-ized nerve damage, as from trauma. An adult or olderchild who responds to the Babinski with an extended bigtoe may have a lesion in the spinal cord or cerebral cortex.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nMarsden, C. David, et al., eds.

Thesepressure points are reputed to connect directly throughthe nervous system and affect the bodily organs andglands. The reflexologist manipulates the pressure pointsaccording to specific techniques of reflexology therapy.By means of this touching therapy, any part of the bodythat is the source of pain, illness, or potential debility canbe strengthened through the application of pressure at therespective foot or hand location.\\nPurpose\\nReflexology promotes healing by stimulating the\\nnerves in the body and encouraging the flow of blood. Inthe process, reflexology not only quells the sensation ofpain, but relieves the source of the pain as well.\\nAnecdotally, reflexologists claim success in the\\ntreatment of a variety of conditions and injuries. Onecondition is fibromyalgia . People with this disease are\\nencouraged to undergo reflexology therapy to alleviateany of a number of chronic bowel syndromes associatedwith the condition. Frequent brief sessions of reflexolo-gy therapy are also recommended as an alternative todrug therapy for controlling the muscle pain associatedwith fibromyalgia and for relieving difficult breathingcaused by tightness in the muscles of the patient’s neckand throat.\\nReflexology applied properly can alleviate allergy\\nsymptoms, as well as stress, back pain, and chronicfatigue . The techniques of reflexology can be performed\\nconveniently on the hand in situations where a session onthe feet is not practical, although the effectiveness of lim-ited hand therapy is less pronounced than with the footpressure therapy.\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nReflexology is a healing art of ancient origin.\\nAlthough its origins are not well documented, there arereliefs on the walls of a Sixth Dynasty Egyptian tomb (c.2450 \\nB.C.) that depict two seated men receiving massage\\non their hands and feet. From Egypt, the practice mayhave entered the Western world during the conquests ofthe Roman Empire. The concepts of reflexology havealso been traced to pre-dynastic China (possibly as earlyas 3000 \\nB.C.) and to ancient Indian medicine. The Inca\\ncivilization may have subscribed to the theories of reflex-ology and passed on the practice of this treatment to theNative Americans in the territories that eventually\\nentered the United States.\\nIn recent times, Sir Henry Head first investigated the\\nconcepts underlying reflexology in England in the 1890s.Therapists in Germany and Russia were researching sim-ilar notions at approximately the same time, althoughwith a different focus. Less than two decades later, aphysician named William H. Fitzgerald presented a simi-lar concept that he called zone analgesia or zone therapy.Fitzgerald’s zone analgesia was a method of relievingpain through the application of pressure to specific loca-tions throughout the entire body. Fitzgerald divided thebody into 10 vertical zones, five on each side, thatextended from the head to the fingertips and toes, andfrom front toback. Every aspect of the human bodyappears in one of these 10 zones, and each zone has areflex area on the hands and feet. Fitzgerald and his col-league, Dr. Edwin Bowers, demonstrated that by apply-ing pressure on one area of the body, they could anes-thetize or reduce pain in a corresponding part. In 1917,Fitzgerald and Bowers published Relieving Pain at\\nHome , an explanation of zone therapy.\\nLater, in the 1930s, a physical therapist, Eunice D.\\nIngham, explored the direction of the therapy and madethe startling discovery that pressure points on the humanfoot were situated in a mirror image of the correspondingorgans of the body with which the respective pressurepoints were associated. Ingham documented her find-ings, which formed the basis of reflexology, in Stories\\nthe Feet Can Tell , published in 1938. Although Ingham’s\\nwork in reflexology was inaccurately described as zonetherapy by some, there are differences between the twotherapies of pressure analgesia. Among the more markeddifferences, reflexology defines a precise correlationbetween pressure points and afflicted areas of the body.Furthermore, Ingham divided each foot and hand into 12respective pressure zones, in contrast to the 10 verticaldivisions that encompass the entire body in Fitzgerald’szone therapy.\\nIn 1968 two siblings, Dwight Byers and Eusebia\\nMessenger, established the National Institute of Reflex-ology. By the early 1970s the institute had grown andwas renamed the International Institute of Reflexology.\\nIn a typical reflexology treatment, the therapist and\\npatient have a preliminary discussion prior to therapy, toenable the therapist to focus more accurately on thepatient’s specific complaints and to determine the appro-priate pressure points for treatment.\\nA reflexology session involves pressure treatment\\nthat is most commonly administered in foot therapy ses-sions of approximately 40–45 minutes in duration.

No artificial devices or special equip-\\nment are associated with this therapy. The human hand isthe primary tool used in reflexology. The therapistapplies controlled pressure with the thumb and forefin-ger, generally working toward the heel of the foot or theouter palm of the hand. Most reflexologists apply pres-sure with their thumbs bent; however, some also use sim-ple implements, such as the eraser end of a pencil.Reflexology therapy is not massage, and it is not a sub-stitute for medical treatment.\\nReflexology is a complex system that identifies and\\naddresses the mass of 7,000 nerve endings that are con-tained in the foot. Additional reflexology addresses thenerves that are located in the hand. This is a completelynatural therapy that affords relief without the use ofdrugs. The Reflexology Association of America (RAA)formally discourages the use of oils or other preparationsin performing this hands-on therapy.\\nPreparations\\nIn order to realize maximum benefit from a reflexol-\\nogy session, the therapist as well as the patient should besituated so as to afford optimal comfort for both. Patientsin general receive treatment in a reclining position, withthe therapist positioned as necessary—to work on thebare feet, or alternately on the bare hands.\\nA reflexology patient removes both shoes and socks\\nin order to receive treatment. No other preparation isinvolved. No prescription drugs, creams, oils, or lotionsare used on the skin.\\nPrecautions\\nReflexology is extremely safe. It may even be self-\\nadministered in a limited form whenever desired. Thequalified reflexologist offers a clear and open disclaimerthat reflexology does not constitute medical treatment inany form, nor is reflexology given as a substitute formedical advice or treatment. The ultimate purpose of thetherapy is to promote wellness; fundamentally it is aform of preventive therapy.\\nPeople with serious and long-term medical problems\\nare urged to seek the advice of a physician. Diabetespatients in particular are urged to approach this therapycautiously. Likewise pregnant women are cautionedemphatically to avoid reflexology during the early phasesof pregnancy altogether, as accidentally induced labor\\nand subsequent premature delivery can result fromreflexology treatment.\\nA consultation with a reflexologist is recommended in\\norder to determine the safety and appropriateness of reflex-ology therapy for a specific health problem or condition.EUNICE INGHAM (1889–1974)\\nEunice D. Ingham was born on February 24, 1889.\\nA physical therapist by occupation, she was a colleagueof Dr. Shelby Riley, who along with Dr. W. H. Fitzgeraldactively developed zone therapy, a similar but distincttherapy from reflexology. Unlike reflexology, zone ther-apy does not connect the zones with the body as awhole. In the 1930s, Ingham discovered an unmistak-able pattern of reflexes on the human foot; she subse-quently devoted the rest of her life to publicizing themessage of reflexology until shortly before her death onDecember 10, 1974.\\nIngham traveled and lectured widely about reflexol-\\nogy, initially to audiences of extremely desperate or agingpatients who had lost hope in finding relief. Because oftheir sometimes astonishing improvement, reflexologybecame better known and respected among the medicalcommunity and gained credibility for its therapeuticvalue. Ingham described her theories of reflexology in her1938 book, entitled Stories the Feet Can Tell , which\\nincluded a map of the reflex points on the feet and theorgans that they parallel. The book was translated intoseven languages, although it was erroneously publishedas Zone Therapy in some countries, an error which led to\\nmisunderstanding about the true nature of reflexologyand inaccurately linked it to zone therapy.\\nSide effects\\nBecause reflexology is intended to normalize the\\nbody functions, the therapy does not cause a condition toworsen. Most patients find that pain diminishes over thecourse of the therapy. It has been noted, however, thatsome patients experience greater discomfort in the sec-ond session than in the first session, because a significanteasing of pain and tension is generally associated withthe initial therapy session. As a result, when pressure isreapplied to the tender points of the foot during the sec-ond session, the sensitivity has been heightened. Thisincrease in sensitivity may cause minor additional dis-comfort for the patient.\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nAlthough only one controlled trial of reflexology\\ntherapy, done in 1993, has been documented in medicaljournals, this therapy is practiced worldwide at differentlevels of medical care. In Russia, for example, onlylicensed physicians may legally perform reflexologytreatment. In contrast, the practice is a commonplacehomestyle remedy in the Netherlands.

Themain types of rehabilitation are physical, occupational,and speech therapy.\\nEach rehabilitation program is tailored to the individ-\\nual patient’s needs and can include one or more types oftherapy. The patient’s physician usually coordinates theefforts of the rehabilitation team, which can include phys-ical, occupational, speech, or other therapists; nurses;engineers; physiatrists (physical medicine); psycholo-gists; orthotists (makes devices such as braces to straight-en out curved or poorly shaped bones); prosthetists (atherapist who makes artificial limbs or protheses); andvocational counselors. Family members are often activelyinvolved in the patient’s rehabilitation program.\\nPhysical therapy\\nPhysical therapy helps the patient restore the use of\\nmuscles, bones, and the nervous system through the useof heat, cold, massage, whirlpool baths, ultrasound,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2846Rehabilitation\\nA patient (holding paddles) is undergoing a hydrotherapy treatment.

It seeks to relieve pain ,\\nimprove strength and mobility, and train the patient toperform important everyday tasks. Physical therapy maybe prescribed to rehabilitate a patient after amputations,arthritis, burns , cancer, cardiac disease, cervical and\\nlumbar dysfunction, neurological problems, orthopedicinjuries, pulmonary disease, spinal cord injuries, stroke,traumatic brain injuries, and other injuries/illnesses. Theduration of the physical therapy program varies depend-ing on the injury/illness being treated and the patient’sresponse to therapy.\\nExercise is the most widely used and best known\\ntype of physical therapy. Depending on the patient’s con-dition, exercises may be performed by the patient aloneor with the therapist’s help, or with the therapist movingthe patient’s limbs. Exercise equipment for physical ther-apy could include an exercise table or mat, a stationarybicycle, walking aids, a wheelchair, practice stairs, paral-lel bars, and pulleys and weights.\\nHeat treatment, applied with hot-water compresses,\\ninfrared lamps, short-wave radiation, high frequencyelectrical current, ultrasound, paraffin wax, or warmbaths, is used to stimulate the patient’s circulation, relaxmuscles, and relieve pain. Cold treatment is applied withice packs or cold-water soaking. Soaking in a whirlpoolcan ease muscle spasm pain and help strengthen move-ments. Massage aids circulation, helps the patient relax,relieves pain and muscle spasms, and reduces swelling.Very low strength electrical currents applied through theskin stimulate muscles and make them contract, helpingparalyzed or weakened muscles respond again.\\nOccupational therapy\\nOccupational therapy helps the patient regain the\\nability to do normal everyday tasks. This may beachieved by restoring old skills or teaching the patientnew skills to adjust to disabilities through adaptiveequipment, orthotics, and modification of the patient’shome environment. Occupational therapy may be pre-scribed to rehabilitate a patient after amputation , arthri-\\ntis, cancer, cardiac disease, head injuries, neurologicalinjuries, orthopedic injuries, pulmonary disease, spinalcord disease, stroke, and other injuries/illnesses. Theduration of the occupational therapy program variesdepending on the injury/illness being treated and thepatient’s response to therapy.\\nOccupational therapy includes learning how to use\\ndevices to assist in walking (artificial limbs, canes,crutches, walkers), getting around without walking(wheelchairs or motorized scooters), or moving from onespot to another (boards, lifts, and bars). The therapist willvisit the patient’s home and analyze what the patient canand cannot do. Suggestions on modifications to the\\nhome, such as rearranging furniture or adding a wheel-chair ramp, will be made. Health aids to bathing andgrooming could also be recommended.\\nSpeech therapy\\nSpeech therapy helps the patient correct speech dis-\\norders or restore speech. Speech therapy may be pre-\\nscribed to rehabilitate a patient after a brain injury, can-cer, neuromuscular diseases, stroke, and otherinjuries/illnesses. The duration of the speech therapy pro-gram varies depending on the injury/illness being treatedand the patient’s response to therapy.\\nPerformed by a speech pathologist, speech therapy\\ninvolves regular meetings with the therapist in an individ-ual or group setting and home exercises. To strengthenmuscles, the patient might be asked to say words, smile,close his mouth, or stick out his tongue. Picture cards maybe used to help the patient remember everyday objectsand increase his vocabulary. The patient might use pictureboards of everyday activities or objects to communicatewith others. Workbooks might be used to help the patientrecall the names of objects and practice reading, writing,and listening. Computer programs are available to helpsharpen speech, reading, recall, and listening skills.\\nOther types of therapists\\nInhalation therapists, audiologists, and registered dieti-\\ntians are other types of therapists. Inhalation therapists helpthe patient learn to use respirators and other breathing aidsto restore or support breathing. Audiologists help diagnosethe patient’s hearing loss and recommend solutions. Dieti-\\ntians provide dietary advice to help the patient recover fromor avoid specific problems or diseases.\\nRehabiltation centers\\nRehabilitation services are provided in a variety of\\nsettings including clinical and office practices, hospitals,skilled-care nursing homes, sports medicine clinics, andsome health maintenance organizations. Some therapistsmake home visits. Advice on choosing the appropriatetype of therapy and therapist is provided by the patient’smedical team.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHertling, Darlene, and Randolph Kessler.

Reiki (pro-\\nnounced ray-key ) means “universal life energy” in Japan-\\nese, and Reiki practitioners are trained to detect and alle-viate problems of energy flow on the physical, emotional,and spiritual level. Reiki touch therapy is used in muchthe same way to achieve similar effects that traditionalmassage therapy is used—to relieve stress and pain, and\\nto improve the symptoms of various health conditions.\\nPurpose\\nReiki claims to provide many of the same benefits as\\ntraditional massage therapy, such as reducing stress,stimulating the immune system, increasing energy, andrelieving the pain and symptoms of health conditions.Practitioners have reported success in helping patientswith acute and chronic illnesses, from asthma and arthri-\\ntis to trauma and recovery from surgery. Reiki is a gentleand safe technique, and has been used successfully insome hospitals. It has been found to be very calming andreassuring for those suffering from severe or fatal condi-tions. Reiki can been used by doctors, nurses, psycholo-gists and other health professionals to bring touch anddeeper caring into their healing practices.\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nReiki was developed in the mid-1800s by Dr. Mikao\\nUsui, a Japanese scholar of religion. According to thestory that has been passed down among reiki teachers,Usui was a Christian who was intrigued by the idea thatChrist could heal sick people by touching them with hishands. Searching for clues that would explain the secretsof healing with hands, Usui made a long pilgrimagearound the world, visiting many ancient religious sects andstudying ancient books. Some reiki teachers claim thatUsui found clues leading back nearly 10,000 years to heal-ing arts that originated in ancient Tibet. During his intensestudies, Usui claimed he had a spiritual experience, whichenabled him to heal with his own hands by becomingaware of and tapping into the universal life force. Afterthat, he dedicated his life to helping the sick and poor. Hisreputation grew as he healed sick people for many years inKyoto, Japan. Before his death , Usui passed on his heal-\\ning insights using universal life energy to Dr. ChujiruHayashi, a close acquaintance. Hayashi, in turn, passed onthe healing techniques in 1938 to Hawayo Takata, a Japan-ese woman from Hawaii, whom he had cured of life-threatening illness using reiki methods. Takata became afirm believer and proponent of reiki, and during the 1970sformed an initiation program for training reiki masters topreserve Usui’s teachings. Before she died, she preparedher granddaughter, Phyllis Lei Furumoto, to continue the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2848Reiki'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 554}, page_content='lineage. Takata had personally trained 21 practitioners\\nbefore she died at the age of 80 in 1980. Along with otherreiki masters authorized by Takata, Furumoto formed thereiki Alliance. A faction led by Barbara Ray, formed theAmerican Reiki Association, which was known as Radi-ance Technique Association International. Today, there areover 1,000 reiki masters practicing around the world,whose methods can all be traced back directly to Dr. Usui.\\nThe basic philosophy of reiki\\nThe basic idea of reiki is that the body has an energy\\nfield that is central to its health and proper functioning,and this energy travels in certain pathways that canbecome blocked or weakened. This idea of energy flowin the body is also a central concept in Ayurvedic medi-\\ncine and traditional Chinese medicine , including\\nacupuncture .\\nReiki practitioners believe that everyone has the\\npotential to access the universal life energy, but that overtime most people’s systems become blocked and the ener-gy becomes weakened in them. A reiki practitioner istrained to be able to detect these blockages, and practition-ers will use their hands, thoughts, and own energy fields toimprove the energy flow in a patient. Reiki is one of themore esoteric alternative medical practices, because noone is sure exactly how it works on the physiological level.Practitioners claim that it works on very subtle energy lev-els, or possibly works on the chakra system. The chakras\\nare the system of seven energy centers along the middle ofthe body believed to be connected with the nervous andendocrine systems, as defined by yoga and Ayurvedic\\nmedicine. Reiki masters claim that healing energy caneven be sent to a person from far away, noting that reikiworks on the same principles that enables praying to workfor some patients, although a practitioner needs advancedtraining to be able to send energy from afar.\\nAccording to the original principles of Usui, patients\\nmust also have a proper attitude for reiki to work mosteffectively. Patients must take responsibility for theirown health, and must want to be healed. Furthermore,when energy is received from a reiki healer, patientsmust be willing to give back energy to others, and tocompensate the healer in some way, as well. Finally,Usui claimed that a healing attitude was free from worryand fear, was filled with gratitude for life and for others,and placed emphasis on each person finding honest andmeaningful work in their lives—all this, in order to com-plete the picture of overall health.\\nA reiki session\\nReiki sessions can take various forms, but most\\ncommonly resemble typical bodywork appointments,where the receiver lies clothed on his or her back on aMIKAO USUI (1865–1926)\\nMikao Usui, born in the Gifu Prefecture (Japan),\\nwas an ethereal child who sought to unravel the myster-ies of the universe. As an adult he developed an interestin the metaphysical healing talent of Buddha. Usuibecame determined to regenerate the healing secrets ofBuddha in order to improve the lot of humanity. Hetraveled to many temples and spoke with holy people,but all said that the secret of Buddha’s powers were lostto the world due to lack of use.\\nEventually the abbot of a Zen monastery encour-\\naged Usui to study the ancient writings containing thesecrets on healing. Usui learned two new languages,Chinese and Sanskrit, in order to understand the writ-ings better, and from his reading he obtained the formu-la for healing. The Sutras in particular provided theenlightenment that he sought.\\nUsui next set out to obtain the power to heal. It is\\nwidely believed that he developed that ability afterspending 21 days in retreat and in fasting on the holyMountain of Kori-yama, where he had a vision of lightand received the knowledge of the symbols of reiki andtheir use in healing. He officially formulated Usui Reikitherapy in 1922 and touted as many as one million fol-lowers during his lifetime.\\nPrior to the transition (death) of Usui, he imparted\\nthe secrets of healing to 16 teachers in order that thesecrets would not be lost again.\\nflat surface or massage table. A session generally lasts\\nfrom an hour to an hour and a half. Reiki is a simple pro-cedure, consisting of calm and concentrated touching,with the practitioner focusing on healing and givingenergy to specific areas on the receiver’s body. Practi-tioners place their hands over positions on the bodywhere the organs and endocrine glands reside, and theareas that correspond to the chakra centers. Practitionersalso use mental visualization to send healing energy toareas of the receiver’s body that need it. In special casesor with injuries, a no-touch technique is used, where thepractitioner’s hands are sometimes held just above thebody without touching it. Advanced practitioners rely onintuition and experience to determine which areas of abody need the most energy healing.\\nThe practitioner’s hands are held flat against the\\nreceiver’s body, with the fingertips touching. There canbe over 20 positions on both sides of the body where thehands are placed. The positions begin at the crown of thehead and move towards the feet. The receiver usuallyturns over once during the session. The practitioner’shands are held in each position for a usually five minutes,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2849Reiki'),\n",

In each position, the hands are kept stationary,unlike typical massage where the hands move, and boththe giver and receiver attempt to maintain an attitude ofawareness, openness, and caring.\\nReiki practitioners recommend that those receiving\\nreiki for the first time go through a series of three to fourinitial treatments over the course of about a week, toallow for cleansing and the initial readjustment of ener-gy. Reiki sessions can cost from $30–100 per session.Insurance coverage is rare, and consumers should consulttheir individual policies as to whether or not such thera-pies are included.\\nSelf-treatment with reiki\\nAlthough reiki practitioners believe that formal train-\\ning is necessary to learn the proper methods of energychanneling and healing, individuals can still use some ofthe basic positions of reiki to relieve stress and to stimulatehealing on themselves or another. The positions can beperformed anywhere and for however long they are need-ed. Positions generally move from the top of the bodydown, but positions can be used wherever there is pain orstress. Mental attitude is important during reiki; the mindshould be cleared of all stressful thoughts and concentrat-ed on compassion, love, and peace as forms of energy thatare surrounding, entering, and healing the body.\\nThe following positions are illustrated in Reiki:\\nEnergy Medicine:\\n• Position one: Hands are placed on the top of the head,\\nwith the wrists near the ears and the fingertips touchingon the crown of the head. Eyes should be closed. Hold forfive minutes or more, until the mind feels clear and calm.\\n• Position two: Cup the hands slightly and place the\\npalms over the closed eyes, with the fingers resting onthe forehead.\\n• Position three: Place the hands on the sides of the head,\\nwith the thumbs behind the ear and the palms over thelower jaws, with the fingers covering the temples.\\n• Position four: Place one hand on the back of the neck,\\nat the base of the skull, and put the other hand on thehead just above it, parallel to it.\\n• Position five: Wrap the hands around the front of the\\nthroat, and rest them there gently with the heels of thehands touching in front.\\n• Position six: Place each hand on top of a shoulder, close\\nto the side of neck, on top of the trapezius muscle.\\n• Position seven: Form a T-shape with the hands over the\\nchest, with the left hand covering the heart and the righthand above it, covering the upper part of the chest.• Position eight: The hands are placed flat against the\\nfront of the body with fingertips touching. Hold for fiveminutes or so, and repeat four or five times, movingdown a hand-width each time until the pelvic region isreached, which is covered with a v-shape of the hands.Then, for the final position, repeat this technique on theback, beginning as close to the shoulders as the handscan reach, and ending by forming a T-shape with thehands at the base of the spine.\\nSide effects\\nReiki generally has no side effects, as it is a very low\\nimpact and gentle procedure. Some receivers report tin-gling or sensations of heat or cold during treatment. Oth-ers have reported sadness or anxiety during treatment,\\nwhich practitioners claim are buried or repressed emo-tions being released by the new energy flow.\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nReiki has been used in major clinics and hospitals as\\npart of alternative healing practice, and doctors, dentists,nurses and other health professionals have been trainedto use its gentle touch techniques as part of their practice.To date, the little scientific research that has been con-ducted with reiki implies that its techniques bring aboutthe relaxation response , in which stress levels decrease,\\nand immune response increases. Reiki practitionersclaim that the most important measurement of their tech-nique is whether the individual feels better after treat-ment. They also claim that science cannot measure thesubtle energy changes that they are attempting to make.\\nTraining and certification\\nReiki practitioners undergo a series of attunements ,\\nwhich are sessions with reiki masters that teach the basicmethods of energy healing. Several organizations provideresources for reiki training. Reiki practitioners believethese attunements are necessary for correct technique. Themasters teach each person how to activate the universallife energy in themselves before they can pass it on to oth-ers. These initiations often are held during weekend work-shops. Trainees can achieve up to four levels of attune-ments, until they reach the level of master themselves. Thecertification process is not a formal one; masters approvestudents when they feel satisfied with their progress.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBaginski, B. J. and, S. Sharamon.

Itwas first described by Hans Reiter, a German physician,during World War I.\\nDescription\\nReiter’s syndrome is marked by a cluster of symp-\\ntoms in different organ systems of the body that may ormay not appear simultaneously. The disease may be acuteor chronic, with spontaneous remissions or recurrences.\\nRS primarily affects sexually active males between\\nages 20–40, particularly males who are HIV positive.Most women and children who develop RS acquire thedisease in its intestinal form.KEY TERMS\\nAttunement —Life energy teaching given by Reiki\\nmaster to a student.\\nChakra —One of seven major energy centers in the\\nbody, as defined by Hindu and yoga philosophy.\\nRelaxation response —Body’s response to relaxation\\ntechniques, during which metabolism and stresslevels decrease and immune response increases.Causes and symptoms\\nThe cause of Reiter’s syndrome was unknown as of\\nearly 1998, but scientists think the disease results from acombination of genetic vulnerability and various diseaseagents. Over 80% of Caucasian patients and 50–60% ofAfrican Americans test positive for HLA-B27, whichsuggests that the disease has a genetic component. Insexually active males, most cases of RS follow infectionwith Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum .\\nOther patients develop the symptoms following gastroin-testinal infection with Shigella ,Salmonella ,Yersinia ,o r\\nCampylobacter bacteria.\\nThe initial symptoms of RS are inflammation either\\nof the urethra or the intestines, followed by acute arthritisfour to 28 days later. The arthritis usually affects the fin-gers, toes, and weight-bearing joints in the legs. Othersymptoms include:\\n• inflammation of the urethra, with painful urination and\\na discharge from the penis\\n• mouth ulcers\\n• inflammation of the eye• keratoderma blennorrhagica. These are patches of scaly\\nskin on the palms, soles, trunk, or scalp of RS patients\\nDiagnosis\\nPatient history\\nDiagnosis of Reiter’s syndrome can be complicated\\nby the fact that different symptoms often occur severalweeks apart. The patient does not usually draw a connec-tion between the arthritis and previous sexual activity.The doctor is likely to consider Reiter’s syndrome whenthe patient’s arthritis occurs together with or shortly fol-lowing inflammation of the eye and the genitourinarytract lasting a month or longer.\\nLaboratory tests\\nThere is no specific test for diagnosing RS, but the\\nphysician may have the urethral discharge cultured torule out gonorrhea . Blood tests of RS patients are typi-\\ncally positive for the HLA-B27 genetic marker, with anelevated white blood cell (WBC) count and an increasedsedimentation rate of red blood cells. The patient mayalso be mildly anemic.\\nDiagnostic imaging\\nX rays do not usually reveal any abnormalities\\nunless the patient has had recurrent episodes of the dis-ease.

The ticks then acquire the bacteria,\\nand are able to pass it on to humans. TBRF is most com-mon in sub-Saharan Africa, parts of the Mediterranean,areas in the Middle East, India, China, and the south ofRussia. Also, Borrelia causing TBRF exist in the western\\nregions of the United States, particularly in mountainousareas. The disease is said to be endemic to these areas,meaning that the causative agents occur naturally andconsistently within these locations.\\nIn louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF), lice acquire\\nBorrelia from humans who are already infected. These\\nlice can then go on to infect other humans. LBRF is saidto be epidemic, as opposed to endemic, meaning that itcan occur suddenly in large numbers in specific commu-nities of people. LBRF occurs in places where povertyand overcrowding predispose to human infestation withlice. LBRF has flared during wars, when conditions arecrowded and good hygiene is next to impossible. At thistime, LBRF is found in areas of east and central Africa,China, and in the Andes Mountains of Peru.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn TBRF, humans contract Borrelia when they are\\nfed upon by ticks. Ticks often feed on humans at night,so many people who have been bitten are unaware thatthey have been. The bacteria is passed on to humansthrough the infected body fluids of the tick.\\nIn LBRF, a louse must be crushed or smashed in\\norder for Borrelia to be released. The bacteria then enter\\nthe human body through areas where the person mayhave scratched him or herself.\\nBoth types of relapsing fever occur some days after\\nhaving acquired the bacteria. About a week after becom-ing infected, symptoms begin. The patient spikes a veryhigh fever, with chills, sweating, terrible headache , nau-\\nsea, vomiting, severe pain in the muscles and joints, and\\nextreme weakness. The patient may become dizzy andconfused. The eyes may be bloodshot and very sensitiveto light. A cough may develop. The heart rate is greatly\\nincreased, and the liver and spleen may be swollen.Because the substances responsible for blood clottingmay be disturbed during the illness, tiny purple marksmay appear on the skin, which are evidence of minorbleeding occurring under the skin. The patient may sufferfrom a nosebleed , or may cough up bloody sputum. All\\nof these symptoms last for about three days in TBRF, andabout five days in LBRF.\\nWith or without treatment, a crisis may occur as the\\nbacteria are cleared from the blood. This crisis, called aJarisch-Herxheimer reaction, results in a new spike infever, chills, and an initial rise in blood pressure. Theblood pressure then falls drastically, which may deprive\\ntissues and organs of appropriate blood flow (shock).This reaction usually lasts for about a day.\\nRecurrent episodes of fever with less severe symp-\\ntoms occur after about a week. In untreated infections,fevers recur about three times in TBRF, and only once ortwice in LBRF.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of relapsing fever is relatively easy,\\nbecause the causative bacteria can be found by examin-ing a sample of blood under the microscope. The charac-teristically spiral-shaped bacteria are easily identifiable.The blood is best drawn during the period of high fever,because the bacteria are present in the blood in greatnumbers at that time.\\nTreatment\\nEither tetracycline or erythromycin is effective\\nagainst both forms of relapsing fever. The medicationsare given for about a week for cases of TBRF; LBRFrequires only a single dose. Children and pregnantwomen should receive either erythromycin or peni-cillin. Because of the risk of the Jarish-Herxheimerreaction, patients must be very carefully monitored dur-ing the initial administration of antibiotic medications.Solutions containing salts must be given through a nee-dle in the vein (intravenously) to keep the blood pres-sure from dropping too drastically. Patients withextreme reactions may need medications to improveblood circulation until the reaction resolves.\\nPrognosis\\nIn epidemics of LBRF, death rates among untreated\\nvictims have run as high as 30%. With treatment, andcareful monitoring for the development of the Jarish-Herxheimer reaction, prognosis is good for both LBRFand TBRF.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention of TBRF requires rodent control, espe-\\ncially in and near homes. Careful use of insecticides onskin and clothing is important for people who may beenjoying outdoor recreation in areas known to harbor thedisease-carrying ticks.\\nPrevention of LBRF is possible, but probably more\\ndifficult. Good hygiene and decent living conditionswould prevent the spread of LBRF, but these may be dif-ficult for those people most at risk for the disease.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2853Relapsing fever'),\n",

Bones all start out ascartilage in the fetus. Consequently, children have morecartilage than adults. Cartilage persists in adults in thelinings of joints, the ears, the nose, the airway and theribs near the breast bone. All these sites are attacked byrelapsing polychondritis, which usually occurs equally inmiddle-aged males and females. It is frequently diag-nosed along with rheumatoid arthritis ,systemic lupus\\nerythematosus , and other connective tissue diseases.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe most common first symptom of relapsing poly-\\nchondritis is pain and swelling of the external ear. Usually,\\nboth ears turn red or purple and are tender to the touch.The swelling can extend into the ear canal and beyond,causing ear infections, hearing loss , balance disturbances\\nwith vertigo and vomiting, and eventually a droopy ear.The nose is often afflicted as well and can deteriorate intoa flattened nose bridge called saddle nose. Inflammationof the eye occurs less frequently, but can lead to blindness.\\nAs relapsing polychondritis advances, it causes more\\ndangerous symptoms such as deterioration of the cartilagethat holds the windpipe open. Progressive disease candestroy the integrity of the airway and compromisebreathing. Destruction of the rib cartilage can collapse thechest, again hindering breathing. Joints everywhere areinvolved in episodes of arthritis, with pain and swelling.Other tissues besides cartilage are also involved, leadingto a variety of problems with the skin and other tissues.Occasionally, the aorta or heart valves are damaged.\\nThe disease may occur in episodes with complete\\nremission between, or it may smolder along for years,causing progressive destruction.\\nDiagnosis\\nA characteristic array of symptoms and physical\\nfindings will yield a diagnosis of relapsing polychondri-tis. Laboratory tests are sometime helpful. Biopsies ofthe affected cartilage may confirm the diagnosis. Furtherdiagnostic tests are done to confirm other associated con-ditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. It is important toevaluate the airway, although only 10% of patients willdie from airway complications.\\nTreatment\\nMild inflammations can be treated with aspirin or\\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such\\nas ibuprofen.

They may have to be continued over\\nlong periods of time, in which case their usage must beclosely watched to avoid complications. Immune suppres-sion with cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, cyclosporine,or dapsone is reserved for more aggressive cases. A col-lapsed chest or airway may require surgical support, and aheart valve or aorta may need repair or replacing.\\nPrognosis\\nThere is no known cure for relapsing polychondritis.\\nIt can only be combated with each onset of inflammationand deterioration of cartilaginous tissue. As the diseaseprogresses over a period of years, the mortality rateincreases. At five years duration, relapsing polychondri-tis has a 30% mortality rate.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nGilliland, Bruce C. “Relapsing Polychondritis and Other Arthri-\\ntides.” In Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine ,e d .\\nAnthony S.

This narrowing of the arter-ies diminishes the blood supply to the kidneys, which cancause them to atrophy and may ultimately lead to kidneyfailure. It may also cause renovascular hypertension ,o r\\nhigh blood pressure related to renal artery blockage.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe two main causes of renal artery stenosis are\\nartherosclerosis and fibromuscular disease.

Therefore, the body controls its chemicals verystrictly. The acid-base balance must be between a pH of7.35 and 7.45 or trouble will start. Every other chemicalin the body is affected by the acid-base balance. Themost important chemicals in this system are sodium,chloride, potassium, calcium, ammonium, carbon diox-ide, oxygen, and phosphates.\\nThe lungs rapidly adjust acid-base balance by the\\nspeed of breathing, because carbon dioxide dissolved inwater is an acid—carbonic acid. Faster breathing elimi-nates more carbon dioxide, decreases the carbonic acid\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2857Renal tubular acidosis'),\n",

Blood acidity from carbon dioxidecontrols the rate of breathing, not oxygen.\\nThe kidneys also regulate acid-base balance some-\\nwhat more slowly than the lungs. They handle all thechemicals, often trading one for another that is more orless acidic. The trading takes place between the bloodand the urine, so that extra chemicals end up passing outof the body. If the kidneys do not effectively eliminateacid, it builds up in the blood, leading to a conditioncalled metabolic acidosis . These conditions are called\\nrenal tubular acidosis.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are three types of renal tubular acidosis. They\\ninclude:\\n• Distal renal tubular acidosis (type 1) may be a heredi-\\ntary condition or may be triggered by an autoimmunedisease, lithium therapy, kidney transplantation ,o r\\nchronic obstruction.\\n• Proximal renal tubular acidosis (type 2) is caused by\\nhereditary diseases, such as Fanconi’s syndrome , fruc-\\ntose intolerance, and Lowe’s syndrome. It can alsodevelop with vitamin D deficiency , kidney transplan-\\ntation, heavy metal poisoning , and treatment with cer-\\ntain drugs.\\n• Type 4 renal tubular acidosis is not hereditary, but is\\nassociated with diabetes mellitus , sickle cell ane-\\nmia, an autoimmune disease, or an obstructed uri-nary tract.\\nSymptoms vary with the underlying mechanism of\\nthe defect and the readjustment of chemicals required tocompensate for the defect.\\n• Distal RTA results in high blood acidity and low blood\\npotassium levels. Symptoms include mild dehydration ;\\nmuscle weakness or paralysis (due to potassium defi-\\nciency); kidney stones (due to excess calcium in the\\nurine); and bone fragility and pain.\\n• Proximal RTA also results in high blood acidity and\\nlow blood potassium levels. Symptoms include milddehydration.\\n• Type 4 RTA is characterized by high blood acidity and\\nhigh blood potassium levels; it rarely causes symptomsunless potassium levels rise so high as to cause heartarrhythmias or muscle paralysis.\\nDiagnosis\\nRTA is suspected when a person has certain symp-\\ntoms indicative of the disease or when routine tests showKEY TERMS\\nAutoimmune disease —Type of diseases character-\\nized by antibodies that attack the body’s own tis-sues.\\nFanconi’s syndrome —A disorder of the kidneys\\ncharacterized by glucose in the urine.\\nLowe’s syndrome —A rare inherited disorder that is\\ndistinguished by congenital cataracts, glaucoma,and severe mental retardation.\\nRickets —A deficiency disease that affects the\\nbone development of growing bodies, usuallycausing soft bones.\\nhigh blood acid levels and low blood potassium levels.\\nFrom there, more testing of blood and urine chemicalswill help determine the type of RTA present.\\nTreatment\\nThe foundation of treatment for RTA types 1 and 2 is\\nreplacement of alkali (base) by drinking a bicarbonatesolution daily. Potassium may also have to be replaced,and other chemicals added to maintain balance. In type 4RTA acidity will normalize if potassium is reduced. Thisis done by changing the diet and by using diuretic medi-cines that promote potassium excretion in the urine.\\nPrognosis\\nCareful balancing of body chemicals will usually\\nproduce good results.

The disorder is not common.\\nDescription\\nRenal vein thrombosis occurs in both infants and\\nadults. Onset of the disorder can be rapid (acute) or grad-ual. The number of people who suffer from renal veinthrombosis is difficult to determine, as many people donot show symptoms, and the disorder is diagnosed onlyby specific tests. Ninety percent of childhood cases occurin children under one year old, and 75% occur in infantsunder one month of age. In adult women, oral contracep-tive use increases the risk of renal vein thrombosis.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn children, renal vein thrombosis almost always\\noccurs rapidly after an episode of severe dehydration .\\nSevere dehydration decreases blood volume and causesthe blood to clot more readily.\\nIn adults, renal vein thrombosis can be caused by\\ninjury to the abdomen or back, as a result of malignantkidney tumors growing into the renal vein, or as a resultof kidney diseases that cause degenerative changes in thecells of the renal tubules ( nephrotic syndrome ).\\nAcute onset of renal vein thrombosis at any age\\ncauses pain in the lower back and side, fever , bloody\\nurine, decreased urine output, and sometimes kidney fail-ure. In adults, when the onset of the disorder is gradual,there is a slow decrease in kidney function, and proteinappears in the urine. Many adults with renal vein throm-bosis show few symptoms.\\nDiagnosis\\nRenal venography , where a contrast material (dye)\\nis injected into the renal vein before x rays are taken, isone of the best ways to detect renal vein thrombosis.Other useful tests to detect a clot include computed\\ntomography scans (CT scans), magnetic resonance\\nimaging (MRI), and ultrasound.\\nTreatment\\nOne of the major goals of treatment is to prevent the\\nblood clot in the renal vein from detaching and moving intothe lungs, where it can cause serious complications as apulmonary embolism . The enzyme streptokinase may begiven to help dissolve the renal clot. Anticoagulant medica-\\ntions are usually prescribed to prevent clots from recurring.Rarely, when there is a complete blockage of the renal veinin infants, the kidney must be surgically removed.\\nPrognosis\\nMost cases of renal vein thrombosis resolve without\\nany permanent damage.

If clinical tests indicate this is so, the term used forthe rise in blood pressure is secondary hypertension.\\nRenal hypertension is the most common form of\\nsecondary hypertension and affects no more than onepercent of all adults with primary hypertension. Thereare two forms of renovascular hypertension.\\nIn atherosclerotic renovascular hypertension disease,\\nplaque is deposited in the renal artery. The deposits nar-row the artery, disrupting blood flow. Atheroscleroticrenovascular hypertension is most often seen in men overage 45 and accounts for two-thirds of the cases of reno-vascular hypertension. In most patients, it affects therenal arteries to both kidneys.\\nRenovascular hypertension caused by fibromuscular\\ndysplasia occurs mainly in women under age 45. It is alsothe cause of hypertension in 10% of children with the dis-order. In fibromuscular dysplasia, cells from the artery wallovergrow and cause a narrowing of the artery channel.\\nThe risk of having hypertension is related to age,\\nlifestyle, environment, and genetics. Smoking ,stress ,\\nobesity , a diet high in salt, exposure to heavy metals, and\\nan inherited predisposition toward hypertension allincrease the chances that a person will develop both pri-mary and renovascular hypertension.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nNarrowing of the renal artery reduces the flow of\\nblood to the kidney. In response, the kidney produces theprotein renin. Renin is released into the blood stream.Through a series of steps, renin is converted into anenzyme that causes sodium (salt) retention and constric-tion of the arterioles. In addition to atherosclerotic andfibromuscular dysplasia, narrowing of the renal arterycan be caused by compression from an injury or tumor,or by blood clots.\\nRenovascular hypertension is suspected when\\nhypertension develops suddenly in patients under 30 orover 55 years of age or abruptly worsens in any patient.Symptoms are often absent or subtle.\\nDiagnosis\\nNo single test for renovascular hypertension is\\ndefinitive. About half of patients with renovascularhypertension have a specific cardiovascular sound that isheard when a doctor listens to the upper abdomen with astethoscope. Other diagnostic tests give occasional falsepositive and false negative results. Most tests are expen-sive, and some involve serious risks.\\nImaging studies are used to diagnose renovascular\\nhypertension. In intravenous urography , a dye is inject-ed into the kidney, pictures are made, and the kidneys\\ncompared. In renal arteriography, contrast material isinserted into the renal artery and cinematic x rays (show-ing motion within the kidney) are taken. Studies of kid-ney function are performed. Tests are done to measurerenin production. The results of these tests taken togetherare used to diagnose renovascular hypertension.\\nTreatment\\nRenovascular hypertension may not respond well to\\nanti-hypertensive drugs. Percutaneous transluminalangioplasty (PTA), where a balloon catheter is used to\\ndilate the renal artery and remove the blockage, is effec-tive in improving the condition of about 90% of patientswith fibromuscular dysplasia. One year later, 60% remaincured. It is less successful in patients with atherosclero-\\nsis, where renovascular hypertension recurs in half the\\npatients. Where kidney damage occurs, surgery to repairor bypass the renal artery blockage is often effective. Insome cases, the damaged kidney must be removed.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatment stresses eliminating the root\\ncauses of hypertension. With renovascular hypertension, aswith primary hypertension, the root causes generally can-not be totally reversed by any method. Lifestyle changesare recommended. These include stopping smoking, eatinga diet low in animal fats and salt, avoiding exposure toheavy metals, stress control through meditation , and anger\\nmanagement. Herbal medicine practitioners recommendgarlic ( Allium sativum ) to help lower blood pressure. Con-\\nstitutional homeopathy and acupuncture also can be\\nhelpful in lowering blood pressure.\\nPrognosis\\nPTA is effective in many younger patients with\\nfibromuscular dysplasia. Older patients are less respon-sive to this treatment. Surgery is also more risky and lesssuccessful in older patients.\\nPrevention\\nRenovascular hypertension is possibly preventable\\nthrough lifestyles that prevent atherosclerosis and prima-ry hypertension.

This condition is brought about bya problem either involving the lungs and respiratory sys-tem or signals from the brain that control breathing.\\nDescription\\nRespiratory acidosis is an acid imbalance in the\\nbody caused by a problem related to breathing. In thelungs, oxygen from inhaled air is exchanged for carbondioxide from the blood. This process takes place betweenthe alveoli (tiny air pockets in the lungs) and the bloodvessels that connect to them. When this exchange of oxy-gen for carbon dioxide is impaired, the excess carbondioxide forms an acid in the blood. The condition can beacute with a sudden onset, or it can develop gradually aslung function deteriorates.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nRespiratory acidosis can be caused by diseases or con-\\nditions that affect the lungs themselves, such as emphyse-\\nma, chronic bronchitis ,asthma , or severe pneumonia .\\nBlockage of the airway due to swelling, a foreign object, orvomit can induce respiratory acidosis. Drugs like anesthet-ics, sedatives, and narcotics can interfere with breathing bydepressing the respiratory center in the brain. Head injuriesor brain tumors can also interfere with signals sent by thebrain to the lungs. Such neuromuscular diseases as Guil-\\nlain-Barré syndrome or myasthenia gravis can impair\\nthe muscles around the lungs making it more difficult tobreathe. Conditions that cause chronic metabolic alkalosis\\ncan also trigger respiratory acidosis.\\nThe most notable symptom will be slowed or diffi-\\ncult breathing. Headache , drowsiness, restlessness,\\ntremor, and confusion may also occur. A rapid heart rate,changes in blood pressure, and swelling of blood vesselsKEY TERMS\\npH—A measurement of acid or alkali (base) of a\\nsolution based on the amount of hydrogen ionsavailable. Based on a scale of 14, a pH of 7.0 isneutral. A pH below 7.0 is an acid; the lower thenumber, the stronger the acid. A pH above 7.0 is abase; the higher the number, the stronger the base.Blood pH is slightly alkali with a normal range of7.36–7.44.\\nin the eyes may be noted upon examination. This condi-\\ntion can trigger the body to respond with symptoms ofmetabolic alkalosis, which may include cyanosis ,a\\nbluish or purplish discoloration of the skin due to inade-quate oxygen intake.

This condition produces a shiftin the body’s pH balance and causes the body’s system tobecome more alkaline. This condition is brought on byrapid, deep breathing called hyperventilation .\\nDescription\\nRespiratory alkalosis is an alkali imbalance in the\\nbody caused by a lower-than-normal level of carbon diox-ide in the blood. In the lungs, oxygen from inhaled air isexchanged for carbon dioxide from the blood. This processtakes place between the alveoli (tiny air pockets in thelungs) and the blood vessels that connect to them. When aperson hyperventilates, this exchange of oxygen for carbondioxide is speeded up, and the person exhales too muchcarbon dioxide. This lowered level of carbon dioxide caus-es the pH of the blood to increase, leading to alkalosis.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe primary cause of respiratory alkalosis is hyper-\\nventilation. This rapid, deep breathing can be caused byKEY TERMS\\nHyperventilation —Rapid, deep breathing, possi-\\nbly exceeding 40 breaths/minute. The most com-mon cause is anxiety, although fever, aspirin over-dose, serious infections, stroke, or other diseasesof the brain or nervous system.\\npH—A measurement of acid or alkali (base) of a\\nsolution based on the amount of hydrogen ionsavailable.

Other stresses to the body,including pregnancy , liver failure, high elevations, or\\nmetabolic acidosis can also trigger hyperventilation\\nleading to respiratory alkalosis.\\nHyperventilation, the primary cause of respiratory\\nalkalosis, is also the primary symptom. This symptom isaccompanied by dizziness , light headedness, agitation,\\nand tingling or numbing around the mouth and in the fin-gers and hands. Muscle twitching, spasms, and weaknessmay be noted.

Thelungs are said to be “airless.” Without treatment, theinfant will die within a few days after birth, but if oxygencan be provided, and the infant receives modern treat-ment in a neonatal intensive care unit, complete recoverywith no after-effects can be expected.\\nDescription\\nIf a newborn infant is to breathe properly, the small\\nair sacs (alveoli) at the ends of the breathing tubes mustremain open so that oxygen in the air can get into the tinyblood vessels that surround the alveoli. Normally, in thelast months of pregnancy , cells in the alveoli produce a\\nsubstance called surfactant, which keep the surface ten-sion inside the alveoli low so that the sacs can expand atthe moment of birth, and the infant can breathe normally.Surfactant is produced starting at about 34 weeks ofpregnancy and, by the time the fetal lungs mature at 37weeks, a normal amount is present.\\nIf an infant is born prematurely, enough surfactant\\nmight not have formed in the alveoli causing the lungs tocollapse and making it very difficult for the baby to getenough air (and the oxygen it contains). Sometimes alayer of fibrous tissue called a hyaline membrane formsin the air sacs, making it even harder for oxygen to getthrough to the blood vessels. RDS in newborn infantsused to be called hyaline membrane disease.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nRDS nearly always occurs in premature infants, and\\nthe more premature the birth, the greater is the chancethat RDS will develop. RDS also is seen in some infantswhose mothers are diabetic. Paradoxically, RDS is lesslikely in the presence of certain states or conditions whichthemselves are harmful: abnormally slow growth of thefetus; high blood pressure, a condition called toxemia inthe mother; and early rupture of the birth membranes.\\nLabored breathing (the “respiratory distress” of\\nRDS) may begin as soon as the infant is born, or within afew hours. Breathing becomes very rapid, the nostrilsflare, and the infant grunts with each breath. The ribs,which are very flexible in young infants, move inwardseach time a breath is taken. Before long the muscles thatmove the ribs and diaphragm, so that air is drawn into thelungs, become fatigued. When the oxygen level in theblood drops severely the infant’s skin turns bluish incolor. Tiny, very premature infants may not even havesigns of trouble breathing. Their lungs may be so stiffthat they cannot even start breathing when born.\\nThere are two major complications of RDS. One is\\ncalled pneumothorax , which means “air in the chest.”\\nWhen the infant itself or a breathing machine appliespressure on the lungs in an attempt to expand them, a lungmay rupture, causing air to leak into the chest cavity. Thisair causes the lung to collapse further, making breathingeven harder and interfering with blood flow in the lungarteries. The blood pressure can drop suddenly, cuttingthe blood supply to the brain. The other complication iscalled intraventricular hemorrhage; this is bleeding intothe cavities (ventricles) of the brain, which may be fatal.\\nDiagnosis\\nWhen a premature infant has obvious trouble breath-\\ning when born or within a few hours of birth, RDS is an\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2863Respiratory distress syndrome'),\n",

If premature birth is expected, or\\nthere is some condition that calls for delivery as soon aspossible, the amount of surfactant in the amniotic fluidwill indicate how well the lungs have matured. If littlesurfactant is found in an amniotic fluid sample taken byplacing a needle in the uterus ( amniocentesis ), there is a\\ndefinite risk of RDS. Often this test is done at regularintervals so that the infant can be delivered as soon as thelungs are mature. If the membranes have ruptured, surfac-tant can easily be measured in a sample of vaginal fluid.\\nThe other major diagnostic test is a chest x ray . Col-\\nlapsed lung tissue has a typical appearance, and the morelung tissue is collapsed, the more severe the RDS. An xray also can demonstrate pneumothorax (air or gas in thearea around the lung), if this complication has occurred.The level of oxygen in the blood can be measured by tak-ing a blood sample from an artery, or, more easily, usinga device called an oximeter, which is clipped to an ear-lobe. Pneumothorax may have occurred if the infant sud-denly becomes worse while on ventilation; x rays canhelp make the diagnosis.\\nTreatment\\nIf only a mild degree of RDS is present at birth, placing\\nthe infant in an oxygen hood may be enough. It is importantto guard against too much oxygen, as this may damage theretina and cause loss of vision. Using an oximeter to keeptrack of the blood oxygen level, repeated artery punctures orheel sticks can be avoided.

Typically theinfant will be able to breathe more easily within a few daysat the most, and complications such as lung rupture are lesslikely to occur. The drug is continued until the infant startsproducing its own surfactant. There is a risk of bleeding intothe lungs from surfactant treatment; about 10% of the small-est infants are affected.\\nInfants with severe RDS may require treatment with\\na ventilator, a machine that takes over the work of thelungs and delivers air under pressure. In tiny infants whodo not breathe when born, ventilation through a trachealtube is an emergency procedure. Assisted ventilation mustbe closely supervised, as too much pressure can causefurther lung damage. A gentler way of assisting breathing,continuous positive airway pressure or CPAP, delivers anoxygen mixture through nasal prongs or a tube placedthrough the nose rather than an endotracheal tube. CPAPmay be tried before resorting to a ventilator, or after aninfant placed on a ventilator begins to improve.

Death is the result. The central nervous\\nsystem in particular—made up of the brain and spinalcord—is very dependent on a steady oxygen supply and isone of the first organ systems to feel the effects of RDS.On the other hand, if the infant’s breathing is supporteduntil the lungs mature and make their own surfactant,complete recovery within three to five days is the rule.\\nIf an air leak causes pneumothorax, immediate\\nremoval of air from the chest will allow the lungs to re-expand. Bleeding into the brain is a very serious condi-tion that worsens the outlook for an infant with RDS.\\nPrevention\\nThe best way of preventing RDS is to delay delivery\\nuntil the fetal lungs have matured and are producingenough surfactant—generally at about 37 weeks of preg-nancy. If delivery cannot be delayed, the mother may begiven a steroid hormone, similar to a natural substanceproduced in the body, which crosses the barrier of theplacenta and helps the fetal lungs to produce surfactant.The steroid should be given at least 24 hours before theexpected time of delivery. If the infant does developRDS, the risk of bleeding into the brain will be much lessif the mother has been given a dose of steroid.\\nIf a very premature infant is born without symptoms\\nof RDS, it may be wise to deliver surfactant to its lungs.This may prevent RDS, or make it less severe if it doesdevelop. An alternative is to wait until the first symptomsof RDS appear and then immediately give surfactant.Pneumothorax may be prevented by frequently checkingthe blood oxygen content, and limiting oxygen treatmentunder pressure to the minimum needed.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBerkow, Robert, ed.

Cramer, MD\\nRespiratory failure\\nDefinition\\nRespiratory failure is nearly any condition that\\naffects breathing function or the lungs themselves andcan result in failure of the lungs to function properly. Themain tasks of the lungs and chest are to get oxygen fromthe air that is inhaled into the bloodstream, and, at thesame to time, to eliminate carbon dioxide (C0\\n2) from the\\nblood through air that is breathed out. In respiratory fail-ure, the level of oxygen in the blood becomes dangerous-ly low, and/or the level of C0\\n2becomes dangerously\\nhigh. There are two ways in which this can happen.Either the process by which oxygen and C0\\n2are\\nexchanged between the blood and the air spaces of thelungs (a process called “gas exchange”) breaks down, orthe movement of air in and out of the lungs (ventilation)does not take place properly.\\nDescription\\nRespiratory failure often is divided into two main\\ntypes. One of them, called hypoxemic respiratory failure,occurs when something interferes with normal gasexchange. Too little oxygen gets into the blood (hypox-emia), and all organs and tissues in the body suffer as aresult. One common type of hypoxemic failure, occur-ring in both adults and prematurely born infants, is respi-\\nratory distress syndrome , a condition in which fluid or\\ntissue changes prevent oxygen from passing out of the airsacs of the lungs into the circulating blood. Hypoxemiaalso may result from spending time at high altitudes(where there is less oxygen in the air); various forms oflung disease that separate oxygen from blood in thelungs; severe anemia (“low blood”); and blood vesseldisorders that shunt blood away from the lungs, thus pre-cluding the lungs from picking up oxygen.\\nThe other main type of respiratory failure is ventila-\\ntory failure, occurring when, for any reason, breathing isnot strong enough to rid the body of C0\\n2. Then CO2\\nbuilds up in the blood (hypercapnia). Ventilatory failurecan result when the respiratory center in the brainstemfails to drive breathing; when muscle disease keeps thechest wall from expanding when breathing in; or when apatient has chronic obstructive lung disease that\\nmakes it very difficult to exhale air with its C0\\n2. Many of\\nthe specific diseases and conditions that cause respirato-ry failure cause both too little oxygen in the blood(hypoxemia) and abnormal ventilation.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSeveral different abnormalities of breathing function\\ncan cause respiratory failure. The major categories, withspecific examples of each, are:\\n• Obstruction of the airways. Examples are chronic\\nbronchitis with heavy secretions; emphysema ; cystic\\nfibrosis ; asthma (a condition in which it is very hard to\\nget air in and out through narrowed breathing tubes).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2865Respiratory failure'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 571}, page_content='• Weak breathing. This can be caused by drugs or alco-\\nhol, which depress the respiratory center; extreme obe-\\nsity; or sleep apnea , where patients stop breathing for\\nlong periods while sleeping.\\n• Muscle weakness. This can be caused by a muscle dis-\\nease called myasthenia; muscular dystrophy ; polio ; a\\nstroke that paralyzes the respiratory muscles; injury of\\nthe spinal cord; or Lou Gehrig’s disease.\\n• Lung diseases, including severe pneumonia . Pul-\\nmonary edema , or fluid in the lungs, can be the source\\nof respiratory failure. Also, it can often be a result ofheart disease; respiratory distress syndrome; pul-\\nmonary fibrosis and other scarring diseases of the\\nlung; radiation exposure; burn injury when smoke isinhaled; and widespread lung cancer .\\n• An abnormal chest wall (a condition that can be caused\\nby scoliosis or severe injury of the chest wall).\\nA majority of patients with respiratory failure are\\nshort of breath. Both low oxygen and high carbon dioxidecan impair mental functions. Patients may become con-fused and disoriented and find it impossible to carry outtheir normal activities or do their work. Marked C0\\n2excess\\ncan cause headaches and, in time, a semi-conscious state,or even coma . Low blood oxygen causes the skin to take\\non a bluish tinge. It also can cause an abnormal heartrhythm (arrhythmia). Physical examination may show a\\npatient who is breathing rapidly, is restless, and has a rapidpulse. Lung disease may cause abnormal sounds heardwhen listening to the chest with a stethoscope: wheezing\\nin asthma, “crackles” in obstructive lung disease. A patientwith ventilatory failure is prone to gasp for breath, andmay use the neck muscles to help expand the chest.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe symptoms and signs of respiratory failure are\\nnot specific. Rather, they depend on what is causing thefailure and on the patient’s condition before it developed.Good general health and some degree of “reserve” lungfunction will help see a patient through an episode of res-piratory failure. The key diagnostic determination is tomeasure the amount of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and acidin the blood at regular intervals. A sudden low oxygenlevel in the lung tissue may cause the arteries of the lungsto narrow. This, in turn, causes the resistance in thesevessels to increase, which can be measured using a spe-cial catheter. A high blood level of C0\\n2may cause\\nincreased pressure in the fluid surrounding the brain andspinal cord; this, too, can be measured.\\nTreatment\\nNearly all patients are given oxygen as the first treat-\\nment. Then the underlying cause of respiratory failuremust be treated. For example, antibiotics are used to\\nfight a lung infection, or, for an asthmatic patient, a drugto open up the airways is commonly prescribed.\\nA patient whose breathing remains very poor will\\nrequire a ventilator to aid breathing. A plastic tube is placedthrough the nose or mouth into the windpipe and isattached to a machine that forces air into the lungs. Thiscan be a lifesaving treatment and should be continued untilthe patient’s own lungs can take over the work of breathing.It is very important to use no more pressure than is neces-sary to provide sufficient oxygen; otherwise ventilationmay cause further lung damage. Drugs are given to keepthe patient calm, and the amount of fluid in the body iscarefully adjusted so that the heart and lungs can functionas normally as possible. Steroids, which combat inflamma-tion, may sometimes be helpful but they can cause compli-cations, including weakening the breathing muscles.\\nThe respiratory therapist has a number of methods\\navailable to help patients overcome respiratory failure.They include:\\n• Suctioning the lungs through a small plastic tube\\npassed through the nose, in order to remove secretionsfrom the airways that the patient cannot cough up.\\n• Postural drainage, in which the patient is propped up at\\nan angle or tilted to help secretions drain out of thelungs. The therapist may clap the patient on the chest orback to loosen the secretions, or a vibrator may be usedfor the same purpose.\\n• Breathing exercises often are prescribed after the patient\\nrecovers. They make the patient feel better and help tostrengthen the muscles that aid breathing. One usefulmethod is for the patient to suck on a tube attached to aclear plastic hosing containing a ball so as to keep theball lifted. Regular deep breathing exercises are simplerand often just as helpful. Another technique is to havethe patient breathe out against pursed lips to increasepressure in the airways and keep them from collapsing.\\nPrognosis\\nThe outlook for patients with respiratory failure\\ndepends chiefly on its cause. If the underlying diseasecan be effectively treated, with the patient’s breathingsupported in the meantime, the outlook is usually good.\\nCare is needed not to expose the patient to polluting\\nsubstances in the atmosphere while recovering from res-piratory failure; this could tip the balance against recov-ery. When respiratory failure develops slowly, pressuremay build up in the lung’s blood vessels, a conditioncalled pulmonary hypertension . This condition may\\ndamage the vessels, worsen hypoxemia, and cause theheart to fail. If it is not possible to provide enough oxy-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2866Respiratory failure'),\n",

In some cases, the pri-mary disease causing the lungs to fail is irreversible. Thepatient, family, and physician together then must decidewhether to prolong life by ventilator support. Occasion-ally, lung transplantation is a possibility, but it is a\\nhighly complex procedure and is not widely available\\nPrevention\\nBecause respiratory failure is not a disease itself,\\nbut the end result of many lung disorders, the best pre-vention is to treat any lung disease promptly and effec-tively. It is also important to make sure that any patientwho has had lung disease is promptly treated for anyrespiratory infection (even of the upper respiratorytract). Patients with lung problems should also avoidexposure to pollutants, as much as is possible. Once res-piratory failure is present, it is best for a patient toreceive treatment in an intensive care unit, where spe-cialized personnel and all the needed equipment areavailable. Close supervision of treatment, especiallymechanical ventilation, will help minimize complica-tions that would compound the problem.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBerkow, Robert, ed.

Cramer, MD\\nRespiratory syncytial virus\\ninfection\\nDefinition\\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a virus that can\\ncause severe lower respiratory infections in childrenunder the age of two, and milder upper respiratory infec-tions in older children and adults. RSV infection is alsocalled bronchiolitis, because it is marked in young chil-dren by inflammation of the bronchioles. Bronchiolesare the narrow airways that lead from the bronchi to thetiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. The result is wheez-\\ning, difficulty breathing, and sometimes fatal respirato-\\nry failure .\\nDescription\\nRSV infection is caused by a group of viruses found\\nworldwide. There are two different subtypes of the viruswith numerous different strains. Taken together, theseviruses account for a significant number of deaths ininfants.\\nRSV infection is primarily a disease of winter or early\\nspring, with waves of illness sweeping through a commu-nity. The rate of RSV infection is estimated to be 11.4cases in every 100 children during their first year of life. Inthe United States, RSV infection occurs most frequently ininfants between the ages of two months and six months.\\nRSV infection shows distinctly different symptoms,\\ndepending on the age of the infected person. In childrenunder two, the virus causes a serious lower respiratoryinfection in the lungs. In older children and healthyadults, it causes a mild upper respiratory infection oftenmistaken for the common cold .\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2867Respiratory syncytial virus infection'),\n",

Breastfeeding seems to provide partial protection from thevirus. Conditions in infants that increase their risk ofinfection include:\\n• premature birth\\n• lower socio-economic environment• congenital heart disease• chronic lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis• immune system deficiencies, including HIV infection• immunosuppressive therapy given to organ transplant\\npatients\\nMany older children and adults get RSV infection,\\nbut the symptoms are so similar to the common cold thatthe true cause is undiagnosed. People of any age withweakened immune systems, either from such diseases asAIDS or leukemia, or as the result of chemotherapy or\\ncorticosteroid medications, are more at risk for seriousRSV infections. So are people with chronic lung disease.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nRespiratory syncytial virus is spread through close con-\\ntact with an infected person. It has been shown that if a per-son with RSV infection sneezes, the virus can be carried toothers within a radius of six f (1.8 m). This group of virusesis hardy. They can live on the hands for up to half an hourand on toys or other inanimate objects for several hours.\\nScientists have yet to understand why RSV viruses\\nattack the lower respiratory system in infants and theupper respiratory system in adults. In infants, RSVbegins with such cold symptoms as a low fever , runny\\nnose, and sore throat . Soon, other symptoms appear that\\nsuggest an infection which involves the lower airways.Some of these symptoms resemble those of asthma .\\nRSV infection is suggested by:\\n• wheezing and high-pitched, whistling breathing• rapid breathing (more than 40 breaths per minute)• shortness of breath• labored breathing out (exhalations)• bluish tinge to the skin (cyanosis)• croupy, seal-like, barking cough\\n• high fever\\nBreathing problems occur in RSV infections\\nbecause the bronchioles swell, making it difficult for airto get in and out of the lungs. If the child is having trou-ble breathing, immediate medical care is needed. Breath-ing problems are most common in infants under one yearof age; they can develop rapidly.Diagnosis\\nPhysical examination and imaging studies\\nRSV infection is usually diagnosed during a physi-\\ncal examination by the pediatrician or primary care\\ndoctor. The doctor listens with a stethoscope for wheez-ing and other abnormal lung sounds in the patient’schest. The doctor will also take into considerationwhether there is a known outbreak of RSV infection inthe area. Chest x rays give some indication of whetherthe lungs are hyperinflated from an effort to move air inand out. X rays may also show the presence of a sec-ondary bacterial infection, such as pneumonia .\\nLaboratory tests\\nA blood test can also detect RSV infection. This test\\nmeasures the level of antibodies the body has formedagainst the virus. The blood test is less reliable in infantsthan in older children because antibodies in the infant’sblood may have come from the mother during pregnan-\\ncy. If infants are hospitalized, other tests such as an arter-\\nial blood gas analysis are done to determine if the child\\nis receiving enough oxygen.\\nTreatment\\nHome care\\nHome treatment for RSV infection is primarily sup-\\nportive. It involves taking steps to ease the child’s breath-ing. Dehydration can be a problem, so children should\\nbe encouraged to drink plenty of fluids. Antibiotics have\\nno effect on viral illnesses. In time, the body will makeantibodies to fight the infection and return itself to health.\\nHome care for keeping a child with RSV comfort-\\nable and breathing more easily includes:\\n• Use a cool mist room humidifier to ease congestion and\\nsore throat.\\n• Raise the baby’s head by putting books under the head\\nend of the crib.\\n•G i v e  acetaminophen (Tylenol, Pandol, Tempra) for\\nfever. Aspirin should not be given to children because of\\nits association with Reye’s syndrome , a serious disease.\\n• For babies too young to blow their noses, suction away\\nany mucus with an infant nasal aspirator.\\nHospital treatment\\nIn the United States, RSV infections are responsible\\nfor 90,000 hospitalizations and 4,500 deaths each year.Children who are hospitalized receive oxygen andhumidity through a mist tent or vaporizer.

Blood gases are moni-\\ntored to assure that the child is receiving enough oxygen.\\nMedications\\nBronchiodilators, such as albuterol (Proventil, Ven-\\ntilin), may be used to keep the airways open. Ribavirin(Virazole) is used for desperately ill children to stop thegrowth of the virus. Ribavirin is both expensive and hastoxic side effects, so its use is restricted to the mostsevere cases.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative medicine has little to say specifically\\nabout bronchiolitis, especially in very young children.Practitioners emphasize that people get viral illnessesbecause their immune systems are weak. Preventionfocuses on strengthening the immune system by eating ahealthy diet low in sugars and high in fresh fruits andvegetables, reducing stress , and getting regular, moder-\\nate exercise . Like traditional practitioners, alternative\\npractitioners recommend breastfeeding infants so that thechild may benefit from the positive state of health of themother. Inhaling a steaming mixture of lemon oil, thymeoil, eucalyptus, and tea tree oil ( aromatherapy ) may\\nmake breathing easier.\\nPrognosis\\nRSV infection usually runs its course in seven to14\\ndays. The cough may linger weeks longer. There are nomedications that can speed the body’s production of anti-bodies against the virus. Opportunistic bacterial infectionsthat take advantage of a weakened respiratory system maycause ear, sinus, and throat infections or pneumonia.\\nHospitalization and death are much more likely to\\noccur in children whose immune systems are weakenedor who have underlying diseases of the lungs and heart.People do not gain permanent immunity to respiratorysyncytial virus and can be infected many times. Childrenwho suffer repeated infections seem to be more likely todevelop asthma in later life.\\nPrevention\\nAs of 1998 there are no vaccines against RSV . Res-\\npiratory syncytial virus infection is so common that pre-vention is impossible. However, steps can be taken toreduce a child’s contact with the disease. People withRSV symptoms should stay at least six feet away fromyoung children.

These sensations are felt deep withinthe legs and are described as creeping, crawling, aching,or fidgety.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2869Restless legs syndrome'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 575}, page_content='Description\\nRestless legs syndrome, also known as Ekbom syn-\\ndrome, Wittmaack-Ekbom syndrome, anxietas tibiarum ,\\nor anxietas tibialis , affects up to 10–15% of the popula-\\ntion. Some studies show that RLS is more commonamong elderly people. Almost half of patients over age60 who complain of insomnia are diagnosed with RLS.\\nIn some cases, the patient has another medical conditionwith which RLS is associated. In idiopathic RLS, nocause can be found. In familial cases, RLS may be inher-ited from a close relative, most likely a parent.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMost people experience mild symptoms. They may\\nlie down to rest at the end of the day and, just beforesleep, will experience discomfort in their legs thatprompts them to stand up, massage the leg, or walkbriefly. Eighty-five percent of RLS patients either havedifficulty falling asleep or wake several times during thenight, and almost half experience daytime fatigue or\\nsleepiness. It is common for the symptoms to be inter-mittent. They may disappear for several months and thenreturn for no apparent reason. Two-thirds of patientsreport that their symptoms become worse with time.Some older patients claim to have had symptoms sincethey were in their early 20s, but were not diagnosed untiltheir 50s. Suspected under-diagnosis of RLS may beattributed to the difficulty experienced by patients indescribing their symptoms.\\nMore than 80% of patients with RLS experience\\nperiodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS). These randommovements of arms or legs may result in further sleep dis-turbance and daytime fatigue. Most patients have restlessfeelings in both legs, but only one leg may be affected.Arms may be affected in nearly half of patients.\\nThere is no known cause for the disorder, but recent\\nresearch has focused on several key areas. These include:\\n• Central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. Several\\ntypes of drugs have been found to reduce the symptomsof RLS. Based on an understanding of how these drugswork, theories have been developed to explain thecause of the disorder. Levodopa and other drugs thatcorrect problems with signal transmission within thecentral nervous system (CNS) can reduce the symp-toms of RLS. It is therefore suspected that the source ofRLS is a problem related to signal transmission systemsin the CNS.\\n• Iron deficiency. The body stores iron in the form of fer-\\nritin. There is a relationship between low levels of iron(as ferritin) stored in the body and the occurrence ofRLS. Studies have shown that older people with RLSoften have low levels of ferritin. Supplements of iron\\nsulfate have been shown to significantly reduce RLSsymptoms for these patients.\\nDiagnosis\\nA careful history enables the physician to distinguish\\nRLS from similar types of disorders that cause night timediscomfort in the limbs, such as muscle cramps, burningfeet syndrome, and damage to nerves that detect sensa-tions or cause movement (polyneuropathy).\\nThe most important tool the doctor has in diagnosis\\nis the history obtained from the patient. There are severalcommon medical conditions that are known to eithercause or to be closely associated with RLS. The doctormay link the patient’s symptoms to one of these condi-tions, which include anemia, diabetes, disease of thespinal nerve roots (lumbosacral radiculopathy), Parkin-\\nson’s disease , late-stage pregnancy , kidney failure (ure-\\nmia), and complications of stomach surgery. In order toidentify or eliminate such a primary cause, blood testsmay be performed to determine the presence of serumiron, ferritin, folate, vitamin B\\n12, creatinine, and thyroid-\\nstimulating hormones. The physician may also ask ifsymptoms are present in any close family members,since it is common for RLS to run in families and thistype is sometimes more difficult to treat.\\nIn some cases, sleep studies such as polysomnogra-\\nphy are undertaken to identify the presence of PLMS\\nthat are reported to affect 70–80% of people who sufferfrom RLS. The patient is often unaware of these move-ments, since they may not cause him to wake. However,the presence of PLMS with RLS can leave the personmore tired, because it interferes with deep sleep. Apatient who also displays evidence of some neurologicdisease may undergo electromyography (EMG). During\\nEMG, a very small, thin needle is inserted into the mus-cle and electrical activity of the muscle is recorded. Adoctor or technician usually performs this test at a hospi-tal outpatient department.\\nTreatment\\nThe first step in treatment is to treat existing conditions\\nthat are known to be associated with RLS and that will beidentified by blood tests. If the patient is anemic, iron (ironsulfate) or vitamin supplements (folate or vitamin B\\n12) will\\nbe prescribed. If kidney disease is identified as a cause,treatment of the kidney problem will take priority.\\nPrescription drugs\\nIn some people whose symptoms cannot be linked to\\na treatable associated condition, drug therapy may be\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2870Restless legs syndrome'),\n",

Prescription drugs that are normally used forRLS include:\\n•Benzodiazepines and low-potency opioids. These\\ndrugs are prescribed for use only on an “as needed”basis, for patients with mild RLS. Benzodiazepinesappear to reduce nighttime awakenings due to PLMS.The benzodiazepine most commonly used to treat RLSis clonazepam (Klonopin, Rivotril). The main disadvan-tage of this drug type is that it causes daytime drowsi-ness. It also causes unsteadiness that may lead to acci-dents, especially for an elderly patient. Opioids are nar-cotic pain relievers. Those commonly used for mild\\nRLS are low potency opioids, such as codeine (Tylenol#3) and propoxyphene (Darvocet). Studies have shownthat these can be successfully used in the treatment ofRLS on a long-term basis without risk of addiction .\\nHowever, narcotics can cause constipation and diffi-\\nculty urinating.\\n• Levodopa (L-dopa) and carbidopa (Sinemet). Levodopa\\nis the drug most commonly used to treat moderate orsevere RLS. It acts by supplying a chemical calleddopamine to the brain. It is often taken in conjunctionwith carbidopa to prevent or decrease side effects.Although it is effective against RLS, levodopa may alsocauses a worsening of symptoms during the afternoonor early evening in 50–80% of patients. This phenome-non is known as “restless legs augmentation,” and if itoccurs, the physician will probably discontinue Lev-odopa for a brief period while an alternate drug is used.Levodopa can often be reintroduced after a short break.\\n• Pergolide (Permax). Pergolide acts on the same part of\\nthe brain as Levodopa. It is less likely than Levodopa tocause daytime worsening of symptoms (occurs in about25% of patients). However, it is not recommended asthe first choice in drug therapy since it causes a highrate of minor side effects. Pergolide is often used onlyif Levodopa has been discontinued.\\n• High potency opioids. If the symptoms of RLS are dif-\\nficult to treat with the above medication, higher doseopioids will be used. These include methadone\\n(Dolophine), oxycodone, and clonidine (Catapres,Combipres, Dixarit). A significant disadvantage ofthese drugs is risk of addiction.\\n• Anticonvulsants. Some cases of RLS may be improved\\nby anticonvulsant drugs , such as carbamazepine\\n(Tegretol).\\n• Combination therapy. Some patients respond well to\\ncombinations of drugs such as a benzodiazepine andLevodopa.Many drugs have been investigated for treatment of\\nRLS, but it seems as though the perfect therapy has notyet been found. However, careful monitoring of sideeffects and good communication between patient anddoctor can result in a flexible program of therapy thatminimizes side effects and maximizes effectiveness.\\nAlternative treatment\\nIt is likely that the best alternative therapy will com-\\nbine both conventional and alternative approaches. Lev-odopa may be combined with a therapy that relievespain, relaxes muscles, or focuses in general on the ner-vous system and the brain. Any such combined therapythat allows a reduction in dosage of levodopa is advanta-geous, since this will reduce the likelihood of unaccept-able levels of drug side effects. Of course, the physicianwho prescribes the medication should monitor any com-bined therapy. Alternative methods may include:\\n•Acupuncture . Patients who also suffer from rheuma-\\ntoid arthritis may especially benefit from acupuncture\\nto relieve RLS symptoms. Acupuncture is believed tobe effective in arthritis treatment and may also stimu-late those parts of the brain that are involved in RLS.\\n• Homeopathy. Homeopaths believe that disorders of the\\nnervous system are especially important because thebrain controls so many other bodily functions. The rem-edy is tailored to the individual patient and is based onindividual symptoms as well as the general symptomsof RLS.\\n•Reflexology . Reflexologists claim that the brain, head,\\nand spine all respond to indirect massage of specificparts of the feet.\\n• Nutritional supplements. Supplementation of the diet\\nwith vitamin E, calcium, magnesium, and folic acid\\nmay be helpful for people with RLS.\\nSome alternative methods may treat the associated\\ncondition that is suspected to cause restless legs. Theseinclude:\\n• Anemia or low ferritin levels. Chinese medicine will\\nemphasize stimulation of the spleen as a means ofimproving blood circulation and vitamin absorption.Other treatments may include acupuncture and herbaltherapies, such as ginseng ( Panax ginseng ) for anemia-\\nrelated fatigue.\\n• Late-stage pregnancy. There are few conventional ther-\\napies available to pregnant women, since most of thedrugs prescribed are not recommended for use duringpregnancy. Pregnant women may benefit from alterna-tive techniques that focus on body work, includingyoga , reflexology, and acupuncture.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2871Restless legs syndrome'),\n",

It may remain static, although two-thirdsof patients get worse with time. The symptoms usuallyprogress gradually. Treatment with Levodopa is effectivein moderate to severe cases that may include significantPLMS. However, this drug produces significant sideeffects, and continued successful treatment may depend oncarefully monitored use of combination drug therapy. Theprognosis is usually best if RLS symptoms are recent andcan be traced to another treatable condition that is associ-ated with RLS. Some associated conditions are not treat-able.

Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a form of cardiomy-opathy in which the walls of the heart become rigid.\\nDescription\\nRestrictive cardiomyopathy is the least common\\ntype of cardiomyopathy in the United States. The stiff-ened heart walls cannot stretch properly to allow enoughblood to fill the ventricles between heartbeats. As thestiffening worsens, heart failure occurs. The blood\\nbacks up into the blood vessels, causing fluid buildup intissues (congestion and edema ).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nRestrictive cardiomyopathy can be caused by a num-\\nber of diseases. Often, the cause is unknown. The rigidityof the heart walls may be caused by fibrosis, the replace-ment of muscle cells with tough, fibrous tissue. In somedisorders, proteins and other substances are deposited inthe heart wall. Amyloidosis is the accumulation of a pro-\\ntein material, called amyloid, in the tissue of the heart\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2872Restrictive cardiomyopathy'),\n",

In hemochromatosis , there is too\\nmuch iron in the body and some of the excess iron canbuild up in the heart. Sarcoidosis causes the formation of\\nmany small lesions, called granulomas, in the heart walland other tissues of the body. These granulomas containinflammatory white blood cells and other cells thatdecrease the flexibility of the heart.\\nPeople with restrictive cardiomyopathy usually feel\\ntired and weak, and have shortness of breath , especially\\nduring exercise . If blood is backing up in the circulation\\nthey may also experience edema (large amounts of fluidin tissues) of the legs and feet.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis is usually based on a physical exami-\\nnation ,echocardiography , and other tests as needed.\\nThe physician listens to the heart with a stethoscope todetect abnormal heart rhythms and heart sounds.\\nEchocardiography uses sound waves to make\\nimages of the heart. These images provide informationabout the structures of the heart and its heart valves.Echocardiography can also be used to find out how muchblood the heart is pumping. It determines the amount ofblood in the ventricle, called the ventricular volume, andthe amount of blood the ventricle pumps each time itbeats, called the ejection fraction. A healthy heart pumpsat least one half the amount of blood in the left ventriclewith each heartbeat.\\nComputed tomography scan (CT scan) and magnet-\\nic resonance imaging (MRI) are imaging tests that can\\nalso provide information about the structure of the heart.However, these tests are rarely needed for diagnosis.\\nCardiac catheterization may be needed to confirm\\na diagnosis or cause. In cardiac catheterization, a smalltube called a catheter is inserted into an artery and passedinto the heart. It is used to measure pressure in the heartand the amount of blood pumped by the heart. A smalltissue sample (biopsy) of the heart muscle can beremoved through the catheter for microscopic examina-tion. Fibrous tissue or deposits in the heart muscle can beidentified in this biopsy.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no effective treatment for restrictive car-\\ndiomyopathy. Treatment of a causative disease mayreduce or stop the damage to the heart, but existing dam-age cannot be reversed. Medications may be used tolessen the workload on the heart and to control the heartrhythm. Drugs normally used to treat other types of car-diomyopathy and heart failure may cause problems forpatients with restrictive cardiomyopathy.

Also, medicines may relieve symptoms.However, for most patients, restrictive cardiomyopathyeventually causes heart failure.

A reticulocyte count is usually performedwhen patients are evaluated for anemia and response toits treatment. It is sometimes called a retic count.\\nPurpose\\nDiagnosis\\nA reticulocyte count provides information about the\\nrate at which the bone marrow is producing red cells. Anormal count means that the production is adequate; adecreased count means it is not. This information helpsdetermine whether a lack of red cells in an anemic personis caused by a bone marrow problem, by excessive bleed-ing, or by red cell destruction.\\nMonitoring\\nThe test is also used to monitor the response of bone\\nmarrow response to treatment for anemia. The reticulo-cyte count rises within days if the treatment is successful.It is also used following bone marrow transplant to eval-uate the new marrow’s cell production.\\nDescription\\nReticulocytes were first described as transitional\\nforms of red blood cells by Wilhelm H. Erb in 1865. Ared cell begins in the bone marrow as a large bluish cellfilled with ribonucleic acid (RNA). As the cell matures, itshrinks. Its color gradually changes from blue to pink asits load of oxygen-carrying protein (hemoglobin)increases and the RNA decreases. The center of the cell(nucleus) becomes clumped. It is expelled three daysbefore the cell leaves the bone marrow. The cell is now areticulocyte. On its fourth and final day of maturation,the reticulocyte enters the bloodstream. One day later, itis a mature red blood cell.\\nThe first step in a retic count is drawing the patient’s\\nblood sample. About 17 oz (5 ml) of blood is withdrawnfrom a vein into a vacuum tube. The procedure, which iscalled a venipuncture, takes about five minutes.\\nAfter the sample is collected, the blood is mixed with\\na dye (methylene blue) in a test tube. The RNA remainingin the reticulocytes picks up a deep blue stain. Drops ofthe mixture are smeared on slides and examined under amicroscope. Reticulocytes appear as cells containing darkblue granules or a blue network. The laboratory technolo-gist counts 1,000 red cells, keeping track of the number ofreticulocytes. The number of reticulocytes is reported as apercentage of the total red cells. When the red cell countis low, the percentage of reticulocytes is inaccuratelyhigh, suggesting that more reticulocytes are present thanthere are in reality. The percentage is mathematically cor-rected for greater accuracy. This figure is called the cor-rected reticulocyte count or reticulocyte index.\\nReticulocyte counts can also be done on automated\\ninstruments, such as flow cytometers, using fluorescentstains. These instruments are able to detect smallchanges in the reticulocyte count because they count alarger number of cells (10,000–50,000).\\nPreparation\\nThe doctor should make a note of any prescription\\nmedications that the patient is taking. Some drugs lowerthe red blood cell count.\\nAftercare\\nAftercare consists of routine care of the area around\\nthe puncture mark. Pressure is applied for a few secondsand the wound is covered with a bandage.\\nRisks\\nThe primary risk is mild dizziness and the possibili-\\nty of a bruise or swelling in the area where the blood wasdrawn. The patient can apply moist warm compresses.\\nNormal results\\nAdults have reticulocyte counts of 0.5–2.5%.\\nWomen and children usually have higher reticulocytecounts than men.\\nAbnormal results\\nA low reticulocyte count indicates that the bone\\nmarrow is not producing a normal number of red blood\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2874Reticulocyte count'),\n",

Nordenson\\nRetinal artery occlusion\\nDefinition\\nRetinal artery occlusion refers to the closure of the\\ncentral retinal artery and usually results in complete lossof vision in one eye. Occlusion of its branches causesloss of vision in only a portion of the field of vision.\\nDescription\\nRetinal artery occlusion (RAO) occurs when the\\ncentral retinal artery, the main source of blood supply tothe retina, or one of its branches becomes blocked.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe main causes of RAO are the following:\\n• embolism (the sudden obstruction of a blood vessel by\\na blood clot)\\n• atherosclerotic disease that results in the progressive\\nnarrowing of the arteries over time\\n• endarteritis (the chronic inflammation of the inner layer\\nof arteries)KEY TERMS\\nAnemia —A condition marked by a decrease in the\\nnumber or size of red blood cells\\nMethylene blue —A dye that is used to stain the\\nblood cells for the reticulocyte count.\\nReticulocyte —An immature red blood cell.• angiospasm (a spasmodic contraction of a blood vessel\\nwith increase in blood pressure)\\nThe most common symptom of RAO is an acute,\\npainless loss of vision in one eye. The degree of lossdepends on the location of the occlusion. If the occlusionoccurs in the central artery of the retina, damage usuallyresults in complete loss of vision in the affected eye. Ifocclusion occurs in a branch artery, vision loss will bepartial and may even go unnoticed if only a section of theperipheral vision is affected.\\nPeople affected by RAO typically have high blood\\npressure, heart disease, or diabetes as an underlying con-dition. Other conditions that may increase the risk ofRAO include high cholesterol and glaucoma . Inci-\\ndence is slightly more common in men and in people age60 or older.\\nDiagnosis\\nRAO is diagnosed by examination of the retina with\\nan ophtalmoscope.\\nTreatment\\nCentral retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is an emer-\\ngency. If treatment begins within an hour, the patient hasthe highest possibility of regaining vision in the affectedeye, although complete restoration is unlikely.\\nA common treatment is inhalation of carbon dioxide\\nso as to dilate the retinal vessels and move the occlusionfrom the central retinal artery to a branch artery. Thismovement reduces the area of the retina affected andmay restore a certain amount of vision. Eyeball massagemay also be performed, also in an effort to remove theocclusion. The physician may also consider puncturingthe eyeball.\\nDrug therapy includes the use of carbonic anhydrase\\ninhibitors to reduce the internal eye pressure and enhancemovement of the occlusion.

In other words, the moving away ofthe retina from the outer wall of the eyeball.\\nDescription\\nThere are three layers of the eyeball. The outer,\\ntough, white sclera. Lining the sclera is the choroid, athin membrane that supplies nutrients to part of the reti-na. The innermost layer is the retina.\\nThe retina is the light-sensitive membrane that\\nreceives images and transmits them to the brain. It ismade up of several layers. One layer contains the pho-toreceptors. The photoreceptors, the rods and cones, sendthe visual message to the brain. Between the photorecep-tor layer (also called the sensory layer) and the choroid isthe pigmented epithelium.\\nThe vitreous is a clear gel-like substance that fills up\\nmost of the inner space of the eyeball. It lies behind thelens and is in contact with the retina.\\nA retinal detachment occurs between the two outer-\\nmost layers of the retina—the photoreceptor layer andthe outermost pigmented epithelium. Because thechoroid supplies the photoreceptors with nutrients, adetachment can basically starve the photoreceptors. If adetachment is not repaired within 24–72 hours, perma-nent damage may occur.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSeveral conditions may cause retinal detachment:\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2876Retinal detachment'),\n",

This occurs\\nmore often in the elderly or in very nearsighted (myopic)eyes.\\n• Cataract surgery causes retinal detachment 2% of the\\ntime.\\n• Tumors can cause the retina to detach.\\nRetinal detachment will cause a sudden defect in\\nvision. It may look as if a curtain or shadow has justdescended before the eye. If most of the retina is detached,there may be only a small hole of vision remaining. If justa part of the retina is involved, there will be a blind spotthat may not even be noticed. It is often associated withfloaters —little dark spots that float across the eye and can\\nbe mistaken for flies in the room. There may also be flash-\\nesof light. Anyone experiencing a sudden onset of flashes\\nand/or floaters should contact their eye doctor immediate-ly, as this may signal a detachment.\\nDiagnosis\\nIf the eye is clear—that is, if there is no clouding of\\nthe liquids inside the eye—the detachment can be seenby looking into the eye with a hand-held instrumentcalled an ophthalmoscope. To evaluate the blood vesselsin the retina, a fluorescent dye (fluorescein) may be\\ninjected into a vein and photographed with ultravioletlight as it passes through the retina. Further studies mayinclude computed tomography scan (CT scan), magnet-\\nic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound study. Other\\nlenses may be used to examine the back of the eyes. Oneexample is binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy. The doc-tor dilates the patient’s eyes with eyedrops and thenexamines the back of the eyes with a hand-held lens.\\nTreatment\\nReattaching the retina to the inner surface of the eye\\nrequires making a scar that will hold it in place and thenbringing the retina close to the scarred area. The scar can bemade from the outside, through the sclera, using either alaser or a freezing cold probe (cryopexy). Bringing the reti-na close to the scar can be done in two ways. A tiny belttightened around the eyeball will bring the sclera in until itreaches the retina. This procedure is called scleral bucklingand may be done under general anesthesia. Using this pro-cedure permits the repair of retinal detachments withoutentering the eyeball. Sometimes, the eye must be entered topump in air or gas, forcing the retina outward against thesclera and its scar. This is called pneumatic retinopexy andcan generally be done under local anesthesia.\\nIf all else fails, and especially if there is disease in\\nthe vitreous, the vitreous may have to be removed in aprocedure called vitrectomy . This can be done through\\ntiny holes in the eye, through which equally tiny instru-ments are placed to suck out the vitreous and replace itwith saline, a salt solution. The procedure must maintainpressure inside the eye so that the eye does not collapse.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2877Retinal detachment\\nCornea\\nLens\\nRetina\\nSclera\\nNormal eyeDetached retinaVitreous\\nhumor\\nRetinal detachment refers to the movement of the retina away from the inner wall of the eyeball, resulting in a sudden defect\\nin vision.

Early treatment can prevent both progressing todetachment and blindness from other events like hemor-rhage. The most common problem is weakness of bloodvessels that causes them to break down and bleed. Whenenough vessels have been damaged, new vessels grow toreplace them. These new vessels may grow into the vitre-ous, producing blind spots and scarring. The scarring canin turn pull the retina loose. Other diseases can cause thetiny holes and tears in the retina through which fluid canleak. Preventive treatment uses a laser to cauterize theblood vessels, so that they do not bleed and the holes, sothey do not leak.\\nGood control of diabetes can help prevent diabetic\\neye disease.

RVO may be categorizedby the anatomy of the occluded vein and the degree ofischemia produced. The two major RVO types are central\\nretinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and branch retinal veinocclusion (BRVO). CRVO has been diagnosed in patientsas young as nine months to patients of 90 years. The age ofaffected individuals is usually low to mid 60s. Approxi-mately 90% of patients are over 50 at the time of diagno-sis, with 57% of them being male and 43% being female.BRVO accounts for some 30% of all vein occlusions.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCRVO is a painless loss of vision that can be caused\\nby a swollen optic disk, the small area in the retina wherethe optic nerve enters the eye, by dilated retinal veins,and by retinal hemorrhages. CRVO is also called venousstasis retinopathy, or hemorrhagic retinopathy.\\nIn BRVO, the superotemporal branch vein is the\\nmost often affected vessel. Retinal hemorrhages follows,often occurring at the crossing of two vessels near theoptic disk. Initially the hemorrhage may be extensive andunderlie the fovea.\\nThe exact cause of RVO is not yet identified, but the\\nfollowing mechanisms been proposed:\\n• external compression between the central connective\\nstrand and the cribriform plate\\n• venous disease• blood clot formation\\nConditions associated with RVO risk include:\\n• hypertension\\n• hyperlipidemia• diabetes mellitus\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2878Retinal vein occlusion'),\n",

Saunders Co., 1999.\\nMichael Sherwin Walston\\nRonald Watson, PhD\\nRetinitis pigmentosa\\nDefinition\\nRetinitis pigmentosa (RP) refers to a group of inherited\\ndisorders that slowly leads to blindness due to abnormalitiesof the photoreceptors (primarily the rods) in the retina.\\nDescription\\nThe retina lines the interior surface of the back of\\nthe eye. The retina is made up of several layers. Onelayer contains two types of photoreceptor cells referredto as the rods and cones. The cones are responsible forsharp, central vision and color vision and are primarilylocated in a small area of the retina called the fovea. Thearea surrounding the fovea contains the rods, which arenecessary for peripheral vision and night vision (scotopicvision). The number of rods increases in the periphery.The rod and cone photoreceptors convert light into elec-trical impulses and send the message to the brain via theoptic nerve. Another layer of the retina, called the retinalpigmented epithelium (RPE), may also be affected.\\nIn RP, the photoreceptors (primarily the rods) begin to\\ndeteriorate and lose their ability to function. Because therods are primarily affected, it becomes harder to see in dimlight, thus causing a loss of night vision. As the conditionworsens, peripheral vision disappears, which results intunnel vision. The ability to see color is eventually lost. Inthe late stages of the disease, there is only a small area ofcentral vision remaining. Ultimately, this too is lost.\\nThere are many forms of retinitis pigmentosa.\\nSometimes the disorder is classified by the age of onsetor the inheritance pattern. RP can also accompany otherconditions. This entry discusses “non-syndromic” RP,the type that is not associated with other organ or tissuedysfunction.\\nThe prevalence of RP is approximately one out of\\nevery 4,000 people in the United States and Europe. Forother parts of the world, there are no published data. Nor isthere any known ethnic difference in the occurrence of RP.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nRetinitis pigmentosa is an inherited disease that has\\nmany different modes of inheritance. RP, with any inheri-tance pattern, may be either familial (multiple familymembers affected) or isolated (only one affected person).In the non-sex-linked, or autosomal, form, it can either bea dominant or recessive trait. In the sex-linked form,called x-linked recessive, it is a recessive trait. This x-linked form is more severe than the autosomal forms. Tworare forms of RP are the digenic and mitochondrial forms.\\nIsolated RP cases represent 10–40% of all cases.\\nSome of these cases may be the result of new gene muta-tions (changes in the genes). Other isolated cases arethose in which the person has a relative with a mutation inthe gene, but the relative is not affected by the condition.\\nAutosomal dominant RP (AdRP) occurs in about\\n15–25% of affected individuals. At least 12 differentgenes have been identified as causing AdRP. People withAdRP will usually have an affected parent. The risk foraffected siblings or children is 50%.\\nAutosomal recessive RP (ArRP) occurs in about\\n5–20% of affected individuals. More than 16 genes havebeen identified that cause this type of RP. In ArRP, eachparent of the affected person is a carrier of an abnormalgene that causes RP. Neither of these carrier parents isaffected. There is a two-thirds chance that an unaffectedsibling is a carrier of RP. All of the children of an affect-ed person would be a carrier of the ArRP gene.\\nFive to 15% of individuals with RP have x-linked\\nrecessive RP (XLRP). Six different genes have beenidentified as the cause of this type of RP. Usually in thistype of inheritance, males are affected carriers, whilefemales are unaffected carriers or have a milder form ofthe disease. The mother may be a carrier of the mutationon the X-chromosome. It is also possible that a newmutation can occur for the first time in an affected per-son. For families with one affected male, there is a math-ematical formula called the Baysean analysis that can beapplied to the family history. It takes into account thenumber of unaffected males to determine whether afemale is likely to be a carrier or not. If a mother is a car-rier, her children have a 50% chance of inheriting the RPgene. For affected males, all of their daughters will becarriers but none of their sons will be affected.\\nThe digenic form of RP occurs when the affected per-\\nson has inherited one copy of an altered ROM1 gene fromone parent and one copy of an altered peripherin/RDSgene from the other parent. The parents are asymptomatic.Mitochondrial inheritance occurs when the gene mutationis in a mitochondrial gene. People with this type of RPhave progressive hearing loss and mild myopathy. Both\\nof these types of RP are very rare.\\nThe first symptoms, a loss of night vision followed\\nby a loss of peripheral vision, usually begin in early ado-lescence or young adulthood. Occasionally, the loss of\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2880Retinitis pigmentosa'),\n",

Another possible symptom is seeing twinklinglights or small flashes of lights.\\nDiagnosis\\nWhen a person complains of a loss of night vision, a\\ndoctor will examine the interior of the eye with an oph-thalmoscope to determine if there are changes in the reti-na. For people with advanced RP, the condition is charac-terized by the presence of clumps of black pigment in theinner retina (intraretinal). However, the appearance of theretina is not enough for an RP diagnosis since there areother disorders that may give the retina a similar appear-ance. There are also other reasons someone may havenight blindness. Consequently, certain electrodiagnostictests must be performed. An electroretinogram (ERG)determines the functional status of the photoreceptors byexposing the retina to light. The ERG uses a contact lensin the eye, and the output is measured on a special instru-ment called an oscilloscope. The functional assessmentsof visual fields, visual acuity, or color vision may also beperformed.\\nThe diagnosis of RP can be established when the\\nfollowing criteria are met:\\n• rod dysfunction measured by dark adaptation test or\\nERG,\\n• progressive loss in photoreceptor function,\\n• loss of peripheral (side) vision,• both eyes affected (bilaterality).\\nMolecular genetic testing is available on a research\\nbasis. Prenatal diagnosis for this condition has not yetbeen achieved.\\nTreatment\\nThere are no medications or surgery to treat RP.\\nSome doctors believe vitamins A and E will slightly\\nslow the progression of the disease in some people. How-ever, large doses of certain vitamins may be toxic andaffected individuals should speak to their doctors beforetaking supplements.\\nIf a person with RP must be exposed to bright sun-\\nlight, some doctors recommend wearing dark sunglassesto reduce the effect on the retina. Affected people shouldtalk to their eye doctors about the correct lenses to wearoutdoors.\\nBecause there is no cure for RP, the affected person\\nshould be monitored for visual function and counseledabout low-vision aids (for example, field-expansiondevices). Genetic counseling is also appropriate. Athree-generation family history with attention to other\\nrelatives with possible RP can help to clarify the inheri-tance pattern. For some people however, the inheritancepattern cannot be discerned.\\nPrognosis\\nThere is no known cure for RP, which will eventual-\\nly lead to blindness. The more severe forms will lead toblindness sooner than milder forms.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nNewell, Frank W. Ophthalmology: Principles and Concepts ,\\n7th ed.

The sclera is the outer protective white coatingof the eye. The choroid is the middle layer and containsblood vessels that nourish the eye. The front portion ofthe choroid is colored and is called the iris. The openingin the iris is called the pupil. The pupil is responsible forallowing light into the eye and usually appears black.When the pupil is exposed to bright light it contracts(closes), and when it is exposed to low light conditions itdilates (opens) so that the appropriate amount of lightenters the eye. Light that enters through the pupil hits thelens of the eye. The lens then focuses the light onto theretina, the innermost of the three layers. The job of theretina is to transform the light into information that canbe transmitted to the optic nerve, which will transmit thisinformation to the brain. It is through this process thatpeople are able to see the world around them.\\nOccasionally a tumor, called a retinoblastoma, will\\ndevelop in the retina of the eye. Usually this tumor formsin young children but it can occasionally occur in adults.Most people with retinoblastoma develop only one tumor(unifocal) in only one eye (unilateral). Some, however,develop multiple tumors (multifocal) in one or both eyes.When retinoblastoma occurs independently in both eyes,it is then called bilateral retinoblastoma.KEY TERMS\\nOphthalmoscope —An instrument, with special\\nlighting, designed to view structures in the back ofthe eye.Occasionally, children with retinoblastoma develop\\ntrilateral retinoblastoma. Trilateral retinoblastoma resultsfrom the development of an independent brain tumor\\nthat often forms in a part of the brain called the pinealgland. In order for retinoblastoma to be classified as tri-lateral retinoblastoma, the tumor must have developedindependently and not as the result of the spread of theretinal cancer . The prognosis for trilateral retinoblas-\\ntoma is quite poor.\\nThe retinal tumor which characterizes retinoblas-\\ntoma is malignant, meaning that it can metastasize(spread) to other parts of the eye and eventually otherparts of the body. In most cases, however, retinoblastomais diagnosed before it spreads past the eye to other partsof the body (intraocular) and the prognosis is quite good.The prognosis is poorer if the cancer has spread beyondthe eye (extraocular).\\nRetinoblastoma can be inherited or can arise sponta-\\nneously. Approximately 40% of people with retinoblas-toma have an inherited form of the condition and approxi-mately 60% have a sporadic (not inherited) form. Individ-uals with multiple independent tumors, bilateral retino-blastoma, or trilateral retinoblastoma are more likely to beaffected with the inherited form of retinoblastoma.\\nApproximately one in 15,000 to one in 30,000\\ninfants are born with retinoblastoma, making it the mostcommon childhood eye cancer . It is, however, a relative-\\nly rare childhood cancer and accounts for approximately3% of childhood cancers. Retinoblastoma is found mainlyin children under the age of five but can occasionally beseen in older children and adults. Retinoblastoma is foundin individuals of all ethnic backgrounds and is foundequally frequently in males and females.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nRetinoblastoma is caused by changes in or absence of a\\ngene called RB1. RB1 is located on chromosome 13. Cellsof the body, with the exception of the egg and sperm cells,contain 23 pairs of chromosomes. All of the cells of thebody excluding the egg and the sperm cells are called thesomatic cells. The somatic cells contain two of each chro-mosome 13 and therefore two copies of the RB1 gene. Eachegg and sperm cell only contains one copy of chromosomeand therefore only one copy of the RB1 gene.\\nRB1 produces a tumor suppressor protein that nor-\\nmally helps to regulate the cell cycle of cells such asthose of the retina. A normal cell of the retina goesthrough a growth cycle during which it produces newcells. Genes such as tumor suppressor genes tightly regu-late this growth cycle.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2882Retinoblastoma'),\n",

Malig-nant (cancerous) tumors can spread to other parts of thebody. A malignant tumor of the retina (retinoblastoma)can result when just one retinal cell looses control of itcell cycle and replicates out of control.\\nNormally the tumor suppressor protein produced by\\nRB1 prevents a retinal cell from becoming cancerous.Each RB1 gene produces tumor suppressor protein. Onlyone functioning RB1 gene in a retinal cell is necessary toprevent the cell from becoming cancerous. If both RB1genes in a retinal cell become non-functional, then a reti-nal cell can become cancerous and retinoblastoma canresult. An RB1 gene is non-functional when it is changedor missing (deleted) and no longer produces normaltumor suppressor protein.\\nApproximately 40% of people with retinoblastoma\\nhave inherited a non-functional or deleted RB1 gene fromeither their mother or father. Therefore, they have achanged/deleted RB1 gene in every somatic cell. A per-son with an inherited missing or non-functional RB1 genewill develop a retinal tumor if the remaining RB1 genebecomes changed or deleted in a retinal cell. The remain-ing RB1 gene can become non-functional when exposedto environmental triggers such as chemicals and radiation.In most cases, however, the triggers are unknown.Approximately 90% of people who inherit a changed ormissing RB1 gene will develop retinoblastoma.\\nPeople with an inherited form of retinoblastoma are\\nmore likely to have a tumor in both eyes (bilateral) andare more likely to have more than one independent tumor(multifocal) in one or both eyes. The average age of onsetfor the inherited form of retinoblastoma is one year,which is earlier than the sporadic form of retinoblastoma.Although most people with the inherited form ofretinoblastoma develop bilateral tumors, approximately15% of people with a tumor in only one eye (unilateral)are affected with an inherited form of retinoblastoma.\\nA person with an inherited missing or non-function-\\nal RB1 gene has a 50% chance of passing on this abnor-mal gene to his or her offspring. The chance that theirchildren will inherit the changed/deleted gene and actual-ly develop retinoblastoma is approximately 45%.\\nSome people with retinoblastoma have inherited a\\nnon-functioning or missing RB1 gene from either theirmother or father even though their parents have neverdeveloped retinoblastoma. It is possible that one parenthas a changed or missing RB1 gene in every somatic cellbut has not developed retinoblastoma because theirremaining RB1 gene has remained functional. It is also\\npossible that the parent had developed a retinal tumorthat was destroyed by the body. In other cases, one parenthas two normal RB1 genes in every somatic cell, butsome of their egg or sperm cells contain a changed ormissing RB1 gene. This is called gonadal mosaicism.\\nRetinoblastoma can also result when both RB1 genes\\nbecome spontaneously changed or deleted in a retinal cellbut the RB1 genes are normal in all the other cells of thebody. Approximately 60% of people with retinoblastomahave this type of disease, called sporadic retinoblastoma. Aperson with sporadic retinoblastoma does not have a higherchance of having children with the disease. Their relativesdo not have a higher risk of developing retinoblastomathemselves or having children who develop retinoblastoma.Sporadic retinoblastoma is usually unifocal and has anaverage age of onset of approximately two years.\\nSymptoms\\nThe most common symptom of retinoblastoma is\\nleukocoria. Leukocoria results when the pupil reflects awhite color rather than the normal black or red color thatis seen on a flash photograph. It is often most obvious inflash photographs; since the pupil is exposed to a lot oflight and the duration of the exposure is so short, thepupil does not have time to constrict. Children withretinoblastoma can also have problems seeing and thiscan cause them to appear cross-eyed ( strabismus ). Peo-\\nple with retinoblastoma may also experience red, painful,and irritated eyes, inflamed tissue around the eye,enlarged pupils, and possibly different-colored eyes.\\nDiagnosis\\nChildren who have symptoms of retinoblastoma are\\nusually first evaluated by their pediatrician. The pediatri-cian will often perform a red reflex test to diagnose orconfirm leukocoria. Prior to this test the doctor insertsmedicated eye drops into the child’s eyes so that thepupils will remain dilated and not contract when exposedto bright light. The doctor then examines the eyes with anophthalmoscope, which shines a bright light into the eyesand allows the doctor to check for leukocoria. Leukoco-ria can also be diagnosed by taking a flash Polaroid pho-tograph of a patient who has been in a dark room forthree to five minutes.\\nIf the pediatrician suspects retinoblastoma on the\\nbasis of these evaluations, he or she will most likely referthe patient to an ophthalmologist (eye doctor) who hasexperience with retinoblastoma. The ophthalmologistwill examine the eye using an indirect ophthalmoscope.The opthalmoscope shines a bright light into the eye,which helps the doctor to visualize the retina. This evalu-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2883Retinoblastoma'),\n",

A metal clip is used to keep the eyes openduring the evaluation. During the examination, a cottonswab or a metal instrument with a flattened tip is used topress on the outer lens of the eye so that a better view ofthe front areas of the retina can be obtained. Sketches orphotographs of the tumor as seen through the ophthalmo-scope are taken during the procedure.\\nAn ultrasound evaluation is used to confirm the\\npresence of the tumor and to evaluate its size. Computedtomography (CT scan) is used to determine whether thetumor has spread outside of the eye and to the brain.Sometimes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also\\nused to look at the eyes, eye sockets, and the brain to seeif the cancer has spread.\\nIn most cases the cancer has not spread beyond the\\neye, and other evaluations are unnecessary. If the cancerappears to have spread beyond the eye, then other assess-ments such as a blood test, spinal tap (lumbar puncture),and/or bone marrow biopsy may be recommended. Dur-ing a spinal tap, a needle is inserted between the verte-brae of the spinal column and a small sample of the fluidsurrounding the spinal cord is obtained. In a bone mar-row biopsy, a small amount of tissue (bone marrow) istaken from inside the hip or breast bone for examination.\\nGenetic testing\\nEstablishing whether someone is affected with an\\ninherited or non-inherited form of retinoblastoma canhelp to ascertain whether other family members such assiblings, cousins, and offspring are at increased risk fordeveloping retinoblastoma. It can also sometimes helpguide treatment choices, since patients with an inheritedform of retinoblastoma may be at increased risk fordeveloping recurrent tumors or other types of cancers,particularly when treated with radiation. It is helpful forthe families of a child diagnosed with retinoblastoma tomeet with a genetic specialist such as a genetic counselorand/or geneticist. These specialists can help to ascertainthe chances that the retinoblastoma is inherited and facil-itate genetic testing if desired.\\nIf a patient with unilateral or bilateral retinoblastoma\\nhas a relative or relatives with retinoblastoma, it can beassumed that they have an inherited form of retinoblas-toma. However, it cannot be assumed that a patient with-out a family history of the disease has a sporadic form.\\nEven when there is no family history, most cases of\\nbilateral and trilateral retinoblastoma are inherited, as aremost cases of unilateral, multifocal retinoblastoma.However, only 15% of unilateral, unifocal retinoblas-\\ntoma cases are inherited.\\nThe only way to establish whether someone has an\\ninherited form of retinoblastoma is to see if theretinoblastoma gene is changed or deleted in the bloodcells obtained from a blood sample. Approximately5–8% of individuals with retinoblastoma possess a chro-mosomal abnormality involving the RB1 gene that canbe detected by looking at their chromosomes under themicroscope. The chromosomes can be seen by obtaininga blood sample. If this type of chromosomal abnormalityis detected in a child, then analysis of the parents’ chro-mosomes should be performed. If one of the parents pos-sesses a chromosomal abnormality, then they are at high-er risk for having other offspring with retinoblastoma.Chromosome testing would be recommended for theblood relatives of the parent with the abnormality.\\nUsually, however, a chromosomal abnormality is not\\ndetected in a child with retinoblastoma. In this case, spe-cialized DNA tests that look for small RB1 gene changesneed to be performed on the blood cells. DNA testing canbe difficult, time consuming, and expensive, since thereare many possible RB1 gene changes that can cause thegene to become nonfunctional.\\nIf a sample of tumor is available, then it is recom-\\nmended that DNA testing be performed on the tumorcells prior to DNA testing of the blood cells. This testingcan usually identify the gene changes/deletions in theRB1 genes that caused the tumor to develop. In somecases, RB1 gene changes/deletions are not found in thetumor cells (as of 2001, approximately 20% of RB1 genechanges or deletions are not detectable). In these cases,DNA testing of the blood cells will not be able to ascer-tain whether someone is affected with an inherited ornon-inherited form of retinoblastoma.\\nIf the changes in both RB1 genes are detected in the\\ntumor cell, then these same changes can be looked for inthe blood cells. If an RB1 gene is deleted or changed inall of the blood cells tested, the patient can be assumed tohave been born with a changed/deleted RB1 gene in all oftheir cells. This person has a 50% chance of passing theRB1 gene change/deletion on to his or her children. Mostof the time, this change/deletion has been inherited from aparent. Occasionally the gene change/deletion occurredspontaneously in the original cell that was formed whenthe egg and sperm came together at conception (de novo).\\nIf an RB1 gene change/deletion is found in all of the\\nblood cells tested, both parents should undergo blood test-ing to check for the same RB1 gene change/deletion. Ifthe RB1 gene change/deletion is identified in one of theparents, it can be assumed that the retinoblastoma wasinherited and that siblings have a 50% chance of inherit-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2884Retinoblastoma'),\n",

More distant blood relatives of the\\nparent with the identified RB1 gene change/deletion mayalso be at risk for developing retinoblastoma. Siblings andother relatives could undergo DNA testing to see if theyhave inherited the RB1 gene change/deletion.\\nIf the RB1 gene change/deletion is not identified in\\neither parent, then the results can be more difficult tointerpret. In this case, there is a 90–94% chance that theretinoblastoma was not inherited.\\nIn some cases, a person with retinoblastoma will\\nhave an RB1 gene change/deletion detected in some oftheir blood cells and not others. It can be assumed thatthis person did not inherit the retinoblastoma from eitherparent. Siblings and other relatives would therefore notbe at increased risk for developing retinoblastoma. Off-spring would be at increased risk since some of the eggor sperm cells could have the changed/deleted RB1 gene.The risks to offspring would probably be less than 50%.\\nIn families where there are multiple family members\\naffected with retinoblastoma, blood samples from multi-ple family members are often analyzed and comparedthrough DNA testing. Ninety-five percent of the time,this type of analysis is able to detect patterns in the DNAthat are associated with a changed RB1 gene in that par-ticular family. When a pattern is detected, at-risk rela-tives can be tested to establish whether they have inherit-ed an RB1 gene change/deletion.\\nPRENATAL TESTING. If chromosome or DNA testing\\nidentifies an RB1 gene/deletion in someone’s blood cells,then prenatal testing can be performed on this person’soffspring. An amniocentesis or chorionic villus sam-\\npling can be used to obtain fetal cells which can be ana-\\nlyzed for the RB1 gene change/deletion or chromosomalabnormality.\\nTreatment\\nA number of different classification (staging) sys-\\ntems are used to establish the severity of retinoblastomaand aid in choosing an appropriate treatment plan. Themost widely used staging system is the Reese-Ellsworthsystem. This system is used to classify intraoculartumors and predict which tumors are favorable enoughthat sight can be maintained. The Reese-Ellsworth classi-fication system is divided into:\\n• Group I (very favorable for maintenance of sight):\\nsmall solitary or multiple tumors, less than 6.4 mm insize (1 inch = 25.4 mm), located at or below the equatorof the eye\\n• Group II (favorable for maintenance of sight): solitary\\nor multiple tumors, 6.4mm–16 mm in size, located at orbehind the equator of the eye• Group III (possible for maintenance of sight): any\\ntumor located in front of the equator of the eye, or asolitary tumor larger than 16 mm in size and locatedbehind the equator of the eye\\n• Group IV (unfavorable for maintenance of sight): mul-\\ntiple tumors, some larger than 16 mm in size, or anytumor extending in front of the outer rim of the retina(ora serrata)\\n• Group V (very unfavorable for maintenance of sight):\\nlarge tumors involving more than half of the retina, orvitreous seeding, in which small pieces of tumor arebroken off and floating around the inside of the eye\\nWhen choosing a treatment plan, the first impor-\\ntant criteria to ascertain is whether the cancer is local-ized within the eye (intralocular) or has spread to otherparts of the body (extralocular). An intraocular\\nretinoblastoma may only involve the retina or couldinvolve other parts of the eye. An extraocular retinoblas-toma could involve only the tissues around the eye orcould result from the spread of cancer to the brain orother parts of the body.\\nIt is also important to establish whether the cancer is\\nunilateral (one eye) or bilateral (both eyes), multifocal orunifocal. In order for the tumors to be considered multi-focal, they must have arisen independently and not as theresult of the spread of cancer cells. It is also important tocheck for trilateral retinoblastoma.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2885Retinoblastoma\\nThis child’s right eye is completely covered with a tumor\\nassociated with retinoblastoma.

The goal of treatment is to cure the cancer and pre-vent as much loss of vision as possible.\\nTREATMENT OF INTRAOCULAR TUMORS. Surgical\\nremoval of the affected eye (enucleation) is used whenthe tumor(s) are so large and extensive that preservationof sight is not possible. This surgery is performed undergeneral anesthetic and usually takes less than an hour.Most children who have undergone this surgery canleave the hospital on the same day. A temporary ball isplaced in the eye socket after the surgery. Approximate-ly three weeks after the operation, a plastic artificial eye(prosthesis) that looks like the normal eye is insertedinto the eye socket.\\nRadiation therapy is often used for treatment of\\nlarge tumors when preservation of sight is possible.External beam radiation therapy involves focusing a beamof radiation on the eye. If the tumor has not spread exten-sively, the radiation beam can be focused on the cancer-ous retinal cells. If the cancer is extensive, radiation treat-ment of the entire eye may be necessary. External beamradiation is performed on an outpatient basis and usuallyoccurs over a period of three to four weeks. Some chil-dren may need sedatives prior to the treatment. This typeof therapy can result in a temporary loss of a patch of hairon the back of the head and a small area of “sun-burned”skin. Long-term side effects of radiation treatment caninclude cataracts , vision problems, bleeding from the\\nretina, and decreased growth of the bones on the side ofthe head. People with an inherited form of retinoblastomahave an increased risk of developing other cancers as aresult of this therapy. Some consideration should there-fore be given to alternative treatment therapies for thosewith an inherited form of retinoblastoma.\\nPhotocoagulation therapy is often used in conjunction\\nwith radiation therapy but may be used alone to treat smalltumors that are located on the back of the eye. Photocoagu-lation involves using a laser to destroy the cancer cells. Thistype of treatment is done under local or general anesthesiaand is usually not associated with post-procedural pain.\\nThermotherapy is also often used in conjunction\\nwith radiation therapy or drug therapy ( chemotherapy ).\\nThermotherapy involves the use of heat to help shrinktumor cells. The heat is either used on the whole eye orlocalized to the tumor area. It is done under local or gen-eral anesthesia and is usually not painful.\\nCryotherapy is a treatment often used in conjunc-\\ntion with radiation therapy but can also be used alone onsmall tumors located on the front part of the retina.\\nCryotherapy involves the use of intense cold to destroycancer cells and can result in harmless, temporaryswelling of the external eye and eyelids that can last forup to five days. Eye drops or ointment are sometimesprovided to reduce the swelling.\\nBrachytherapy involves the application of radioac-\\ntive material to the outer surface of the eye at the base ofthe tumor. It is generally used for tumors of mediumsize. A patient undergoing this type of procedure is usu-ally hospitalized for three to seven days. During thattime, he or she undergoes one surgery to attach theradioactive material and one surgery to remove it. Eyedrops are often administered for three to four weeks fol-lowing the operation to prevent inflammation and infec-tion. The long-term side effects of this treatment caninclude cataracts and damage to the retina, which canlead to impaired vision.\\nIntravenous treatment with one or more drugs\\n(chemotherapy) is often used for treatment of both largeand small tumors. Chemotherapy is sometimes used toshrink tumors prior to other treatments such as radiationtherapy or brachytherapy. Occasionally, it is also usedalone to treat very small tumors.\\nTREATMENT OF INTRAOCULAR AND UNILATERAL\\nRETINOBLASTOMA. Often, by the time that unilateral\\nretinoblastoma is diagnosed, the tumor is so large thatuseful vision cannot be preserved. In these cases removalof the eye (enucleation) is the treatment of choice. Othertherapies are unnecessary if enucleation is used to treatintraocular unilateral retinoblastoma. If the tumor is smallenough, other therapies such as external beam radiationtherapy, photocoagulation, cryotherapy, thermotherapy,chemotherapy, and brachytherapy may be considered.\\nTREATMENT OF INTRAOCULAR AND BILATERAL\\nRETINOBLASTOMA. If vision can be preserved in both\\neyes, radiation therapy of both eyes may be recommended.Smaller, more localized tumors can sometimes be treatedby local therapies such as cryotherapy, photocoagulationtherapy, thermotherapy or brachytherapy. Some centersmay use chemotherapy in place of radiation therapy whenthe tumors are too large to be treated by local therapies orare found over the optic nerve of the eye. Many centers aremoving away from radiation treatment and towardchemotherapy because it is less likely to induce futuretumors. Enucleation is performed on the more severelyaffected eye if sight cannot be preserved in both.\\nEXTRAOCULAR RETINOBLASTOMA.

Those with extraocular retinoblastoma haveless than a 10% chance of disease-free survival for thesame amount of time. Trilateral retinoblastoma generallyhas a very poor prognosis. Patients with trilateralretinoblastoma who receive treatment have an average sur-vival rate of approximately eight months, while those whoremain untreated have an average survival rate of approxi-mately one month. Patients with trilateral retinoblastomawho are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis may have abetter prognosis then those who experience symptoms.\\nPatients with an inherited form of unilateral retinoblas-\\ntoma have a 70% chance of developing retinoblastoma inthe other eye. Retinoblastoma reoccurs in the other eye inapproximately 5% of people with a non-inherited form ofretinoblastoma, so it is advisable for even these patients tobe closely monitored. People with an inherited form ofretinoblastoma who have not undergone radiation treat-ment have approximately a 26% chance of developing can-cer in another part of the body within 50 years of the initialdiagnosis. Those with an inherited form who have under-gone radiation treatment have a 58% chance of developinga secondary cancer by 50 years after the initial diagnosis.Most of the secondary cancers are skin cancers, bonetumors (osteosarcomas), and soft-tissue sarcomas . Soft-\\ntissue sarcomas are malignant tumors of the muscle,nerves, joints, blood vessels, deep skin tissues, or fat.\\nPrevention\\nAlthough retinoblastoma cannot be prevented, appro-\\npriate screening and surveillance should be applied to allat-risk individuals to ensure that the tumor(s) are diag-nosed at an early stage. The earlier the diagnosis, the morelikely that an eye can be salvaged and vision maintained.\\nScreening of people diagnosed with retinoblastoma\\nChildren who have been diagnosed with retinoblas-\\ntoma should receive periodic dilated retinal examinationsuntil the age of five. Young children will need to undergothese evaluations under anesthetic. After five years of age,periodic eye examinations are recommended. It may beadvisable for patients with bilateral retinoblastoma or aninherited form of retinoblastoma to undergo periodicscreening for the brain tumors found in trilateral retinoblas-toma. There are no specific screening protocols designed to\\ndetect non-ocular tumors. All lumps and complaints ofbone pain, however, should be thoroughly evaluated.\\nScreening of relatives\\nWhen a child is diagnosed with retinoblastoma, it is\\nrecommended that parents and siblings receive a dilatedretinal examination by an ophthalmologist who is experi-enced in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. It isalso recommended that siblings continue to undergo peri-odic retinal examinations under anesthetic until they arethree years of age. From three to seven years of age, peri-odic eye examinations are recommended. The retinalexaminations can be avoided if DNA testing indicates thatthe patient has a non-inherited form of retinoblastoma or ifthe sibling has not inherited the RB1 gene change/dele-tion. Any relatives who are found through DNA testing tohave inherited an RB1 gene change/deletion should under-go the same surveillance procedures as siblings.\\nThe children of someone diagnosed with retinoblas-\\ntoma should also undergo periodic retinal examinationsunder anesthetic. Retinal surveillance should be per-formed unless DNA testing proves that their child doesnot possess the RB1 gene change/deletion. If desired,prenatal detection of tumors using ultrasound may alsobe performed. During the ultrasound procedure, a hand-held instrument is placed on the maternal abdomen orinserted vaginally. The ultrasound produces sound wavesthat are reflected back from the body structures of thefetus, producing a picture that can be seen on a videoscreen. If a tumor is detected through this evaluation, theaffected baby may be delivered a couple of weeks earlier.This can allow for earlier intervention and treatment.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBrunner, Sharon H.

There are many causes and types of retinopathy.\\nDescription\\nThe retina is the thin membrane that lines the back of\\nthe eye and contains light-sensitive cells (photoreceptors).Light enters the eye and is focused onto the retina. Thephotoreceptors send a message to the brain via the opticnerve. The brain then “interprets” the electrical messagesent to it, resulting in vision. The macula is a specific areaof the retina responsible for central vision. The fovea isabout 1.5 mm in size and located in the macula. The foveais responsible for sharp vision. When looking at some-thing, the fovea should be directed at the object.\\nRetinopathy, or damage to the retina, has various\\ncauses. A hardening or thickening of the retinal arteriesis called arteriosclerotic retinopathy. High blood pressurein the arteries of the body can damage the retinal arteriesand is called hypertensive retinopathy. The spreading of asyphilis infection to the retinal blood vessels cases\\nsyphilitic retinopathy, and diabetes damages the retinalvessels resulting in a condition called diabetic retinopa-thy. Sickle cell anemia also affects the blood vessels inthe eyes. Exposure to the sun (or looking at the sun dur-ing an eclipse) can cause damage (solar retinopathy), aswell as certain drugs (for example, chloroquine, thiori-dazine, and large doses of tamoxifen). The arteries andveins can become blocked, thus resulting in a retinalartery or vein occlusion. These are just some of the caus-es of the various retinopathies.\\nRetinopathies are divided into two broad categories,\\nsimple or nonproliferative retinopathies and proliferative\\nretinopathies. The simple retinopathies include the defectsidentified by bulging of the vessel walls, by bleeding intothe eye, by small clumps of dead retinal cells called cottonwool exudates, and by closed vessels. This form ofretinopathy is considered mild. The proliferative, orsevere, forms of retinopathies include the defects identi-fied by newly grown blood vessels, by scar tissue formedwithin the eye, by closed-off blood vessels that are badlydamaged, and by the retina breaking away from its meshof blood vessels that nourish it ( retinal detachment ).\\nWhile each disease has its own specific effect on the\\nretina, a general scenario for many of the retinopathies is\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2889Retinopathies\\nA slit lamp view of a human eye with diabetic retinopathy.\\n(Custom Medical Stock Photo.

Blood flow to the retina is disrupted,either by blockage or breakdown of the various vessels.This can lead to bleeding (hemorrhage) and fluids, cells,and proteins leaking into the area (exudates). There canbe a lack of oxygen to surrounding tissues (hypoxia) ordecreased blood flow ( ischemia ). Chemicals produced\\nby the body then can cause new blood vessels to grow(neovascularization), however, these new vessels gener-ally leak and cause more problems. Neovascularizationcan even grow on the colored part of the eye (iris). Theretina can swell and vision will be affected.\\nDiabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness\\nin people ages 20 to 74. Diabetic retinopathy will occur in90% of persons with type 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent,or insulin requiring) and 65% of persons with type II dia-betes (non-insulin-dependent, or not requiring insulin) byabout 10 years after the beginning of diabetes. In the Unit-ed States, new cases of blindness are most often caused bydiabetic retinopathy. Among these new cases of blindness,12% are people between the ages of 20 to 44 years, and19% are people between the ages of 45 to 64 years.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are many causes of retinopathy. Some of the\\nmore common ones are listed below.\\nDiabetic retinopathy\\nDiabetes is a complex disorder characterized by an\\ninability of the body to properly regulate the levels ofsugar and insulin (a hormone made by the pancreas) in theblood. As diabetes progresses, the blood vessels that feedthe retina become damaged in different ways. The dam-aged vessels can have bulges in their walls (aneurysms),they can leak blood into the surrounding jelly-like material(vitreous) that fills the inside of the eyeball, they canbecome completely closed, or new vessels can begin togrow where there would not normally be blood vessels.However, although these new blood vessels are growing inthe eye, they cannot nourish the retina and they bleed easi-ly, releasing blood into the inner region of the eyeball,which can cause dark spots and cloudy vision.\\nDiabetic retinopathy begins prior to any outward\\nsigns of disease being noticed. Once symptoms arenoticed, they include poorer than normal vision, fluctuat-ing or distorted vision, cloudy vision, dark spots, episodesof temporary blindness, or permanent blindness.\\nHypertensive retinopathy\\nHigh blood pressure can affect the vessels in the eyes.\\nSome blood vessels can narrow. The blood vessels canthicken and harden (arteriosclerosis). There will be flame-\\nshaped hemorrhages and macular swelling ( edema ). This\\nedema may cause distorted or decreased vision.\\nSickle cell retinopathy\\nSickle cell anemia occurs mostly in blacks and is a\\nhereditary disease that affects the red blood cells. Thesickle-shaped blood cell reduces blood flow. People willnot have visual symptoms early on in the disease—symptoms are more systemic. However, patients need tobe followed closely in case neovascularization occurs.\\nRetinal vein and artery occlusion\\nRetinal vein occlusion generally occurs in the\\nelderly. There is usually a history of other systemic dis-ease, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. The centralretinal vein (CRV), or the retinal veins branching off ofthe CRV , can become compressed, thus stopping thedrainage of blood from the retina. This may occur if thecentral retinal artery hardens.\\nSymptoms of retinal vein occlusion include a sud-\\nden, painless loss of vision or field of vision in one eye.There may be a sudden onset of floating spots (floaters)or flashing lights. Vision may be unchanged or decreasedramatically.\\nRetinal artery occlusion is generally the result of\\nan embolism that dislodges from somewhere else in the\\nbody and travels to the eye. Transient loss of vision mayprecede an occlusion. Symptoms of a central retinalartery or branch occlusion include a sudden, painless lossof vision or decrease in visual field. Ten percent of thecases of a retinal artery occlusion occur because of giantcell arteritis (a chronic vascular disease).\\nSolar retinopathy\\nLooking directly at the sun or watching an eclipse\\ncan cause damage. There may be a loss of the centralvisual field or decreased vision. The symptoms can occurhours to days after the incident.\\nDrug-related retinopathies\\nCertain medications can affect different areas of the\\nretina. Doses of 20–40 mg a day of tamoxifen usuallydoes not cause a problem, but much higher doses maycause irreversible damage.\\nPatients taking chloroquine for lupus, rheumatoid\\narthritis , or other disorders may notice a decrease in\\nvision. If so, discontinuing medication will stop, but notreverse, any damage. However, patients should never dis-continue medication without the advise of their physician.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2890Retinopathies'),\n",

However, patients needto be aware if any medication they are taking will affectthe eyes. Patients need to inform their doctors of anyvisual effects.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe damaged retinal blood vessels and other retinal\\nchanges are visible to an eye doctor when an examina-tion of the retina (fundus exam) is done. This can be doneusing a hand-held instrument called an ophthalmoscopeor another instrument called a binocular indirect ophthal-moscope. This allows the doctor to see the back of theeye. Certain retinopathies have classic signs (for exam-ple, vascular “sea fans” in sickle cell, dot and blot hem-orrhages in diabetes, flame-shaped hemorrhages in highblood pressure). Patients may then be referred for othertests to confirm the underlying cause of the retinopathy.These tests include blood tests and measurement ofblood pressure.\\nFluorescein angiography , where a dye is injected\\ninto the patient and the back of the eyes are viewed andphotographed, helps to locate leaky vessels. Sometimespatients may become nauseated from the dye.\\nTreatment\\nRetinal specialists are ophthalmologists who spe-\\ncialize in retinal disorders. Retinopathy is a disorder ofthe retina that can result from different underlying sys-temic causes, so general physicians should be consultedas well. For drug-related retinopathies, the treatment isgenerally discontinuation of the drug (only under thecare of a physician).\\nSurgery with lasers can help to prevent blindness or\\nlessen any losses in vision. The high-energy light from alaser is aimed at the weakened blood vessels in the eye,destroying them. Scars will remain where the laser treat-ment was performed. For that reason, laser treatmentcannot be performed everywhere. For example, laserphotocoagulation at the fovea would destroy the area forsharp vision. Panretinal photocoagulation may be per-formed. This is a larger area of treatment in the peripheryof the retina; hopefully it will decrease neovasculariza-tion. Prompt treatment of proliferative retinopathy mayreduce the risk of severe vision loss by 50%.\\nPatients with retinal artery occlusion should be\\nreferred to a cardiologist. Patients with retinal vein occlu-sion need to be referred to a physician, as they may have anunderlying systemic disorder, such as high blood pressure.Prognosis\\nNonproliferative retinopathy has a better prognosis\\nthan proliferative retinopathy. Prognosis depends uponthe extent of the retinopathy, the cause, and promptnessof treatment.\\nPrevention\\nComplete eye examinations done regularly can help\\nto detect early signs of retinopathy. Patients on certainmedications should have more frequent eye exams. Theyalso should have a baseline eye exam when starting thedrug. Persons with diabetes must take extra care to besure to have thorough, periodic eye exams, especially ifearly signs of visual impairment are noticed. Anyone\\nexperiencing a sudden loss of vision, decrease in visionor visual field, flashes of light, or floating spots shouldcontact their eye doctor right away.\\nProper medical treatment for any of the systemic\\ndiseases known to cause retinal damage will help preventretinopathy. For diabetics, maintaining proper bloodsugar and blood pressure levels is important as well;however, some form of retinopathy will usually occur indiabetics, given enough time. A proper diet, particularlyfor those persons with diabetes, and stopping smoking\\nwill also help delay retinopathy.\\nFrequent, thorough eye exams and control of sys-\\ntemic disorders are the best prevention.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nFoster, Daniel, W. “Diabetes Mellitus.” In Harrison’s Princi-\\nples of Internal Medicine , ed.

Rheumatic fever can seriously damage\\nthe valves of the heart.\\nDescription\\nThroat infection with a member of the Group A\\nstreptococcus (strep) bacteria is a common problemamong school-aged children. It is easily treated with aten-day course of antibiotics by mouth. However, when\\nsuch a throat infection occurs without symptoms, orwhen a course of medication is not taken for the full tendays, there is a 3% chance of that person developingrheumatic fever. Other types of strep infections (such asof the skin) do not put the patient at risk for RF.\\nChildren between the ages of five and fifteen are\\nmost susceptible to strep throat, and therefore most sus-ceptible to rheumatic fever. Other risk factors includepoverty, overcrowding (as in military camps), and lack ofaccess to good medical care. Just as strep throat occursmost frequently in fall, winter, and early spring, so doesrheumatic fever.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nTwo different theories exist as to how a bacterial\\nthroat infection can develop into the disease calledrheumatic fever. One theory, less supported by researchevidence, suggests that the bacteria produce some kind ofpoisonous chemical (toxin). This toxin is sent into circu-lation throughout the bloodstream, thus affecting othersystems of the body.\\nResearch seems to point to a different theory, how-\\never. This theory suggests that the disease is caused bythe body’s immune system acting inappropriately. Thebody produces immune cells (called antibodies), whichare specifically designed to recognize and destroy invad-ing agents; in this case, streptococcal bacteria. The anti-bodies are able to recognize the bacteria because the bac-teria contain special markers called antigens. Due to aresemblance between Group A streptococcus bacteria’santigens and antigens present on the body’s own cells,the antibodies mistakenly attack the body itself.\\nIt is interesting to note that members of certain fami-\\nlies seem to have a greater tendency to develop rheumat-ic fever than do others. This could be related to the abovetheory, in that these families may have cell antigenswhich more closely resemble streptococcal antigens thando members of other families.\\nIn addition to fever, in about 75% of all cases of RF\\none of the first symptoms is arthritis. The joints (espe-cially those of the ankles, knees, elbows, and wrists)become red, hot, swollen, shiny, and extraordinarilypainful. Unlike many other forms of arthritis, the arthritismay not occur symmetrically (affecting a particular jointon both the right and left sides, simultaneously). Thearthritis of RF rarely strikes the fingers, toes, or spine.The joints become so tender that even the touch of bed-sheets or clothing is terribly painful.\\nA peculiar type of involuntary movement, coupled\\nwith emotional instability, occurs in about 10% of all RFpatients (the figure used to be about 50%). The patientbegins experiencing a change in coordination, often firstnoted by changes in handwriting. The arms or legs mayflail or jerk uncontrollably. The patient seems to developa low threshold for anger and sadness. This feature of RFis called Sydenham’s chorea or St. Vitus’ Dance.\\nA number of skin changes are common to RF. A rash\\ncalled erythema marginatum develops (especially inthose patients who will develop heart problems fromtheir illness), composed of pink splotches, which mayeventually spread into each other. It does not itch. Bumpsthe size of peas may occur under the skin. These arecalled subcutaneous nodules; they are hard to the touch,but not painful. These nodules most commonly occurover the knee and elbow joint, as well as over the spine.\\nThe most serious problem occurring in RF is called\\npancarditis (“pan” means total; “carditis” refers toinflammation of the heart). Pancarditis is an inflamma-tion that affects all aspects of the heart, including the lin-ing of the heart (endocardium), the sac containing theheart (pericardium), and the heart muscle itself (myo-cardium). About 40-80% of all RF patients develop pan-carditis. This RF complication has the most serious,long-term effects. The valves within the heart (structureswhich allow the blood to flow only in the correct direc-tion, and only at the correct time in the heart’s pumpingcycle) are frequently damaged during the course of pan-carditis. This may result in blood which either leaks backin the wrong direction, or has a difficult time passing a\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2897Rheumatic fever'),\n",

Either way, damage to a valve\\ncan result in the heart having to work very hard in orderto move the blood properly. The heart may not be able to“work around” the damaged valve, which may result in aconsistently inadequate amount of blood entering the cir-culation.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of RF is done by carefully examining the\\npatient. A list of diagnostic criteria has been created.These “Jones Criteria” are divided into major and minorcriteria. A patient can be diagnosed with RF if he or shehas either two major criteria (conditions), or one majorand two minor criteria. In either case, it must also beproved that the individual has had a previous infectionwith streptococcus.\\nThe major criteria include:\\n• carditis\\n• arthritis• chorea• subcutaneous nodules\\n• erythema marginatumThe minor criteria include:\\n• fever.\\n• joint pain (without actual arthritis).\\n• evidence of electrical changes in the heart (determined\\nby measuring electrical characteristics of the heart’sfunctioning during a test called an electrocardiogram,or EKG).\\n• evidence (through a blood test) of the presence in the\\nblood of certain proteins, which are produced early inan inflammatory/infectious disease.\\nTests are also performed to provide evidence of\\nrecent infection with group A streptococcal bacteria. Aswab of the throat can be taken, and smeared on a sub-stance in a petri dish, to see if bacteria will multiply andgrow over 24-72 hours. These bacteria can then be spe-cially processed, and examined under a microscope, toidentify streptococcal bacteria. Other tests can be per-formed to see if the patient is producing specific antibod-ies; that are only made in response to a recent strep infec-tion.\\nTreatment\\nA 10-day course of penicillin by mouth, or a single\\ninjection of penicillin G, is the first line of treatment for RF.Patients will need to remain on some regular dose of peni-cillin to prevent recurrence of RF. This can mean a smalldaily dose of penicillin by mouth, or an injection everythree weeks. Some practitioners keep patients on this regi-men for five years, or until they reach 18 years of age(whichever comes first). Other practitioners prefer to con-tinue treating those patients who will be regularly exposedto streptococcal bacteria (teachers, medical workers), aswell as those patients with known RF heart disease.\\nArthritis quickly improves when the patient is given\\na preparation containing aspirin , or some other anti-\\ninflammatory agent (ibuprofen). Mild carditis will alsoimprove with such anti-inflammatory agents, althoughmore severe cases of carditis will require steroid medica-tions. A number of medications are available to treat theinvoluntary movements of chorea, including diazepamfor mild cases, and haloperidol for more severe cases.\\nPrognosis\\nThe long-term prognosis of an RF patient depends\\nprimarily on whether he or she develops carditis. This isthe only manifestation of RF which can have permanenteffects. Those patients with no or mild carditis have anexcellent prognosis. Those with more severe carditishave a risk of heart failure , as well as a risk of future\\nheart problems, which may lead to the need for valvereplacement surgery.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2898Rheumatic fever\\nA magnified image of cardiac muscle damaged by chronic\\nmyocarditis caused by rheumatic fever.

Other problems throughout the body (systemicproblems) may also develop, including inflammation ofblood vessels ( vasculitis ), the development of bumps\\n(called rheumatoid nodules) in various parts of the body,lung disease, blood disorders, and weakening of thebones ( osteoporosis ).\\nDescription\\nThe skeletal system of the body is made up of differ-\\nent types of strong, fibrous tissue called connective tis-sue. Bone, cartilage, ligaments, and tendons are all formsof connective tissue that have different compositions anddifferent characteristics.\\nThe joints are structures that hold two or more bones\\ntogether. Some joints (synovial joints) allow for move-ment between the bones being joined (articulatingbones). The simplest synovial joint involves two bones,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2899Rheumatoid arthritis'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 605}, page_content='separated by a slight gap called the joint cavity. The ends\\nof each articular bone are covered by a layer of cartilage.Both articular bones and the joint cavity are surroundedby a tough tissue called the articular capsule. The articu-lar capsule has two components, the fibrous membraneon the outside and the synovial membrane (or synovium)on the inside. The fibrous membrane may include toughbands of tissue called ligaments, which are responsiblefor providing support to the joints. The synovial mem-brane has special cells and many tiny blood vessels (cap-illaries). This membrane produces a supply of synovialfluid that fills the joint cavity, lubricates it, and helps thearticular bones move smoothly about the joint.\\nIn rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the synovial membrane\\nbecomes severely inflamed. Usually thin and delicate, thesynovium becomes thick and stiff, with numerous infold-ings on its surface. The membrane is invaded by whiteblood cells, which produce a variety of destructive chemi-cals. The cartilage along the articular surfaces of the bonesmay be attacked and destroyed, and the bone, articular cap-sule, and ligaments may begin to wear away (erode). Theseprocesses severely interfere with movement in the joint.\\nRA exists all over the world and affects men and\\nwomen of all races. In the United States alone, about twomillion people suffer from the disease. Women are threetimes more likely than men to have RA. About 80% ofpeople with RA are diagnosed between the ages of 35-50. RA appears to run in families, although certain fac-tors in the environment may also influence the develop-ment of the disease.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe underlying event that promotes RA in a person\\nis unknown. Given the known genetic factors involved inRA, some researchers have suggested that an outsideevent occurs that triggers the disease cycle in a personwith a particular genetic makeup.\\nMany researchers are examining the possibility that\\nexposure to an organism (like a bacteria or virus) may bethe first event in the development of RA. The body’s nor-mal response to such an organism is to produce cells thatcan attack and kill the organism, protecting the bodyfrom the foreign invader. In an autoimmune disease likeRA, this immune cycle spins out of control. The bodyproduces misdirected immune cells, which accidentallyidentify parts of the person’s body as foreign. Theseimmune cells then produce a variety of chemicals thatinjure and destroy parts of the body.\\nRA can begin very gradually, or it can strike quickly.\\nThe first symptoms are pain , swelling, and stiffness in\\nthe joints. The most commonly involved joints includehands, feet, wrists, elbows, and ankles, although otherjoints may also be involved. The joints are affected in a\\nsymmetrical fashion. This means that if the right wrist isinvolved, the left wrist is also involved. Patients frequent-ly experience painful joint stiffness when they first get upin the morning, lasting for perhaps an hour. Over time,the joints become deformed. The joints may be difficultto straighten, and affected fingers and toes may be per-manently bent (flexed). The hands and feet may curveoutward in an abnormal way.\\nMany patients also notice increased fatigue , loss of\\nappetite, weight loss, and sometimes fever . Rheumatoid\\nnodules are bumps that appear under the skin around thejoints and on the top of the arms and legs. These nodulescan also occur in the tissue covering the outside of thelungs and lining the chest cavity (pleura), and in the tis-sue covering the brain and spinal cord (meninges). Lunginvolvement may cause shortness of breath and is seen\\nmore in men. Vasculitis (inflammation of the blood ves-sels) may interfere with blood circulation. This can resultin irritated pits (ulcers) in the skin, tissue death (gan-\\ngrene ), and interference with nerve functioning that\\ncauses numbness and tingling .\\nJuvenile RA is a chronic inflammatory disease that\\naffects the joints of children less than 16 years old. It isestimated to affect as many as 250,000 children in theUnited States alone. Most children with juvenile RAhave arthritis when the illness starts, which affects multi-ple joints in 50% of these children, and only one joint in30%. In all, 20% of the children affected by juvenile RAhave the acute systemic form of the disease, which ischaracterized by fever, joint inflammation, rash, liverdisease, and gastrointestinal disease.\\nTwo periods of childhood are associated with an\\nincreased incidence of onset of juvenile RA. The first isfrom one to three years of age, and the second, fromeight to 12 years. When more than four joints are affect-ed, the disease is described as being polyarticular. If lessthan four joints are affected, the disease is known as pau-ciarticular juvenile RA, and this particular manifestationfalls into two categories. The first occurs in girls agedone to four years old, and the onset of joint involvementis in the knees, ankles, or elbows. The second formoccurs in boys aged eight years and older, and involvesthe larger joints, such as those of the hips and legs.\\nDiagnosis\\nThere are no tests available that can absolutely diag-\\nnose RA. Instead, a number of tests exist that can suggestthe diagnosis of RA. Blood tests include a special test ofred blood cells (called erythrocyte sedimentation\\nrate), which is positive in nearly 100% of patients with\\nRA. However, this test is also positive in a variety of\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2900Rheumatoid arthritis'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 606}, page_content='other diseases. Tests for anemia are usually positive in\\npatients with RA, but can also be positive in many otherunrelated diseases. Rheumatoid factor is another diag-nostic test that measures the presence and amounts ofrheumatoid factor in the blood. Rheumatoid factor is anautoantibody found in about 80% of patients with RA. Itis often not very specific however, because it is found inabout 5% of all healthy people and in 10-20% of healthypeople over the age of 65. In addition, rheumatoid factoris also positive in a large number of other autoimmunediseases and other infectious diseases, including sys-\\ntemic lupus erythematosus , bacterial endocarditis ,\\nmalaria , and syphilis . In addition, young people who\\nhave a process called juvenile rheumatoid arthritis oftenhave no rheumatoid factor present in their blood.\\nFinally, the clinician may examine the synovial\\nfluid, by inserting a thin needle into a synovial joint. InRA, this fluid has certain characteristics that indicateactive inflammation. The fluid is cloudy, with increasedprotein and decreased or normal glucose. It also containsa higher than normal number of white blood cells. Whilethese findings suggest inflammatory arthritis, they arenot specific to RA.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no cure available for RA. However, treat-\\nment is available to combat the inflammation in order toprevent destruction of the joints, and to prevent othercomplications of the disease. Efforts are also made tomaintain flexibility and mobility of the joints.\\nThe “first line” agents for the treatment of RA include\\nnonsteroidal anti- inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) andaspirin , which are used to decrease inflammation and to\\ntreat pain. The NSAIDs include naproxen (Naprosyn),ibuprofen (Advil, Medipren, Motrin), and etodolac(Lodine). While these medications can be helpful, they donot interrupt the progress of the disease. Low-dose steroidmedications can be helpful at both managing symptomsand slowing the progress of RA. Disease-modifyingantirheumatic drugs , including gold compounds, D-\\npenicillamine, certain antimalarial-like drugs, and sul-fasalazine (Azulfadine) are also often the first agents clini-cians use to treat RA, but in patients with the aggressivedestructive type of RA, more slow-acting medications areneeded. Methotrexate, azathioprine, and cyclophos-phamide are all drugs that suppress the immune systemand can decrease inflammation. All of the drugs listedhave significant toxic side effects, which require health-care professionals to carefully compare the risks associat-ed with these medications versus the benefits.\\nRecently, several categories of drugs have been\\nexplored and developed for the treatment of RA. The firstis a category of agents known as biological response\\nmodifiers. These work to reduce joint inflammation byblocking a substance called tumor necrosis factor (TNF).TNF is a protein that triggers inflammation during thebody’s normal immune responses. When TNF productionis not regulated, the excess TNF can cause inflammation.Three agents in this class have become “second line”drugs for the treatment of RA. These are etanercept(Enbrel), leflunamide (Arava), and infliximab (Remi-cade), and they are recommended for patients in whomother medications have not been effective. Etanercept isapproved by the FDA but is not recommended for patientswith active infection. It is given twice weekly via subcuta-neous injections by either the patient or a health care pro-fessional. Because this agent is so new, long-term sideeffects have not been fully studied. Infliximab is givenintravenously once every eight weeks, and is approved forcombined use with methotrexate to combat RA.\\nThe cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors are\\nanother category of drugs used to treat RA. Like the tra-ditional NSAIDs, the COX-2 inhibitors work to blockCOX-2, which is an enzyme that stimulates inflammato-ry responses in the body. Unlike the NSAIDs, the COX-2inhibitors do not carry a high risk of gastrointestinalulcers and bleeding, because they do not inhibit COX-1,which is the enzyme that protects the stomach lining.These new agents include celecoxib (Celebrex) and rofe-coxib (Vioxx). Celecoxib has been approved by the FDAfor the treatment of RA and osteoarthritis , and is taken\\nonce or twice daily by mouth. Rofecoxib is approved forRA and osteoarthritis, and for acute pain caused by pri-mary dysmenorrhea and surgery.\\nTotal bed rest is sometimes prescribed during the\\nvery active, painful phases of RA. Splints may be used tosupport and rest painful joints. Later, after inflammationhas somewhat subsided, physical therapists may providea careful exercise regimen in an attempt to maintain the\\nmaximum degree of flexibility and mobility. Joint\\nreplacement surgery, particularly for the knee and the\\nhip joints, is sometimes recommended when these jointshave been severely damaged.\\nAlternative treatment\\nA variety of alternative therapies has been recom-\\nmended for patients with RA. Meditation , hypnosis,\\nguided imagery , and relaxation techniques have been\\nused effectively to control pain. Acupressure and\\nacupuncture have also been used for pain. Bodywork can\\nbe soothing, decreasing stress and tension, and is thought\\nto improve/restore chemical balance within the body.\\nA multitude of nutritional supplements can be useful\\nfor RA. Fish oils, the enzymes bromelain and pancreatin,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2901Rheumatoid arthritis'),\n",

Yoga has been used for RA patients to promote relax-\\nation, relieve stress, and improve flexibility. Nutritionistssuggest that a vegetarian diet low in animal products andsugar may help to decrease both inflammation and painfrom RA. Beneficial foods for patients with RA includecold water fish (mackerel, herring, salmon, and sardines)and flavonoid-rich berries (cherries, blueberries,hawthorn berries, blackberries, etc.).\\nRA, considered an autoimmune disorder, is often\\nconnected with food allergies/intolerances. An elimina-tion/challenge diet can help to decrease symptoms of RAas well as identify the foods that should be eliminated toprevent flare-ups and recurrences. Hydrotherapy can\\nhelp to greatly reduce pain and inflammation. Moist heatis more effective than dry heat, and cold packs are usefulduring acute flare-ups.\\nPrognosis\\nAbout 15% of all RA patients will have symptoms\\nfor a short period of time and will ultimately get better,leaving them with no long-term problems. A number offactors are considered to suggest the likelihood of aworse prognosis. These include:\\n• race and gender (female and Caucasian).• more than 20 joints involved.• extremely high erythrocyte sedimentation rate.\\n• extremely high levels of rheumatoid factor.\\n• consistent, lasting inflammation.• evidence of erosion of bone, joint, or cartilage on x\\nrays.\\n• poverty.• older age at diagnosis.\\n• rheumatoid nodules.\\n• other coexisting diseases.KEY TERMS\\nArticular bones —Two or more bones connected\\nto each other via a joint.\\nJoint —Structures holding two or more bones\\ntogether.\\nPauciarticular juvenile RA —Rheumatoid arthritis\\nfound in children that affects less than four joints.\\nPolyarticular juvenile RA —Rheumatoid arthritis\\nfound in children that affects more than fourjoints.\\nSynovial joint —A type of joint that allows articu-\\nlar bones to move.\\nSynovial membrane —The membrane that lines\\nthe inside of the articular capsule of a joint andproduces a lubricating fluid called synovial fluid.\\n• certain genetic characteristics, diagnosable through\\ntesting.\\nPatients with RA have a shorter life span, averaging\\na decrease of three to seven years of life.

In rhinitis, the mucousmembranes become infected or irritated, producing a dis-charge, congestion, and swelling of the tissues. The mostwidespread form of infectious rhinitis, is the common\\ncold .\\nThe common cold is the most frequent viral infec-\\ntion in the general population, causing more absenteeismfrom school or work than any other illness. Colds areself-limited, lasting about 3-10 days, although they aresometimes followed by a bacterial infection. Children aremore susceptible than adults; teenage boys more suscep-tible than teenage girls; and adult women more suscepti-ble than adult men. In the United States, colds are mostfrequent during the late fall and winter.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nColds can be caused by as many as 200 different\\nviruses. The viruses are transmitted by sneezing andcoughing, by contact with soiled tissues or handker-chiefs, or by close contact with an infected person. Coldsare easily spread in schools, offices, or any place wherepeople live or work in groups. The incubation periodranges between 24 and 72 hours.\\nThe onset of a cold is usually sudden. The virus caus-\\nes the lining of the nose to become inflamed and producelarge quantities of thin, watery mucus. Children some-times run a fever with a cold. The inflammation spreads\\nfrom the nasal passages to the throat and upper airway,producing a dry cough ,headache , and watery eyes.\\nSome people develop muscle or joint aches and feel gen-erally tired or weak. After several days, the nose becomesless inflamed and the watery discharge is replaced by athick, sticky mucus. This change in the appearance of thenasal discharge helps to distinguish rhinitis caused by aviral infection from rhinitis caused by an allergy.\\nDiagnosis\\nThere is no specific test for viral rhinitis. The diagno-\\nsis is based on the symptoms. In children, the doctor willexamine the child’s throat and glands to rule out measles\\nand other childhood illnesses that have similar early symp-toms. Adults whose symptoms last longer than a weekmay require further testing to rule out a secondary bacteri-al infection, or an allergy. Bacterial infections can usuallybe identified from a laboratory culture of the patient’snasal discharge. Allergies can be evaluated by blood tests,skin testing for specific substances, or nasal smears.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no cure for the common cold; treatment is\\ngiven for symptom relief. Medications include aspirin or\\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for\\nheadache and muscle pain , and decongestants to relieve\\nstuffiness or runny nose. Patients should be warnedagainst overusing decongestants, because they can causea rebound effect. Antibiotics are not given for colds\\nbecause they do not kill viruses.\\nSupportive care includes bed rest and drinking plen-\\nty of fluid.\\nTreatments under investigation include the use of\\nultraviolet light and injections of interferon.\\nAlternative treatment\\nHomeopaths might prescribe any of ten different\\nremedies, depending on the appearance of the nasal dis-charge, the patient’s emotional state, and the stage ofinfection. Naturopaths would recommend vitamin A andzinc supplements, together with botanical preparationsmade from echinacea (Echinacea spp.), goldenseal\\n(Hydrastis canadensis ), licorice ( Glycyrrhiza glabra ), or\\nastragalus ( Astragalus membraneceus ) root.\\nPrognosis\\nMost colds resolve completely in about a week.\\nComplications are unusual but may include sinusitis\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2903Rhinitis'),\n",

Frey\\nRhinoplasty\\nDefinition\\nThe term rhinoplasty means “nose molding” or\\n“nose forming.” It refers to a procedure in plastic surgeryin which the structure of the nose is changed. The changecan be made by adding or removing bone or cartilage,grafting tissue from another part of the body, or implanti-ng synthetic material to alter the shape of the nose.KEY TERMS\\nInterferon —A protein produced by cells infected\\nby a virus that stimulates the body’s resistance tothe virus.Purpose\\nRhinoplasty is most often performed for cosmetic\\nreasons. A nose that is too large, crooked, misshapen,malformed at birth, or deformed by an injury can begiven a more pleasing appearance. If breathing isimpaired due to the form of the nose or to an injury, itcan often be improved with rhinoplasty.\\nPrecautions\\nThe best candidates for rhinoplasty are those with\\nrelatively minor deformities. Nasal anatomy and propor-tions are quite varied and the final look of any rhinoplas-ty operation is the result of the patient’s anatomy, as wellas of the surgeon’s skill.\\nThe quality of the skin plays a major role in the out-\\ncome of rhinoplasty. Patients with extremely thick skinmay not see a definite change in the underlying bonestructure after surgery. On the other hand, thin skin pro-vides almost no cushion to hide the most minor of boneirregularities or imperfections.\\nA cosmetic change of the nose will change a per-\\nson’s appearance, but it will not change self-image. Aperson who expects a different lifestyle after rhinoplastyis likely to be disappointed.\\nRhinoplasty should not be performed until the\\npubertal growth spurt is complete, between ages 14-15for girls and older for boys.\\nThe cost of rhinoplasty depends on the difficulty of\\nthe work required and on the specialist chosen. Pricesrun from about $3,000 to over $6,000. If the problem wascaused by an injury, insurance will usually cover thecost. A rhinoplasty done only to change a person’sappearance is not usually covered by insurance.\\nDescription\\nThe external nose is composed of a series of interre-\\nlated parts which include the skin, the bony pyramid, car-tilage, and the tip of the nose, which is both cartilage andskin. The strip of skin separating the nostrils is called thecolumella.\\nSurgical approaches to nasal reconstruction are var-\\nied. Internal rhinoplasty involves making all incisionsinside the nasal cavity. The external or “open” techniqueinvolves a skin incision across the base of the nasal col-umella. An external incision allows the surgeon toexpose the bone and cartilage more fully and is mostoften used for complicated procedures. During surgery,the surgeon will separate the skin from the bone and car-tilage support. The framework of the nose is thenreshaped in the desired form. Shape can be altered by\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2904Rhinoplasty'),\n",

A general anesthetic is used for lengthy orcomplex procedures or if the doctor and patient agreethat it is the best option.\\nSimple rhinoplasty is usually performed in an outpa-\\ntient surgery center or in the surgeon’s office. Most pro-cedures take only an hour or two, and patients go homeright away. Complex procedures may be done in the hos-pital and require a short stay.\\nPreparation\\nDuring the initial consultation, the patient and sur-\\ngeon will determine what changes can be made in theshape of the nose. Most doctors take photographs at thesame time. The surgeon will also explain the techniquesand anesthesia options available to the patient.\\nThe patient and surgeon should also discuss guide-\\nlines for eating, drinking, smoking , taking or avoiding\\ncertain medications, and washing of the face.\\nAftercare\\nPatients usually feel fine immediately after surgery,\\nhowever, most surgery centers do not allow patients todrive themselves home after an operation.\\nThe first day after surgery there will be some\\nswelling of the face. Patients should stay in bed withtheir heads elevated for at least a day. The nose may hurtand a headache is not uncommon. The surgeon will\\nprescribe medication to relieve these conditions.Swelling and bruising around the eyes will increase for afew days, but will begin to diminish after about the thirdday. Slight bleeding and stuffiness are normal, and varyaccording to the extensiveness of the surgery performed.Most people are up in two days, and back to school orwork in a week.

The recommended daily allowance (RDA) forriboflavin is 1.7 mg/day for an adult man and 1.3 mg/dayfor an adult woman. The best sources of this vitamin aremeat, dairy products, and dark green vegetables, espe-cially broccoli. Grains and legumes (beans and peas) alsocontribute riboflavin to the diet. Riboflavin is requiredfor the processing of dietary fats, carbohydrates, and pro-teins to convert these nutrients to energy. Riboflavin isalso used for the continual process of renewal and regen-eration of all cells and tissues in the body.\\nRiboflavin is sensitive to light. For this reason, com-\\nmercially available milk is sometimes supplied in car-tons, rather than in clear bottles. Riboflavin is not rapidlydestroyed by cooking. Milk contains about 1.7 mgriboflavin/kg. Cheese contains about 4.3 mg/kg, whilebeef has 2.4 mg/kg and broccoli has about 2.0 mg/kg.Apples, a food that is low in all nutrients, except water,contains only 0.1 mg riboflavin per kg.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA deficiency only in riboflavin has never occurred in\\nthe natural environment. In contrast, diseases where peo-ple are deficient in one vitamin, such as thiamin, vitaminC, and vitamin D, for example, have been clearly docu-mented. Poorer populations in the United States may bedeficient in riboflavin, but when this happens, they arealso deficient in a number of other nutrients as well.When riboflavin deficiency is actually detected, it isoften associated with low consumption of milk, chronicalcoholism , or chronic diarrhea .\\nThe symptoms of riboflavin deficiency include:\\n• swelling and fissuring of the lips (cheilosis)\\n• ulceration and cracking of the angles of the mouth\\n(angular stomatitisis)\\n• oily, scaly skin rashes on the scrotum, vulva, or area\\nbetween the nose and lips\\n• inflammation of the tongue\\n• red, itchy eyes that are sensitive to light.KEY TERMS\\nRecommended daily allowance —The recommend-\\ned daily allowances (RDAs) are quantities of nutri-ents of the diet that are required to maintain humanhealth. RDAs are established by the Food and Nutri-tion Board of the National Academy of Sciences andmay be revised every few years. A separate RDAvalue exists for each nutrient. The RDA values referto the amount of nutrient needed to maintain healthin a population of people. The actual amounts ofeach nutrient required to maintain health in any spe-cific individual differs from person to person.\\nWater-soluble vitamin —Water-soluble vitamins\\ncan be dissolved in water or juice. Fat-soluble vit-amins can be dissolved in oil or in melted fat.\\nThe nervous symptoms of riboflavin deficiency\\ninclude:\\n• numbness of the hands• decreased sensitivity to touch, temperature, and vibra-\\ntion\\nDiagnosis\\nRiboflavin status is diagnosed using a test conducted\\non red blood cells that measures the activity of anenzyme called glutathione reductase. An extract of thered blood cells is placed in two test tubes. One test tubecontains no added riboflavin, while the second test tubecontains a derivative of riboflavin, called flavin adeninedinucleotide. The added riboflavin derivative results inlittle or no stimulation of enzyme activity in patients withnormal riboflavin levels. A stimulation of 20% or less isconsidered normal. A stimulation of over 20% meansthat the patient is deficient in riboflavin.\\nTreatment\\nRiboflavin deficiency can be treated with supple-\\nmental riboflavin (0.5 mg/kg body weight per day) untilthe symptoms disappear.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for correcting riboflavin deficiency is\\nexcellent.\\nPrevention\\nRiboflavin deficiency can be prevented by including\\nmilk, cheese, yogurt, meat, and/or certain vegetables in\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2906Riboflavin deficiency'),\n",

Rick-ettsialpox causes rash, fever , chills, heavy sweating,\\nheadache , eye pain (especially when exposed to light),\\nweakness, and achy muscles.\\nDescription\\nLike other members of the family of Rickettsia, the\\nbacteria causing rickettsialpox live in mice. Tiny mitesfeed on these infected mice, thus acquiring the organism.When these mites feed on humans, the bacteria can betransmitted.\\nRickettsialpox occurs mostly within cities. In the\\nUnited States, the disease has cropped up in such placesas New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, andCleveland. It has also been identified in Russia, Korea,and Africa.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe specific bacteria responsible for rickettsialpox is\\ncalled Rickettsia akari . A person contracts this bacteria\\nthrough the bite of an infected mite. After a person hasbeen bitten by an infected mite, there is a delay of about10 days to three weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.The first symptom is a bump which appears at the\\nsite of the original bite. The bump (papule) develops atiny, fluid-filled head (vesicle). The vesicle sloughsaway, leaving a crusty black scab in its place (eschar). Inabout a week, the patient develops a fever, chills, heavysweating, headache, eye pain (especially when exposedto light), weakness, and achy muscles. The fever risesand falls over the course of about a weak. A bumpy rashspreads across the body. Each individual papule followsthe same progression: papule, then vesicle, then eschar.The rash does not affect the palms of the hands or thesoles of the feet.\\nDiagnosis\\nMost practitioners are able to diagnose rick-\\nettsialpox simply on the basis of its rising and fallingfever, and its characteristic rash. Occasionally, blood willbe drawn and tests performed to demonstrate the pres-ence of antibodies (immune cells directed against specif-ic bacterial agents) which would confirm a diagnosis ofrickettsialpox.\\nTreatment\\nBecause rickettsialpox is such a mild illness, some\\npractitioners choose to simply treat the symptoms (giv-ing acetaminophen for fever and achiness, pushing flu-\\nids to avoid dehydration ). Others will give their patients\\na course of the antibiotic tetracycline, which will shortenthe course of the illness to about one to two days.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis for full recovery from rickettsialpox is\\nexcellent. No deaths have ever been reported from thisillness, and even the skin rash heals without scarring.\\nPrevention\\nAs with all mite- or tick-borne illnesses, prevention\\nincludes avoidance of areas known to harbor the insects,and/or careful application of insect repellents. Further-more, because mice pass the bacteria on to the mites, it isimportant to keep mice from nesting in or around resi-dences.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCorey, Lawrence. “Rickettsia and Coxiella.” In Sherris Med-\\nical Microbiology: An Introduction to Infectious Diseases.3rd ed.

Ringworm may also bereferred to as dermatophyte infection.\\nAs lesions grow, the centers start to heal. The\\ninflamed borders expand and spread the infection.\\nTypes of ringworm\\nRingworm is a term that is commonly used to\\nencompass several types of fungal infection. Sometimes,however, only body ringworm is classified as true ring-worm.\\nBody ringworm (tinea corporis) can affect any part\\nof the body except the scalp, feet, and facial area where aman’s beard grows. The well-defined, flaky sores can bedry and scaly or moist and crusty.KEY TERMS\\nEschar —A crusty, blackish scab.\\nPapule —A bump on the skin.\\nVesicle —A fluid-filled head on a papule.Scalp ringworm (tinea capitis) is most common in\\nchildren. It causes scaly, swollen blisters or a rash thatlooks like black dots. Sometimes inflamed and filled withpus, scalp ringworm lesions can cause crusting, flaking,and round bald patches. Most common in black children,scalp ringworm can cause scarring and permanent hair loss.\\nRingworm of the groin (tinea cruris or jock itch)\\nproduces raised red sores with well-marked edges. It canspread to the buttocks, inner thighs, and external genitals.\\nRingworm of the nails (tinea unguium) generally\\nstarts at the tip of one or more toenails, which graduallythicken and discolor. The nail may deteriorate or pull awayfrom the nail bed. Fingernail infection is far less common.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nRingworm can be transmitted by infected people or\\npets or by towels, hairbrushes, or other objects contami-nated by them. Symptoms include inflammation, scaling,and sometimes, itching .\\nDiabetes mellitus increases susceptibility to ring-\\nworm. So do dampness, humidity, and dirty, crowded liv-ing areas. Braiding hair tightly and using hair gel alsoraise the risk.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is based on microscopic examination of\\nscrapings taken from lesions. A dermatologist may alsostudy the scalp of a patient with suspected tinea capitisunder ultraviolet light.\\nTreatment\\nSome infections disappear without treatment. Others\\nrespond to such topical antifungal medications asnaftifine (Caldesene Medicated Powder) or tinactin(Desenex) or to griseofulvin (Fulvicin), which is takenby mouth. Medications should be continued for twoweeks after lesions disappear.\\nA person with body ringworm should wear loose\\nclothing and check daily for raw, open sores. Wet dress-ings applied to moist sores two or three times a day canlessen inflammation and loosen scales. The doctor maysuggest placing special pads between folds of infectedskin, and anything the patient has touched or wornshould be sterilized in boiling water.\\nInfected nails should be cut short and straight and\\ncarefully cleared of dead cells with an emery board.\\nPatients with jock itch should:\\n• wear cotton underwear and change it more than once a\\nday\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2908Ringworm'),\n",

The illness beginswithin about two weeks of such a bite. RMSF is the mostwidespread tick-borne illness in the United States, occur-ring in every state except Alaska and Hawaii. The statesin the mid-Atlantic region, the Carolinas, and the Vir-ginias have a great deal of tick activity during the springand summer months, and the largest number of RMSFcases come from those states. About 5% of all ticks carrythe causative bacteria. Children under the age of 15 yearshave the majority of RMSF infections.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe bacterial culprit in RMSF is called Rickettsia\\nrickettsii . It causes no illness in the tick carrying it, and\\ncan be passed on to the tick’s offspring. When a tickattaches to a human, the bacteria is passed. The tick mustbe attached to the human for about six hours for this pas-sage to occur. Although prompt tick removal will cutdown on the chance of contracting RMSF, removalrequires great care. If the tick’s head and body aresquashed during the course of removal, the bacteria canbe inadvertently rubbed into the tiny bite wound.\\nSymptoms of RMSF begin within two weeks of the\\nbite of the infected tick. Symptoms usually begin sud-denly, with high fever, chills, headache , severe weak-\\nness, and muscle pain . Pain in the large muscle of the\\ncalf is very common, and may be particularly severe.The patient may be somewhat confused and delirious.Without treatment, these symptoms may last two weeksor more.\\nThe rash of RMSF is quite characteristic. It usually\\nbegins on the fourth day of the illness, and occurs in atleast 90% of all patients with RMSF. It starts around thewrists and ankles, as flat pink marks (called macules).The rash spreads up the arms and legs, toward the chest,abdomen, and back. Unlike rashes which accompany\\nvarious viral infections, the rash of RMSF does spread tothe palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Over acouple of days, the macules turn a reddish-purple color.They are now called petechiae, which are tiny areas ofbleeding under the skin (pinpoint hemorrhages). Thissignifies a new phase of the illness. Over the next severaldays, the individual petechiae may spread into eachother, resulting in larger patches of hemorrhage.\\nThe most severe effects of RMSF occur due to dam-\\nage to the blood vessels, which become leaky. Thisaccounts for the production of petechiae. As blood andfluid leak out of the injured blood vessels, other tissuesand organs may swell and become damaged, and:\\n• breathing difficulties may arise as the lungs are affected\\n• heart rhythms may become abnormal\\n• kidney failure occurs in very ill patients\\n• liver function drops\\n• the patient may experience nausea, vomiting, abdomi-\\nnal pain, and diarrhea\\n• The brain may swell ( encephalitis ) in about 25% of all\\nRMSF patients (brain injury can result in seizures,changes in consciousness, actual coma , loss of coordi-\\nnation, imbalance on walking, muscle spasms, loss ofbladder control, and various degrees of paralysis).\\n• the clotting system becomes impaired, and blood may\\nbe evident in the stools or vomit\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2910Rocky Mountain spotted fever'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 616}, page_content='Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis of RMSF is almost always made on the\\nbasis of the characteristic symptoms, coupled with eithera known tick bite (noted by about 60-70% of patients) orexposure to an area known to harbor ticks. Complex testsexist to nail down a diagnosis of RMSF, but these areperformed in only a few laboratories. Because the resultsof these tests take so long to obtain, they are seldomused. This is because delaying treatment is the maincause of death in patients with RMSF.\\nTreatment\\nIt is essential to begin treatment absolutely as soon\\nas RMSF is seriously suspected. Delaying treatment canresult in death.\\nAntibiotics are used to treat RMSF. The first choice\\nis a form of tetracycline; the second choice (used inyoung children and pregnant women) is chlorampheni-col. If the patient is well enough, treatment by oral intakeof medicine is perfectly effective. Sicker patients willneed to be given the medication through a needle in thevein (intravenously). Penicillin and sulfa drugs are notsuitable for treatment of RMSF, and their use mayincrease the death rate by delaying the use of truly effec-tive medications.\\nVery ill patients will need to be hospitalized in an\\nintensive care unit. Depending on the types of complica-tions a particular patient experiences, a variety of treat-ments may be necessary, including intravenous fluids,blood transfusions, anti-seizure medications, kidney dial-\\nysis, and mechanical ventilation (a breathing machine).\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlthough alternative treatments should never be\\nused in place of conventional treatment with antibiotics,they can be useful adjuncts to antibiotic therapy. The useof Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. bifidus supplemen-\\ntaion during and after antibiotic treatment can help rebal-ance the intestinal flora. Acupuncture ,homeopathy ,\\nand botanical medicine can all be beneficial supportivetherapies during recovery from this disease.\\nPrognosis\\nPrior to the regular use of antibiotics to treat RMSF,\\nthe death rate was about 25%. Although the death ratefrom RMSF has improved greatly with an understandingof the importance of early use of antibiotics, there is stilla 5% death rate. This rate is believed to be due to delaysin the administration of appropriate medications.\\nCertain risk factors suggest a worse outcome in\\nRMSF.

It is considered a bad prognostic sign to\\ndevelop symptoms of RMSF within only two to five daysof a tick bite.\\nPrevention\\nThe mainstay of prevention involves avoiding areas\\nknown to harbor ticks. However, because many peopleenjoy recreational activities in just such areas, the fol-lowing steps can be taken:\\n• Wear light colored clothing (so that attached ticks are\\nmore easily noticed).\\n• Wear long sleeved shirts and long pants; tuck the pants\\nlegs into socks.\\n• Spray clothing with appropriate tick repellents.\\n• Examine. Anybody who has been outside for any amount\\nof time in an area known to have a population of ticksshould examine his or her body carefully for ticks. Par-ents should examine their children at the end of the day.\\n• Remove any ticks using tweezers, so that infection\\ndoesn’t occur due to handling the tick. Grasp the tick’shead with the tweezers, and pull gently but firmly sothat the head and body are entirely removed.\\n• Keep areas around homes clear of brush, which may\\nserve to harbor ticks.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCorey, Lawrence. “Rickettsia and Coxiella.” In Sherris Med-\\nical Microbiology: An Introduction to Infectious Diseases.3rd ed.

Rolfing improvesposture, relieves chronic pain , and reduces stress .\\nPurpose\\nRolfing helps to improve posture and bring the\\nbody’s natural structure into proper balance and align-ment. This can bring relief from general aches and pains,improve breathing, increase energy, improve self-confi-dence, and relieve physical and mental stress. Rolfinghas also been used to treat such specific physical prob-lems as chronic back, neck, shoulder, and joint pain, andrepetitive stress injuries, including carpal tunnel syn-\\ndrome . Many amateur and professional athletes, includ-\\ning Olympic skaters and skiers, use Rolfing to keep intop condition, to prevent injuries, and to more quicklyrecover from injuries.\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nIda Pauline Rolf (1896–1979) was a biochemist\\nfrom New York who developed structural integrationover the course of many years after an accident as ayoung woman. She was kicked by a horse’s hoof on atrip out West and developed symptoms resembling thoseof acute pneumonia . She made her way to a hospital in\\nMontana, where she was treated by a physician whocalled in an osteopath to assist in her treatment. After theosteopath treated her, she was able to breathe normally.After her return to New York, her mother took her to ablind osteopath for further treatment. He taught her aboutthe body’s structure and function, after which Rolfbecame dissatisfied with conventional medical treatment.Following completion of a doctorate in biochemistryfrom Columbia University in 1920, Rolf studied atomicphysics, mathematics, and homeopathic medicine inEurope. After 1928, when her father died and left her aninheritance that allowed her to pursue her own studies,she explored various forms of alternative treatment,including osteopathy ,chiropractic medicine, tantric\\nyoga , the Alexander technique of tension reduction\\nthrough body movement, and Alfred Korzybski’s philos-ophy of altered states of consciousness.\\nBy 1940, Rolf had synthesized what she had learned\\nfrom these various disciplines into her own technique ofbody movement that she called structural integration,which later became known as Rolfing. During the Sec-ond World War, Rolf continued to study with anosteopath in California named Amy Cochran. In the mid-1960s, Gestalt therapist Fritz Perls invited Rolf toEsalen, where she began to develop a following amongpeople involved in the human potential movement. In1977, she published Rolfing: The Integration of Human\\nStructures , the definitive book on structural integration\\nbodywork. She continued to refine the therapy until herdeath in 1979. Rolf’s work is carried on through her\\nGuild for Structural Integration, now known as the RolfInstitute of Structural Integration, which she founded in1971 in Boulder, Colo.\\nRolfing is more than just a massage of the body’s\\nsurface. It is a system that reshapes the body’s myofas-cial structure by applying pressure and energy, therebyfreeing the body from the effects of physical and emo-tional traumas. Although Rolfing is used extensively totreat sports injuries and back pain, it is not designed as a\\ntherapy for any particular condition. Rather, it is a sys-tematic approach to overall wellness. It works by coun-teracting the effects of gravity, which over time pulls thebody out of alignment.

Thesessions are spaced a week or longer apart. After a periodof integration, specialized or advanced treatment ses-sions are available. A “tuneup” session is recommendedevery six months. In each session, the Rolfer uses his orher fingers, hands, knuckles, and elbows to rework theconnective tissue over the entire body. The tissues areworked until they become pliable, allowing the musclesto lengthen and return to their normal alignment. Thedeep tissue manipulation improves posture and agility,and increases the body’s range of movement. Rolfersalso believe that the blocked energy accumulated in thetissue from emotional tension is released through Rolfingtreatment, causing the patient to feel more energetic andhave a more positive frame of mind.\\nClients are asked to wait for a period of six to 12\\nmonths before scheduling advanced work, known as thePostTen/Advanced Series.

Wells\\nRoot canal treatment\\nDefinition\\nRoot canal treatment, also known as endodontic treat-\\nment, is a dental procedure in which the diseased or dam-aged pulp (core) of a tooth is removed and the inside areas(the pulp chamber and root canals) are filled and sealed.\\nPurpose\\nInflamed or infected pulp (pulpitis) most often causes\\na toothache . To relieve the pain and prevent further com-\\nplications, the tooth may be extracted (surgically removed)or saved by root canal treatment. Root canal treatment hasbecome a common dental procedure; more than 14 millionare performed every year, with a 95% success rate, accord-ing to the American Association of Endodontists.\\nPrecautions\\nOnce root canal treatment is performed, the patient\\nmust have a crown placed over the tooth to protect it. Thecost of the treatment and the crown may be expensive.However, replacing an extracted tooth with a fixedbridge, a removable partial denture, or an implant tomaintain the space and restore the chewing function istypically even more expensive.\\nDescription\\nRoot canal treatment may be performed by a general\\ndentist or by an endodontist, a dentist who specializes inendodontic (literally “inside of the tooth”) procedures.Inside the tooth, the pulp’s soft tissue contains the bloodsupply, by which the tooth gets its nutrients, and thenerve, by which the tooth senses hot and cold. This tissueis vulnerable to damage from deep dental decay, acciden-tal injury, tooth fracture, or trauma from repeated dentalprocedures (such as multiple fillings over time). If atooth becomes diseased or injured, bacteria build upinside the pulp, spreading infection from the naturalcrown of the tooth to the root tips in the jawbone.

Such an infection may produce pain that is severe,constant, or throbbing, as well as prolonged sensitivity toheat or cold, swelling and tenderness in the surroundinggums, facial swelling, and discoloration of the tooth.However, in some cases, the pulp may die so graduallythat there is little noticeable pain.\\nRoot canal treatment is performed under local anes-\\nthesia. A thin sheet of rubber, called a rubber dam, isplaced in the mouth to isolate the tooth. The dentistremoves any tooth decay and makes an opening through\\nthe natural crown of the tooth into the pulp chamber.Creating this access also relieves the pressure inside thetooth and can dramatically ease pain.\\nThe dentist determines the length of the root canals,\\nusually with a series of x rays. Small wire-like files arethen used to clean the entire canal space of diseased pulptissue and bacteria. The debris is flushed out with largeamounts of water (irrigation). The canals are also slightlyenlarged and shaped to receive an inert (non-reactive)filling material called gutta percha. However, the tooth isnot filled and permanently sealed until it is completelyfree of active infection. The dentist may place a tempo-rary seal, or leave the tooth open to drain, and prescribean antibiotic to counter any spread of infection from the\\ntooth. This is why root canal treatment may require sev-eral visits to the dentist.\\nOnce the canals are completely clean, they are filled\\nwith gutta percha and a sealer cement to prevent bacteriafrom entering the tooth in the future. A metal post may beplaced in the pulp chamber for added structural support andbetter retention of the crown restoration. The tooth is pro-tected by a temporary filling or crown until a permanentrestoration may be made. This restoration is usually a goldor porcelain crown, although it may be a gold inlay, or anamalgam or composite filling (paste fillings that harden).\\nPreparation\\nThere is no typical preparation for root canal treat-\\nment. Once the tooth is opened to drain, the dentist mayprescribe an antibiotic, then the patient should take thefull prescribed course. With the infection under control,local anesthetic is more effective, so that the root canalprocedure may be performed without discomfort.\\nAftercare\\nThe tooth may be sore for several days after filling.\\nPain relievers, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) may be\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2915Root canal treatment\\nEnamelInfection\\nPulp cavity\\nFigure A Figure B Figure CRubber \\ndamTemporary \\nfillingAntibiotic \\npasteDrill\\nRoot canal treatment is a dental procedure in which the diseased pulp of a tooth is removed and the inside areas are filled\\nand sealed.

A follow-up appointment should be scheduledwith the dentist for six months after treatment to make surethe tooth and surrounding structures are healthy.\\nRisks\\nThere is a possibility that the root canal treatment\\nwill not be successful the first time.

The dentist will try to identify\\nand correct problems with the first root canal treatmentbefore filling and sealing the tooth a second time.\\nIn cases where an x ray indicates that retreatment can-\\nnot correct the problem, endodontic surgery may be per-formed. In a procedure called an apicoectomy, or root resec-tioning, the root end of the tooth is accessed in the bone, anda small amount is shaved away. The area is cleaned of dis-eased tissue and a filling is placed to reseal the canal.\\nIn some cases, despite root canal treatment and\\nendodontic surgery, the tooth dies anyway and must beextracted.\\nNormal results\\nWith successful root canal treatment, the tooth will\\nno longer cause pain. However, because it does not con-tain an internal nerve, it no longer has sensitivity to hot,cold, or sweets. These are signs of dental decay, so thepatient must receive regular dental check-ups with period-ic x rays to avoid further disease in the tooth.

In later stages of the disease, the facemay swell and the nose may take on a bulb-like appear-ance called rhinophyma.\\nDescription\\nRosacea produces redness and flushing of the skin,\\nas well as pustules and papules. Areas of the face, includ-ing the nose, cheeks, forehead, and chin, are the primarysites, but some people experience symptoms on theirnecks, backs, scalp, arms, and legs.\\nThe similarity in appearance of rosacea to acne led\\npeople in the past to erroneously call the disease acnerosacea or adult acne. Like acne, the skin can have pim-ples and papules. Unlike acne, however, people withrosacea do not have blackheads.\\nIn early stages of rosacea, people typically experi-\\nence repeated episodes of flushing. Later, areas of theface are persistently red, telangiectasia appear on thenose and cheeks, as well as inflamed papules and pus-tules. Over time, the skin may take on a roughened,orange peel texture. Very late in the disorder, a smallgroup of patients with rosacea will develop rhinophyma,which can give the nose a bulb-like look.\\nUp to one half of patients with rosacea may experi-\\nence symptoms related to their eyes. Ocular rosacea, as itis called, frequently precedes the other manifestations onthe skin. Most of these eye symptoms do not threatensight, however. Telangiectasia may appear around theborders of the eyelid, the eyelids may be chronicallyinflamed, and small lumps called chalazions may devel-op. The cornea of the eye, the transparent covering overthe lens, can also be affected, and in some cases visionwill be affected.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere is no known specific cause of rosacea. A histo-\\nry of redness and flushing precedes the disease in mostpatients. The consensus among many experts is that multi-ple factors may lead to an overreaction of the facial bloodvessels, which triggers flushing. Over time, persistentepisodes of redness and flushing leave the face continuallyinflamed. Pimples and blood-vessel changes follow.\\nCertain genetic factors may also come into play,\\nalthough these have not been fully described. The diseaseis more common in women and light-skinned, fair-hairedpeople. It may be more common in people of Celticbackground, although this is an area of disagreementamong experts.Certain antibiotics are useful in the treatment of\\nrosacea, leading some researchers to suspect a bacteriumor other infectious agent may be the cause. One of thenewest suspects is a bacterium called Helicobacter\\npylori , which has been implicated in causing many cases\\nof stomach ulcers but the evidence here is mixed.\\nOther investigators have observed that a particular\\nparasite, the mite Demodex folliculorum , can be found in\\nareas of the skin affected by rosacea. The mite can alsobe detected, however, in the skin of people who do nothave the disease. It is likely that the mite does not causerosacea, but merely aggravates it.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of rosacea is made by the presence of\\nclinical symptoms. There is no specific test for the dis-ease. Episodes of persistent flushing, redness (erythema)of the nose, cheeks, chin, and forehead, accompanied bypustules and papules are hallmarks of the disease. A der-matologist will attempt to rule out a number of other dis-eases that have similar symptoms. Acne vulgaris is per-haps the disorder most commonly mistaken for rosacea,but redness and spider-like veins are not observed inpatients with acne. Blackheads and cysts, however, areseen in acne patients, but not in those with rosacea.\\nOther diseases that produce some of the same symp-\\ntoms as rosacea include perioral dermatitis and sys-\\ntemic lupus erythematosus .\\nTreatment\\nThe mainstay of treatment for rosacea is oral antibi-\\notics. These appear to work by reducing inflammation inthe small blood vessels and structure of the skin, not bydestroying bacteria that are present. Among the morewidely used oral antibiotics is tetracycline. In manypatients, antibiotics are effective against the papules andpustules that can appear on the face, but they appear lesseffective against the background redness, and they haveno effect on telangiectasia. Patients frequently take a rela-tively high dose of antibiotics until their symptoms arecontrolled, and then they slowly reduce their daily dose toa level that just keeps their symptoms in check. Other oralantibiotics used include erythromycin and minocycline.\\nSome patients are concerned about long-term use of\\noral antibiotics. For them, a topical agent applied directlyto the face may be tried in addition to an oral antibiotic,or in its place. Topical antibiotics are also useful for con-trolling the papules and pustules of rosacea, but do notcontrol the redness, flushing, and telangiectasias. Thenewest of these topical agents is metronidazole gel,which can be applied twice daily. Like the oral antibi-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2917Rosacea'),\n",

An oral retinoid, calledisotretinoin, which is used in severe cases of acne alsoreduces the pustules and papules in severe cases ofrosacea that do not respond to antibiotics. Isotretinoinmust be taken with care, however, particularly in womenof childbearing age. They must agree to a reliable formof contraception , because the drug is known to cause\\nbirth defects .\\nTopical vitamin A derivatives that are used in the\\ntreatment of acne also may have a role in the treatment ofrosacea. Accumulating evidence suggests that topicalisotretinoin and topical azelaic acid can reduce the rednessand pimples. Some patients who use these medicationsexperience skin irritation that tends to resolve with time.\\nFor later stages of the disorder, a surgical procedure\\nmay be needed to improve the appearance of the skin. Toremove the telangiectasias, a dermatologist may use anelectrocautery device to apply a current to the blood ves-sel in order to destroy it. Special lasers, called tunabledye lasers, can also be adjusted to selectively destroythese tiny blood vessels.\\nA variety of surgical techniques can be used to\\nimprove the shape and appearance of a bulbous nose inthe later stages of the disease. Surgeons may use ascalpel or laser to remove excess tissue from the noseand restore a more natural appearance.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments have not been extensively\\nstudied in rosacea. Some reports advocate gentle circularmassage for several minutes daily to the nose, cheeks,and forehead. Scientifically controlled studies are lack-\\ning, however.\\nMany people are able to avoid outbreaks by reduc-\\ning things that trigger flushing. Alcoholic beverages, hotbeverages, and spicy foods are among the more commonfactors in the diet that can provoke flushing. Reducing oreliminating these items in the diet can help limit rosaceaoutbreaks in many people. Exposure to heat, cold, andsunlight are also known triggers of flushing. The specificthings that provoke flushing vary considerably from per-son to person, however. It usually takes some trial anderror to figure these out.\\nA deficiency in hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the stom-\\nach may be a cause of rosacea, and supplementation withHCl capsules may bring relief in some cases.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for controlling symptoms of rosacea\\nand improving the appearance of the face is good. Manypeople require life-long treatment and achieve goodresults. There is no known cure for the disorder.\\nPrevention\\nRosacea cannot be prevented, but once correctly\\ndiagnosed, outbreaks can be treated and repeatedepisodes can be limited.\\nUse mild soaps\\nAvoiding anything that irritates the skin is a good\\npreventive measure for people with rosacea. Mild soapsand cleansers are recommended. Astringents and alcoholshould be avoided.\\nLearn what triggers flushing\\nReducing factors in the diet and environment that\\ncause flushing of the face is another good preventivestrategy. Alcoholic and hot beverages, and spicy foodsare among the more common triggers.\\nUse sunscreen\\nLimiting exposure of the face to excesses of heat and\\ncold can also help. A sunscreen with a skin protectionfactor (SPF) of 15 or greater used daily can limit thedamage to the skin and small blood vessels caused by thesun, and reduce outbreaks.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBleicher, Paul A. “Rosacea.” In Manual of Clinical Problems in\\nDermatology , ed.

About 90% of all children have beenexposed to the virus, with about 33% actually demon-strating the syndrome of fever followed by rash.\\nThe most common age for a child to contract roseola\\nis between six and twelve months. Roseola infectionstrikes boys and girls equally. The infection may occur atany time of year, although late spring and early summerseem to be peak times for it.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAbout 85% of the time, roseola is caused by a virus\\ncalled Human Herpesvirus 6, or HHV-6. Although thevirus is related to those herpesviruses known to causesores on the lips or genitalia, HHV-6 causes a very differ-ent type of infection. HHV-6 is believed to be passedbetween people via infected saliva. A few other viruses(called enteroviruses) can produce a similar fever-then-rash illness, which is usually also called roseola.\\nResearchers believe that it takes about 5-15 days to\\ndevelop illness after having been infected by HHV-6.Roseola strikes suddenly, when a previously-well childspikes an impressively high fever. The temperature mayreach 106°F. As is always the case with sudden feverspikes, the extreme change in temperature may causecertain children to have seizures. About 5-35% of allchildren with roseola will have these “febrile seizures.”\\nThe most notable thing about this early phase of rose-\\nola is the absence of symptoms, other than the high fever.Although some children have a slightly reddened throat, ora slightly runny nose, most children have no symptomswhatsoever, other than the sudden development of highfever. This fever lasts for between three and five days.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2919Roseola\\nRoseola rash on infant’s back and shoulders. (Custom Med-\\nical Stock Photo.

As these names imply, the injury occurs mostfrequently in athletes practicing sports that require the armto be moved over the head repeatedly, such as pitching,swimming, tennis, and weight lifting. Rotator cuff ten-donitis is an inflammation of the shoulder tendons while arotator cuff tear is a ripping of one or more of the tendons.\\nThe tendons of four muscles make up the rotator cuff.\\nThe muscles are the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teresminor, and subscapularis. The tendons attach the musclesto four shoulder bones: the shoulder blade (scapula), theupper arm bone (humerus), and the collarbone (clavicles.)The rotator cuff tendons can also degenerate due to age,usually starting around age 40. Rotator cuff injury mayalso be caused by falling on the outstretched arm or jointof the elbow. Either of these may produce enough force todrive the humerus into the shoulder socket.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSome areas of the rotator cuff tendons have poor\\nblood supply. Thus, the tissue is very slow to heal and\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2920Rotator cuff injury'),\n",

Tearing and inflamma-\\ntion in athletes is usually due to hard and repetitive use,especially in baseball pitchers. In non-athletes over age 40,the injuries usually occur as a result of lifting heavyobjects. The two primary symptoms are pain and weak-\\nness in the shoulder or arm, especially with arm movementor at night. A partial tear may cause pain but still allownormal arm movement. A complete tear usually leaves theinjured person unable to raise the arm away from the side.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is usually made after a physical examina-\\ntion, often by a sports medicine physician. X rays are also\\nsometimes used in diagnosis as well as an arthrogram.However, the arthrogram is an invasive procedure andmay be painful afterwards. For this reason, magnetic res-\\nonance imaging (MRI) is preferred to determine tendon\\ntears as it also show greater detail than the arthrogram.\\nTreatment\\nThe primary treatment is resting the shoulder and,\\nfor minor tears and inflammation, applying ice packs.Anti-inflammatory medications may also be prescribed.As soon as pain decreases, physical therapy is usuallystarted to help regain normal motion. If pain persistsafter several weeks, the physician may inject cortisoneinto the affected area.\\nSerious tears to the rotator cuff tendons usually\\nrequire surgery to repair. An instrument called an arthro-scope is used to view the shoulder joint and confirm thepresence of a tear. The arthroscope can also be used toremove any bone spurs that may be present in the shoul-der area. Current arthroscopic procedures usually involvea 2-in (5.1cm) incision in the outer shoulder. Throughthis incision the torn rotator edge may be reattached tothe humerus with stitches.\\nAlternative treatment\\nThere are no effective alternative medicine treat-\\nments for rotator cuff injuries.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for recovery from minor rotator cuff\\ninjuries is excellent. For serious injuries, the prognosis isusually good, some six weeks of physical therapy beingrequired following surgery. Full recovery may take sever-al more months. In some cases, the injury is so severethat it requires tendon grafts and muscle transfers. In rarecases, a severe injury is not repairable, usually becausethe tendon has been torn for too long a time.KEY TERMS\\nArthrogram —A test done by injecting dye into the\\nshoulder joint and then taking x rays.

The infection is highlycontagious and may lead to severe dehydration (loss of\\nbody fluids) and even death. In the United States, morethan 50,000 children are hospitalized and up to 125 dieeach year as a result of rotavirus infection.\\nDescription\\nGastroenteritis , or inflammation of the stomach\\nand the intestine, is the second most common illness inthe United States, after the common cold . More than\\none-third of such cases are caused by viruses. Many dif-ferent viruses can cause gastroenteritis, but the mostcommon ones are the rotavirus and the Norwalk virus.\\nThe name rotavirus comes from the Latin word\\n“rota” for wheel and is given because the viruses have adistinct wheel-like shape. Rotavirus infection is alsoknown as infantile diarrhea, or winter diarrhea, becauseit mainly targets infants and young children. The out-breaks are usually in the cooler months of winter.\\nThe virus is classified into different groups (Group A\\nthrough group G), depending on the type of protein marker(antigen) that is present on its surface. The diarrheal infec-tion of children is caused by the Group A rotaviruses. GroupB rotaviruses have caused major epidemics of adult diarrheain China. Group C rotavirus has been associated with rarecases of diarrheal outbreaks in Japan and England. GroupsD through G have not been detected in humans.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe main symptoms of the rotavirus infection are\\nfever , stomach cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea (this\\ncould lead to severe dehydration). The symptoms lastanywhere from four to six days. If a child has dry lipsand tongue, dry skin, sunken eyes, and wets fewer thansix diapers a day, it is a sign of dehydration and a physi-cian needs to be notified. Because of the excellence ofhealthcare in this country, rotavirus is rarely fatal toAmerican children. However, it causes deaths of up to amillion children in the third world countries, every year.\\nThe virus is usually spread by the “fecal-oral route.” In\\nother words, a child can catch a rotavirus infection if sheputs her finger in her mouth after touching toys or thingsthat have been contaminated by the stool of another infect-ed child. This usually happens when children do not washtheir hands after using the toilet, or before eating food.\\nThe viruses can also spread by way of contaminated\\nfood and drinking water. Infected food handlers who pre-pare salads, sandwiches, and other foods that require nocooking can spread the disease. Generally, symptomsappear within 4–48 hours after exposure to the contami-nated food or water.\\nChildren between the ages of six months and two\\nyears, especially in a daycare setting, are the most sus-ceptible to this infection. Breastfed babies may be lesslikely to become infected, because breast milk containsantibodies (proteins produced by the white blood cells ofthe immune system) that fight the illness. Nearly everychild by the age of four has been infected by this virus,and has rotavirus antibodies in their body. The diseasealso targets the elderly and people who have weakimmune systems.\\nChildren who have been infected once can be infected\\nagain. However, second infections are less severe than thefirst infections. By the time a child has had two infections,the chances of subsequent severe infection is remote.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe rotavirus infection is diagnosed by identifying the\\nvirus in the patient’s stool. This is done using electronmicroscopy. Immunological tests such as ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) are also widely used fordiagnosis, and several commercial kits are available.\\nTreatment\\n“Oral rehydration therapy,” or drinking enough fluids\\nto replace those lost through bowel movements and vom-iting, is the primary aim of the treatment. Electrolyte andfluid replacement solutions are available over the counterin food and drug stores. Dehydration is one of the greatestdangers for infants and young children. If the diarrheabecomes severe, it may be necessary to hospitalize thepatient so that fluids can be administered intravenously.\\nAnti-diarrheal medication should not be given to\\nchildren unless directed to do so by the physician.Antibiotic therapy is not useful in viral illness. Specificdrugs for the virus are not available.\\nPrognosis\\nMost of the infections resolve spontaneously. Dehy-\\ndration due to severe diarrhea is one of the major compli-cations.\\nPrevention\\nThe best way to prevent the disease is by proper\\nfood handling and thorough hand washing, after usingthe toilet and whenever hands are soiled. In child carecenters and hospital settings, the staff should be educated\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2922Rotavirus infections'),\n",

Researchers reportthat the vaccines appear to prevent the infection in 80%of the tested children. The vaccine is intended to be givenorally (by mouth) at two, four, and six months of age.The only side effect of the vaccine is a low-grade fever ina small percentage of the children, three to four daysafter the vaccination .

Nema-todes are parasitic worms with long, cylindrical bodies.Description\\nRoundworm infections are widespread throughout\\nthe world, with some regional differences. Ascariasis andtrichuriasis are more common in warm, moist climateswhere people use human or animal feces for fertilizer.Anisakiasis is most common in countries where raw orpickled fish or squid is a popular food item.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe causes and symptoms of roundworm infection\\nvary according to the species. Humans acquire mosttypes of roundworm infection from contaminated food orby touching the mouth with unwashed hands.\\nAnisakiasis\\nAnisakiasis is caused by anisakid roundworms.\\nHumans are not the primary host for these parasites.Anisakid roundworms infest whales, seals, and dolphins;crabs then ingest roundworm eggs from the feces ofthese animals. In the crabs, the eggs hatch into larvae thatcan infect fish. The larvae enter the muscles of marineanimals further up the food chain, including squid, mack-erel, herring, cod, salmon, tuna, and halibut. Humansbecome accidental hosts when they eat raw or under-cooked fish containing anisakid larvae. The larvae attachthemselves to the tissues lining the stomach and intes-tine, and eventually die inside the inflamed tissue.\\nIn humans, anisakiasis can produce a severe syndrome\\nthat affects the stomach and intestines, or a mild chronicdisease that may last for weeks or years. In acute anisakia-sis, symptoms begin within one to seven hours after thepatient eats infected seafood. Patients are often violentlysick, with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea , and severe abdomi-\\nnal pain that may resemble appendicitis . In chronic\\nanisakiasis, the patient has milder forms of stomach orintestinal irritation that resemble stomach ulcers or irrita-\\nble bowel syndrome . In some cases, the acute form of the\\ndisease is followed by chronic infestation.\\nAscariasis\\nAscariasis, which is caused by Ascaris lumbricoides ,\\nis one of the most widespread parasitic infections inhumans, affecting over 1.3 billion people worldwide.Ascarid roundworms cause a larger burden on the humanhost than any other parasite; adult worms can grow aslong as 12 or 14 inches, and release 200,000 eggs per day.The eggs infect people who eat unwashed vegetablesfrom contaminated soil or touch their mouths withunwashed hands. Once inside the digestive tract, the eggsrelease larvae that penetrate the intestinal wall andmigrate to the lungs through the liver and the blood-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2923Roundworm infections\\nRotaviruses are probably the most common viruses to\\ninfect humans and animals.These viruses are associatedwith gastroenteritis and diarrhea in humans and other ani-mals.

After about 10 days in the lungs, the larvae\\nmigrate further into the patient’s upper lung passages andairway, where they are swallowed. When they return tothe intestine, they mature into adults and reproduce. Thetime period from the beginning of the infection to eggproduction is 60–75 days.\\nThe first symptoms of infection may occur when the\\nlarvae reach the lungs. The patient may develop chestpain, coughing, difficulty breathing, and inflammation ofthe lungs. In some cases, the patient’s sputum is streakedwith blood. This phase of the disease is sometimes calledLoeffler’s syndrome. It is marked by an accumulation ofparasites in the lung tissue and by eosinophilia (an abnor-mal increase in the number of a specific type of whiteblood cell). The intestinal phase of ascariasis is markedby stomach pain, cramping, nausea, and intestinal block-age in severe cases.\\nToxocariasis\\nToxocariasis is sometimes called visceral larva\\nmigrans (VLM) because the larval form of the organismhatches inside the intestines and migrates throughout thebody to other organs (viscera). The disease is caused byToxocara canis and T. cati , which live within the\\nintestines of dogs and cats. Most human patients are chil-dren between the ages of two and four years, who becomeinfected after playing in sandboxes or soil contaminatedby pet feces, although adults are also susceptible. Theeggs can survive in soil for as long as seven years.\\nThe organism’s eggs hatch inside the human intes-\\ntine and release larvae that are carried in the bloodstreamto all parts of the body, including the eyes, liver, lungs,heart, and brain. The patient usually has a fever , with\\ncoughing or wheezing and a swollen liver. Some\\npatients develop skin rashes and inflammation of the\\nlungs. The larvae may survive inside the body formonths, producing allergic reactions and small granulo-mas, which are tissue swellings or growths produced inresponse to inflammation. Infection of the eye can pro-duce ocular larva migrans (OLM), which is the firstsymptom of toxocariasis in some patients.\\nTrichuriasis\\nTrichuriasis, caused by Trichuris trichiura , is some-\\ntimes called whipworm because the organism has a long,slender, whiplike front end. The adult worm is slightlyless than an inch long. Trichuriasis is most common inwarm, humid climates, including the southeastern UnitedStates. The number of people with trichuriasis may be ashigh as 800 million worldwide.\\nWhipworm larvae hatch from swallowed eggs in the\\nsmall intestine and move on to the upper part of the largeintestine, where they attach themselves to the lining. The\\nadult worms produce eggs that are passed in the feces andmature in the soil. Patients with mild infections may havefew or no symptoms. In cases of heavy infestation, thepatient may have abdominal cramps and other symptomsresembling amebic dysentery. In children, severe trichuri-asis may cause anemia and developmental retardation.\\nDiagnosis\\nSince the first symptoms of roundworm infection are\\ncommon to a number of illnesses, a doctor is most likelyto consider the possibility of a parasitic disease on thebasis of the patient’s history—especially in children. Thedefinite diagnosis is based on the results of stool or tissuetests. In trichuriasis, adult worms may also be visible inthe lining of the patient’s rectum. In ascariasis, adultworms may appear in the patient’s feces or vomit; theycan also be detected by x ray and ultrasound. In toxocari-asis, larvae are sometimes found in tissue samples takenfrom a granuloma. If a patient with toxocariasis developsOLM, it is important to obtain a granuloma sample inorder to distinguish between OLM and retinoblastoma\\n(a type of eye tumor).\\nAnisakiasis is one of two roundworm infections that\\ncannot be diagnosed from stool specimens. Instead, thediagnosis is made by x rays of the patient’s stomach andsmall intestine. The larvae may appear as small threadswhen double contrast x rays are used. In acute cases, thedoctor may use an endoscope (an instrument for examiningthe interior of a body cavity) to look for or remove larvae.\\nBlood tests cannot be used to differentiate among\\ndifferent types of roundworm infections, but the presenceof eosinophilia can help to confirm the diagnosis.\\nPatients with trichuriasis or ascariasis should be\\nexamined for signs of infection by other roundwormspecies; many patients are infected by several parasites atthe same time.\\nTreatment\\nTrichuriasis, ascariasis, and toxocariasis are treated\\nwith anthelminthic medications. These are drugs thatdestroy roundworms either by paralyzing them or byblocking them from feeding. Anthelminthic drugsinclude pyrantel pamoate, piperazine, albendazole, andmebendazole. Mebendazole cannot be given to pregnantwomen because it may harm the fetus. Treatment withanthelminthic drugs does not prevent reinfection.\\nThere is no drug treatment for anisakiasis; however,\\nsymptoms usually resolve in one to two weeks when thelarvae die. In some cases, the larvae are removed with anendoscope or by surgery.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2924Roundworm infections'),\n",

If suc-tion fails, the worms must be removed surgically to pre-vent intestinal rupture or blockage.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for recovery from roundworm infec-\\ntions is good for most patients. The severity of infection,however, varies considerably from person to person.Children are more likely to have heavy infestations andare also more likely to suffer from malabsorption andmalnutrition than adults.\\nAscariasis is the only roundworm infection with a\\nsignificant mortality rate. A. lumbricoides grows large\\nenough to perforate the bile or pancreatic ducts; in addi-tion, a mass of worms in the digestive tract can causerupture or blockage of the intestines.

(Custom Medical Stock\\nPhoto. Reproduced by permission.)Rubella\\nDefinition\\nRubella is a highly contagious viral disease, spread\\nthrough contact with discharges from the nose and throatof an infected person. Although rubella causes only mildsymptoms of low fever , swollen glands, joint pain , and a\\nfine red rash in most children and adults, it can havesevere complications for women in their first trimester ofpregnancy . These complications include severe birth\\ndefects or death of the fetus.\\nDescription\\nRubella is also called German measles or three-day\\nmeasles. This disease was once a common childhood ill-ness, but its occurrence has been drastically reducedsince vaccine against rubella became available in 1969.In the 20 years following the introduction of the vaccine,reported rubella cases dropped 99.6%. Only 229 cases ofrubella were reported in the United States in 1996.\\nRubella is spread through contact with fluid droplets\\nexpelled from the nose or throat of an infected person. Aperson infected with the rubella virus is contagious forabout seven days before any symptoms appear and con-tinues to be able to spread the disease for about four daysafter the appearance of symptoms. Rubella has an incu-bation period of 12–23 days.\\nAlthough rubella is generally considered a childhood\\nillness, people of any age who have not been vaccinated orpreviously caught the disease can become infected. Hav-ing rubella once or being immunized against rubella nor-mally gives lifetime immunity. This is why vaccination is\\nso effective in reducing the number of rubella cases.\\nWomen of childbearing age who do not have immunity\\nagainst rubella should be the most concerned about gettingthe disease. Rubella infection during the first three monthsof pregnancy can cause a woman to miscarry or cause herbaby to be born with birth defects. Although it has beenpractically eradicated in the United States, rubella is stillcommon in less developed countries because of poor immu-nization penetration, creating a risk to susceptible travelers.Some countries have chosen to target rubella vaccination tofemales only and outbreaks in foreign-born males haveoccurred on cruise ships and at U.S. summer camps.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nRubella is caused by the rubella virus ( Rubivirus ).\\nSymptoms are generally mild, and complications are rarein anyone who is not pregnant.The first visible sign of rubella is a fine red rash that\\nbegins on the face and rapidly moves downward to coverthe whole body within 24 hours. The rash lasts about threedays, which is why rubella is sometimes called the three-day measles. A low fever and swollen glands, especially inthe head (around the ears) and neck, often accompany therash. Joint pain and sometimes joint swelling can occur,more often in women. It is quite common to get rubellaand not show any symptoms (subclinical infection).\\nSymptoms disappear within three to four days,\\nexcept for joint pain, which may linger for a week or two.Most people recover fully with no complications. Howev-er, severe complications may arise in the unborn childrenof women who get rubella during the first three months oftheir pregnancy. These babies may be miscarried or still-born. A high percentage are born with birth defects. Birthdefects are reported to occur in 50% of women who con-tract the disease during the first month of pregnancy, 20%of those who contract it in the second month, and 10% ofthose who contract it in the third month.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2926Rubella'),\n",

Taken togeth-\\ner, these conditions are called congenital rubella syn-drome (CRS). The risk of birth defects drops after thefirst trimester, and by the 20th week, there are rarely anycomplications.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe rash caused by the rubella virus and the accom-\\npanying symptoms are so similar to other viral infectionsthat it is impossible for a physician to make a confirmeddiagnosis on visual examination alone. The only sureway to confirm a case of rubella is by isolating the viruswith a blood test or in a laboratory culture.\\nA blood test is done to check for rubella antibodies.\\nWhen the body is infected with the rubella virus, it pro-duces both immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobu-lin M (IgM) antibodies to fight the infection. Once IgGexists, it persists for a lifetime, but the special IgM anti-body usually wanes over six months. A blood test can beused either to confirm a recent infection (IgG and IgM)or determine whether a person has immunity to rubella(IgG only). The lack of antibodies indicates that a personis susceptible to rubella.\\nAll pregnant women should be tested for rubella\\nearly in pregnancy, whether or not they have a history ofvaccination. If the woman lacks immunity, she is coun-seled to avoid anyone with the disease and to be vacci-nated after giving birth.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no drug treatment for rubella. Bed rest, flu-\\nids, and acetaminophen for pain and temperatures over\\n102°F (38.9°C) are usually all that is necessary.\\nBabies born with suspected CRS are isolated and\\ncared for only by people who are sure they are immune torubella. Congenital heart defects are treated with surgery.\\nAlternative treatment\\nRather than vaccinating a healthy child against\\nrubella, many alternative practitioners recommend allow-ing the child to contract the disease naturally at the age offive or six years, since the immunity conferred by con-tracting the disease naturally lasts a lifetime. It is, howev-er, difficult for a child to contract rubella naturally wheneveryone around him or her has been vaccinated.\\nAyurvedic practitioners recommend making the\\npatient comfortable and giving the patient ginger or clovetea to hasten the progress of the disease. Traditional Chi-nese medicine uses a similar approach. Believing that\\ninducing the skin rash associated with rubella hastens theprogress of the disease, traditional Chinese practitionersprescribe herbs such as peppermint ( Mentha piperita ) and\\nchai-hu (Bupleurum chinense ). Cicada is often prescribed\\nas well. Western herbal remedies may be used to alleviaterubella symptoms. Distilled witch hazel ( Hamamelis vir-\\nginiana ) helps calm the itching associated with the skin\\nrash and an eyewash made from a filtered diffusion ofeyebright ( Euphrasia officinalis ) can relieve eye discom-\\nfort. Antiviral western herbal or Chinese remedies can beused to assist the immune system in establishing equilib-rium during the healing process. Depending on thepatient’s symptoms, among the remedies a homeopathmay prescribe are Belladonna,Pulsatilla, or Phytolacca .\\nPrognosis\\nComplications from rubella infection are rare in chil-\\ndren, pregnant women past the 20th week of pregnancy,and other adults. For women in the first trimester of preg-nancy, there is a high likelihood of the child being bornwith one or more birth defect. Unborn children exposedto rubella early in pregnancy are also more likely to bemiscarried, stillborn, or have a low birthweight.

It is sometimesKEY TERMS\\nIncubation period —The time it takes for a person\\nto become sick after being exposed to a disease.\\nTrimester —The first third or 13 weeks of pregnancy.also used to screen women of childbearing age before the\\nfirst pregnancy .\\nPurpose\\nThe test is given to evaluate whether a woman is\\nimmune to rubella (German measles ) as a result of child-\\nhood exposure or immunization, or whether she may bepresently infected with the disease. The question of acurrent infection is particularly urgent for pregnantwomen. Although the disease itself is not serious inadults, it can cause miscarriage ,stillbirth , or damage to\\nthe fetus during the first trimester (three months) of preg-nancy. The rubella test is regarded as a more reliableindication of the patient’s immune status than her history,because reinfection with rubella is possible even afterimmunization. The results of the test may influence deci-sions to terminate a pregnancy.\\nDescription\\nThe rubella test belongs to a category of blood tests\\ncalled hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests. Hemaggluti-nation refers to the clumping or clustering of red blood cellscaused by a disease antibody, virus, or certain other sub-stances. Inhibition refers to interference with the clumpingprocess. The presence of rubella antibodies inhibits the cellclumping caused by the rubella virus. Thus, the addition ofthe virus to a sample of the patient’s blood allows a doctorto determine the presence and concentration of rubella anti-bodies and the patient’s immunity to the disease.\\nWhen a person is infected with the rubella virus, the\\nbody produces both immunoglobulin G (IgG) andimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to fight the infec-tion. Once IgG exists, it persists for a lifetime, but thespecial IgM antibody usually wanes over six months.The rubella test can either confirm that a recent infectionhas occurred (both IgG and IgM are present) or that apatient has immunity to rubella (IgG only is present).\\nWhen the test is performed to confirm the diagnosis\\nof rubella in a woman already pregnant, two blood sam-ples are drawn. One is drawn during the acute phase ofthe illness about three days after the rash breaks out, andthe second is drawn during the convalescent phase aboutthree weeks later. The specimens are then tested simulta-neously by a single laboratory. Alternatively, a pregnantwoman with a rash suspected to be rubella can be testedfor IgM antibody. If the test shows that IgM antibody ispresent, then a recent rubella infection has occurred.\\nNormal results\\nIf the patient has been successfully immunized\\nagainst rubella or has had the disease, the HI antibody\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2928Rubella test'),\n",

The\\nred blood cells will fail to clump when the rubella virusis added to the blood serum.\\nIn the case of paired testing for pregnant women, a\\nfourfold rise in antibody titer between the first and sec-ond blood samples indicates the suspicious rash wascaused by rubella. The alternative test for IgM antibodyconfirms recent rubella infection if IgM is found in thepatient’s blood.KEY TERMS\\nAntibody —A protein molecule produced by the\\nimmune system that is specific to a virus, such asthe rubella virus.

The bones are held in place and allowed limitedmovements by a system of sacroiliac ligaments. Relax-ation of this and other joints and ligaments is importantduring pregnancy and is accomplished by a special hor-\\nmone called relaxin. Usually the sacroiliac is damagedby high-impact injuries. These injuries may be lifethreatening and mortality is approximately 20% if neigh-boring structures are also damaged. Injuries to this areaoften includes neurological deficits. Dislocation andnerve damage are frequently missed in the diagnosis.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe primary cause of dislocations, fractures , and\\naccompanying damage is usually a traumatic accident.Patients receiving such injuries require emergency med-ical attention. There may be severe blood loss due tobreakage of large bones and resuscitative measures maybe required for stabilization.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis can be difficult since nerve damage\\ncan mimic other conditions with similar symptoms (i.e.,low back pain in persons with sciatica ). Additionally\\nimaging studies and physical examination maneuvers\\nwill miss the diagnosis. The definitive method for diag-nosing sacroiliac pathology would be injection of localanesthetic in the correct area of the affected sacroiliacjoint. This procedure is usually performed using advanceguidance systems (CT or fluoroscopic assisted guid-ance). If the pain is relieved by anesthetic injection, then\\nthe diagnosis is confirmed. There are three typical pat-terns of pain: pain directly over the joint, pain in thegroin extending down the affected leg that can mimic thesigns associated with a herniated lumbar disc, and painwidely dispersed in the affected leg.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment initially can include emergency interven-\\ntions, but usually is conservative. Treatment includesphysical therapy, manipulation, and medications for paincontrol. In some cases a sacroiliac belt can help withsymptoms. In sacroiliac joint disease that has alreadyprogressed and is chronic and severe, corrective jointfusion may be indicated.\\nPrognosis\\nOutcome is variable and takes into account the\\nextent of injuries, early diagnosis, and responsiveness toconservative treatment.\\nPrevention\\nThere is no known prevention since the disease is\\nsecondary to an accident.S\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2931KEY TERMS\\nHerniated disk —A protrusion in a disk located in\\nthe spinal column.\\nLigament —Fibrous tissue which connect bones.\\nSynovial joint —A joint that allows for bone move-\\nment.GEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 2931'),\n",

In saliva there are enzymes, or catalysts,that begin the breakdown (digestion) of food while it isstill in the mouth. The glands are called salivary glandsbecause of their function.\\nThere are three big pairs of salivary glands in addi-\\ntion to many smaller ones. The parotid glands, sub-mandibular glands and sublingual glands are the large,paired salivary glands. The parotids are located inside thecheeks, one below each ear. The submandibular glandsare located on the floor of the mouth, with one on theinner side of each part of the lower jaw, or mandible. Thesublingual glands are also in the floor of the mouth, butthey are under the tongue.\\nThe parotids are the salivary glands most often\\naffected by tumors. Yet most of the tumors that grow inthe parotid glands are benign, or not cancerous. Approxi-mately 8 out of 10 salivary tumors diagnosed are in aparotid gland. One in 10 diagnosed is in a submandibulargland. The remaining 10% are diagnosed in other sali-vary glands.\\nIn general, glands more likely to show tumor growth\\nare also glands least likely to show malignant tumorgrowth. Thus, although tumors of the sublingual glands arerare, almost all of them are malignant. In contrast, aboutone in four tumors of the parotid glands is malignant.Cancers of the salivary glands begin to grow in\\nepithelial cells, or the flat cells that cover body surfaces.Thus, they are called carcinomas, cancers that by defini-tion begin in epithelial cells.\\nDemographics\\nAbout 7% of all cancers diagnosed in the head and\\nneck region are diagnosed in a salivary gland. Men andwomen are at equal risk.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nWhen survivors of the 1945 atomic bombings of\\nNagasaki and Hiroshima began to develop salivary glandtumors at a high rate, radiation was suspected as a cause.Ionizing radiation is a factor that contributes to tumordevelopment. So is radiation therapy . Adults who\\nreceived radiation therapy for enlarged adenoids or ton-sils when they were children, are at greater risk for sali-vary gland tumors.\\nThere seems to be some link between breast cancer\\nand salivary gland tumors. Women with breast cancer are\\nmore likely to be diagnosed with salivary gland tumors.Also linked to salivary gland tumors is alcohol use, expo-sure to sunlight (ultraviolet radiation) and hair dye use.There is evidence that people infected with herpes virusesmay be at greater risk for salivary gland tumors. Individu-als infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\\nhave more salivary gland disease in general, and may beat greater risk for salivary gland tumors.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2933Salivary gland tumors\\nA salivary gland with a tumor.

Calabrese\\nSalmonella food poisoning\\nDefinition\\nSalmonella food poisoning is a bacterial food poi-\\nsoning caused by the Salmonella bacterium. It results in\\nthe swelling of the lining of the stomach and intestines(gastroenteritis ). While domestic and wild animals,\\nincluding poultry, pigs, cattle, and pets such as turtles,iguanas, chicks, dogs, and cats can transmit this illness,most people become infected by ingesting foods contam-inated with significant amounts of Salmonella .\\nDescription\\nSalmonella food poisoning occurs worldwide, how-\\never it is most frequently reported in North America andEurope. Only a small proportion of infected people aretested and diagnosed, and as few as 1% of cases are actu-ally reported. While the infection reate may seem rela-tively low, even an attack rate of less than 0.5% in such alarge number of exposures results in many infected indi-viduals. The poisoning typically occurs in small, local-ized outbreaks in the general population or in large out-breaks in hospitals, restaurants, or institutions for chil-dren or the elderly. In the United States, Salmonella is\\nresponsible for about 15% of all cases of food poisoning.\\nImproperly handled or undercooked poultry and eggs\\nare the foods which most frequently cause Salmonellafood poisoning. Chickens are a major carrier of Salmonel-\\nlabacteria, which accounts for its prominence in poultryproducts. However, identifying foods which may be conta-\\nminated with Salmonella is particularly difficult because\\ninfected chickens typically show no signs or symptoms.Since infected chickens have no identifying characteris-tics, these chickens go on to lay eggs or to be used as meat.\\nAt one time, it was thought that Salmonella bacteria\\nwere only found in eggs which had cracked, thus allow-ing the bacteria to enter. Ultimately, it was learned that,because the egg shell has tiny pores, even uncracked eggswhich sat for a time on a surface (nest) contaminatedwith Salmonella could themselves become contaminated.\\nIt is known also that the bacteria can be passed from theinfected female chicken directly into the substance of theegg before the shell has formed around it.\\nAnyone may contract Salmonella food poisoning,\\nbut the disease is most serious in infants, the elderly, andindividuals with weakened immune systems. In theseindividuals, the infection may spread from the intestinesto the blood stream, and then to other body sites, causingdeath unless the person is treated promptly with antibi-\\notics . In addition, people who have had part or all of their\\nstomach or their spleens removed, or who have sicklecell anemia, cirrhosis of the liver, leukemia, lymphoma,\\nmalaria , louse-borne relapsing fever , or Acquired\\nImmunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) are particularly\\nsusceptible to Salmonella food poisoning.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSalmonella food poisoning can occur when someone\\ndrinks unpasteurized milk or eats undercooked chickenor eggs, or salad dressings or desserts which contain raweggs. Even if Salmonella -containing foods such as chick-\\nen are thoroughly cooked, any food can become contami-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2935Salmonella food poisoning\\nSalmonella enteritidis.

In addi-tion, children have become ill after playing with turtlesor iguanas, and then eating without washing their hands.Because the bacteria are shed in the feces for weeks afterinfection with Salmonella , poor hygiene can allow such a\\ncarrier to spread the infection to others.\\nSymptoms appear about one-two days after infec-\\ntion, and include fever (in 50% of patients), nausea and\\nvomiting ,diarrhea , and abdominal cramps and pain .\\nThe diarrhea is usually very liquid, and rarely containsmucus or blood. Diarrhea usually lasts for about fourdays. The illness usually ends in about five-seven days.\\nSerious complications are rare, occurring most often\\nin individuals with other medical illnesses. Complica-tions occur when the Salmonella bacteria make their way\\ninto the bloodstream ( bacteremia ). Once in the blood-\\nstream, the bacteria can enter any organ system through-out the body, causing disease. Other infections which canbe caused by Salmonella include:\\n• bone infections ( osteomyelitis )\\n• joint infections (arthritis)• infection of the sac containing the heart ( pericarditis )\\n• infection of the tissues which cover the brain and spinal\\ncord ( meningitis )\\n• infection of the liver (hepatitis)\\n• lung infections ( pneumonia )\\n• infection of aneurysms (aneurysms are abnormal out-\\npouchings which occur in weak areas of the walls ofblood vessels)\\n• infections in the center of already-existing tumors or\\ncysts\\nDiagnosis\\nUnder appropriate laboratory conditions, Salmonella\\ncan be grown and then viewed under a microscope foridentification. Early in the infection, the blood is farmore likely to positively show a presence of the Salmo-\\nnella bacterium when a sample is grown on a nutrient\\nsubstance (culture) for identification purposes. Eventual-ly, however, positive cultures can be obtained from thestool and in some cases from a urine culture .\\nTreatment\\nEven though Salmonella food poisoning is a bacterial\\ninfection, most practitioners do not treat simple caseswith antibiotics. Studies have shown that using antibioticsdoes not usually reduce the length of time that the patient\\nis ill. Paradoxically, it appears that antibiotics do, howev-er, cause the patient to shed bacteria in their feces for alonger period of time. In order to decrease the length of\\ntime that a particular individual is a carrier who canspread the disease, antibiotics are generally not given.\\nIn situations where an individual has a more severe\\ntype of infection with Salmonella bacteria, a number of\\nantibiotics may be used. Chloramphenicol was the firstantibiotic successfully used to treat Salmonella food poi-soning. It is still a drug of choice in developing countriesbecause it is so inexpensive, although some resistancehas developed to it. Ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfon-amide have been used successfully in the treatment ofinfections caused by chloramphenicol-resistant strains.Newer types of anibiotics, such as cephalosporin orquinolone, are also effective. These drugs can be givenby mouth or through a needle in the vein (intravenously)for very ill patients. With effective antibiotic therapy,patients feel better in 24–48 hours, the temperaturereturns to normal in three to five days, and the patient isgenerally recovered by 10–14 days.\\nAlternative treatment\\nA number of alternative treatments have been rec-\\nommended for food poisoning. One very effective treat-ment that is stongly recommended is supplementationwith Lactobacillus acidophilus ,L. bulgaricus , and/or\\nBifidobacterium to restore essential bacteria in the diges-\\ntive tract. These preparations are available as powders,tablets, or capsules from health food stores; yogurt withlive L. acidophilus cultures can also be eaten. Fasting or\\na liquid-only diet is often used for food poisoning.Homeopathic treatment can work very effectively in thetreatment of Salmonella food poisoning. The appropriateremedy for the individual and his/her symptoms must beused to get the desired results. Some examples of reme-dies commonly used are Chamomilla ,Nux vomica ,\\nIpecac , and Colchicum . Juice therapy, including carrot,\\nbeet, and garlic juices, is sometimes recommended,although it can cause discomfort for some people. Char-coal tablets can help absorb toxins and remove themfrom the digestive tract through bowel elimination. Avariety of herbs with antibiotic action, including citrusseed extract, goldenseal ( Hydrastis canadensis ), and\\nOregon grape ( Mahonia aquifolium ), may also be effec-\\ntive in helping to resolve cases of food poisoning.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for uncomplicated cases of Salmonel-\\nla food poisoning is excellent.

Removal of one tube (unilateral salp-ingectomy) is usually performed if the tube has becomeinfected (a condition known as salpingitis).\\nSalpingectomy is also used to treat an ectopic preg-\\nnancy , a condition in which a fertilized egg has implant-\\ned in the tube instead of inside the uterus. In most cases,the tube is removed only after drug treatments designedto save the structure have failed. (Women with oneremaining fallopian tube are still able to get pregnant andcarry a pregnancy to term.) The other alternative to salp-\\ningectomy is surgery to remove the fetus from the fallop-ian tube, followed by surgery to repair the tube.\\nA bilateral salpingectomy (removal of both the\\ntubes) is usually done if the ovaries and uterus are alsogoing to be removed. If the fallopian tubes and theovaries are both removed at the same time, this is called asalpingo-oophorectomy . A salpingo-oophorectomy is\\nnecessary when treating ovarian and endometrial can-\\ncerbecause the fallopian tubes and ovaries are the most\\ncommon sites to which cancer may spread.\\nDescription\\nRegional or general anesthesia may be used. Often a\\nlaparoscope (a hollow tube with a light on one end) is usedin this type of operation, which means that the incision canbe much smaller and the recovery time much shorter.\\nIn this procedure, the surgeon makes a small inci-\\nsion just beneath the navel. The surgeon inserts a shorthollow tube into the abdomen and, if necessary, pumps incarbon dioxide gas in order to move intestines out of theway and better view the organs. After a wider doubletube is inserted on one side for the laparoscope, anothersmall incision is made on the other side through whichother instruments can be inserted. After the operation iscompleted, the tubes and instruments are withdrawn. Thetiny incisions are sutured and there is very little scarring.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2937SalpingectomyGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 2937'),\n",

In addition to\\nhaving no clear-cut understanding of the cause of sar-coidosis, researchers are also puzzled by its distribution inthe world population. In the United States, for example,10-17 times as many African-Americans are affected aswhite Americans. In Europe, whites are primarily affected.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2939SarcoidosisGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 2939'),\n",

Theprevalence figures for sarcoidosis are very unusual. In theUnited States, prevalence figures range from five(5/100,000 in the United States) for whites to 40 forblacks. In Europe, prevalence ranges from three in Poland,to 10 in France, to 64 in Sweden, to 200 for Irish womenliving in London. Furthermore, a person from a group withvery low prevalence who leaves his or her native land for asecond location with a higher prevalence will then havethe same risk as anyone living in that second location.\\nSarcoidosis affects both men and women, although\\nwomen are more likely to have the disorder. The averageage for diagnosis is around 20-40 years.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of sarcoidosis is not known. Because the\\ngranulomas are primarily made up of cells from theimmune system (macrophages and lymphocytes), animmune connection is strongly suspected. One of thetheories which has been put forth suggests that exposureto some toxic or infectious material starts up an immuneresponse. For some reason, the body is unable to stop theresponse, and it spreads from the original organ to otherorgans.\\nBecause sarcoidosis has been noted to occur in fami-\\nly groups, a genetic cause has also been suggested.Research shows that identical twins are more likely toboth have sarcoidosis than are nonidentical twins orother siblings.\\nSome cases of sarcoidosis occur without the patient\\neven noting any symptoms. These cases are often discov-ered by chance during routine chest x rays. Most cases ofsarcoidosis, however, begin with very nonspecific symp-toms, such as decreased energy, weakness, and a drycough . Occasionally, the cough is accompanied by some\\nmild pain in the breastbone (sternum). Some patients\\nnote that they are having unusual shortness of breath\\nwhile exercising. Some patients develop fever , decreased\\nappetite, and weight loss.\\nVirtually every system of the body has the potential\\nto suffer the effects of sarcoidosis:\\n• tender reddish bumps (nodules) or patches often appear\\non the skin\\n• the eyes may become red and teary, and the vision blur-\\nry\\n• the joints may become swollen and painful (arthritis)• lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, and groin become\\nenlarged and tender, lymph nodes within the chest,around the lungs, also become enlarged• fluid may accumulate around the lungs ( pleural effu-\\nsion), making breathing increasingly difficult\\n• nasal stuffiness is common, as well as a hoarse sound to\\nthe voice\\n• cysts in the bone may cause pain in the hands and feet,\\nor in other bony areas\\n• the bone marrow may decrease the production of all\\nblood cells; decreased number of red blood cells causesanemia, fewer white blood cells increases the chance ofinfections, fewer platelets can increase the chance ofbleeding\\n• the body’s ability to process calcium often becomes\\nabnormal, so that excess calcium passes through thekidneys and into the urine; this may cause kidney\\nstones to form\\n• the liver may become enlarged• the heart may suffer a variety of complications, includ-\\ning abnormal or missed beats ( arrhythmias ), inflam-\\nmation of the covering of the heart ( pericarditis ), and\\nan increasing tendency toward weak, ineffective pump-ing of the blood (heart failure)\\n• the nervous system may display the effects of sarcoido-\\nsis by hearing loss , chronic inflammation of the cover-\\nings of the brain and spinal cord ( meningitis ), abnor-\\nmalities of the nerve that is involved in vision (opticnerve dysfunction), seizures, and the development ofpsychiatric disorders\\nAny, all, or even none of the above symptoms may\\nbe present in sarcoidosis.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis depends on information from a number of\\nsources, including the patient’s symptoms, the physical\\nexamination , x-ray pictures of the chest, and a number\\nof other laboratory examinations of blood or other tissue.None of these categories of information are sufficient tomake the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

A variety of lung function testsmay show abnormal results in sarcoidosis.\\nOther types of tests may be abnormal in sarcoidosis.\\nThe abnormal test results may also indicate other diseases.They include an elevation of a substance called angiotensin-converting enzyme in the blood, and an increased amount ofcalcium present in 24 hours worth of urine.\\nBronchoscopy is a very helpful diagnostic test. This\\ninvolves passing a tiny tube (bronchoscope) through thenose or mouth, down the trachea, and into the airways(bronchial tubes). The bronchial tubes can be inspectedthrough the bronchoscope. The bronchoscope is alsodesigned in such a way as to allow biopsies to be obtained.Bronchoalveolar lavage involves washing the surfaceswith a sterile saltwater (saline) solution. The saline is thenretrieved and examined in a laboratory. Cells and debrisfrom within the bronchial tubes and the tiny sacs of thelung (the alveoli) will be obtained in this way, and can bestudied for the presence of an abnormally large number ofwhite blood cells.

Malignant primary bone tumors arecharacterized as either:\\n• bone cancers which originate in the hard material of the\\nbone.\\n• soft-tissue sarcomas which begin in blood vessels,\\nnerves, or tissues containing muscles, fat, or fiber.\\nTypes of bone tumors\\nOsteogenic sarcoma, or osteosarcoma, is the most\\ncommon form of bone cancer, accounts for 6% of allinstances of the disease, and for about 5% of all cancersthat occur in children. Nine hundred new cases ofosteosarcoma are diagnosed in the United States everyyear. The disease usually affects teenagers, and is almosttwice as common in boys as in girls.\\nOsteosarcomas, which grow very rapidly, can devel-\\nop in any bone but most often occur along the edge or onthe end of one of the fast-growing long bones that supportthe arms and legs. About 80% of all osteosarcomas devel-op in the parts of the upper and lower leg nearest the knee(the distal femur or in the proximal tibia). The next likelylocation for an osteosarcoma is the bone of the upper armclosest to the shoulder (the proximal humerus).\\nEwing’s sarcoma is the second most common form of\\nchildhood bone cancer. Accounting for fewer than 5% ofbone tumors in children, Ewing’s sarcoma usually beginsin the soft tissue (the marrow) inside bones of the leg, hips,ribs, and arms. It rapidly infiltrates the lungs, and maymetastasize to bones in other parts of the body.\\nMore than 80% of patients who have Ewing’s sarco-\\nma are white, and the disease most frequently affectschildren between ages 5-9, and young adults betweenages 20-30. About 27% of all cases of Ewing’s sarcomaoccur in children under age 10, and 64% occur in adoles-cents between ages 10-20.\\nChondrosarcomas are cancerous bone tumors that\\nmost often appear in middle age. Usually originating instrong connective tissue (cartilage) in ribs or leg or hipbones, chondrosarcomas grow slowly. They rarely spreadto the lungs. It takes years for a chondrosarcoma tometastasize to other parts of the body, and some of thesetumors never spread.\\nParosteal osteogenic sarcomas, fibrosarcomas, and\\nchordomas are rare. Parosteal osteosarcomas generallyinvolve both the bone and the membrane that covers it.\\nFibrosarcomas originate in the ends of the bones in thearm or leg, and then spread to soft tissue. Chordomasdevelop on the skull or spinal cord.\\nOsteochondromas, which usually develop between\\nage 10-20, are the most common noncancerous primarybone tumors. Giant cell tumors generally develop in asection of the thigh bone near the knee. Giant cell tumorsare originally benign but sometimes become malignant.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of bone cancer is unknown, but the ten-\\ndency to develop it may be inherited. Children who havebone tumors are often tall for their age, and the diseaseseems to be associated with growth spurts that occur dur-ing childhood and adolescence. Injuries can make thepresence of tumors more apparent but do not cause them.\\nA bone that has been broken or exposed to high\\ndoses of radiation used to treat other cancers is morelikely than other bones to develop osteosarcoma. A histo-ry of noncancerous bone disease also increases bone-cancer risk.\\nThe amount of radiation in diagnostic x rays poses\\nlittle or no danger of bone-cancer development, but chil-dren who have a family history of the most commonchildhood cancer of the eye ( retinoblastoma ), or who\\nhave inherited rare cancer syndromes have a greater-than-average risk of developing bone cancer. Exposure tochemicals found in some paints and dyes can slightlyraise the risk.\\nBoth benign and malignant bone tumors can distort\\nand weaken bone and cause pain , but benign tumors are\\ngenerally painless and asymptomatic.\\nIt is sometimes possible to feel a lump or mass, but\\npain in the affected area is the most common early symp-tom of bone cancer. Pain is not constant in the initialstages of the disease, but it is aggravated by activity andmay be worse at night. If the tumor is located on a legbone, the patient may limp. Swelling and weakness of thelimb may not be noticed until weeks after the pain began.\\nOther symptoms of bone cancer include:\\n• a bone that breaks for no apparent reason\\n• difficulty moving the affected part of the body• fatigue•f e v e r• a lump on the trunk, an arm or leg, or another bone\\n• persistent, unexplained back pain\\n• weight loss\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2942SarcomasGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 2942'),\n",

An excisional biopsy is the surgical removal of asmall, accessible tumor. An incisional biopsy is per-formed on tumors too large or inaccessible to be com-pletely removed. The surgeon performing an incisionalbiopsy cuts into the patient’s skin and removes a portionof the exposed tumor. Performed under local or generalanesthetic, biopsy reveals whether a tumor is benign ormalignant and identifies the type of cancer cells themalignant tumor contains.\\nBone cancer is usually diagnosed about three\\nmonths after symptoms first appear, and 20% of malig-nant tumors have metastasized to the lungs or other partsof the body by that time.\\nImaging techniques\\nThe following procedures are used, in conjunction\\nwith biopsy, to diagnose bone cancer:\\n• Bone x rays. These x rays usually provide a clear image\\nof osteosarcomas.\\n• Computerized axial tomography (CAT scan) is a spe-\\ncialized x ray that uses a rotating beam to obtaindetailed information about an abnormality and its phys-ical relationship to other parts of the body. A CAT scancan differentiate between osteosarcomas and othertypes of bone tumors, illustrate how tumor cells haveinfiltrated other tissues, and help surgeons decidewhich portion of a growth would be best to biopsy.Because more than four of every five malignant bonetumors metastasize to the lungs, a CAT scan of thechest is performed to see if these organs have beenaffected. Chest and abdominal CAT scans are used todetermine whether Ewing’s sarcoma has spread to thelungs, liver, or lymph nodes.\\n• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a specialized\\nscan that relies on radio waves and powerful magnetsto reflect energy patterns created by tissue abnormali-ties and specific diseases. An MRI provides moredetailed information than does a CAT scan abouttumors and marrow cavities of the bone, and can some-times detect clusters of cancerous cells that have sepa-rated from the original tumor. This valuable informa-tion helps surgeons select the most appropriateapproach for treatment.• Radionuclide bone scans. These scans involve inject-\\ning a small amount of radioactive material into a vein.Primary tumors or cells that have metastasized absorbthe radioactive material and show up as dark spots onthe scan.\\nCytogenic and molecular genetic studies, which\\nassess the structure and composition of chromosomesand genes, may also be used to diagnose osteosarcoma.These tests can sometimes indicate what form of treat-ment is most appropriate.\\nLaboratory studies\\nA complete blood count (CBC) reveals abnormali-\\nties in the blood, and may indicate whether bone marrowhas been affected. A blood test that measures levels ofthe enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) can predict thelikelihood of a specific patient’s survival.\\nImmunohistochemistry involves adding special anti-\\nbodies and chemicals, or stains, to tumor samples.

The stage of a tumor suggests\\nwhich form of treatment is most appropriate, and predictshow the condition will probably respond to therapy.\\nAn osteosarcoma may be localized or metastatic. A\\nlocalized osteosarcoma has not spread beyond the bonewhere it arose or beyond nearby muscles, tendons, andother tissues. A metastatic osteosarcoma has spread tothe lungs, to bones not directly connected to the bone inwhich the tumor originated, or to other tissues or organs.\\nTreatment\\nSince the 1960s, when amputation was the only treat-\\nment for bone cancer, new chemotherapy drugs and inno-\\nvative surgical techniques have improved survival withintact limbs. Because osteosarcoma is so rare, patientsshould consider undergoing treatment at a major cancercenter staffed by specialists familiar with the disease.\\nA treatment plan for bone cancer, developed after\\nthe tumor has been diagnosed and staged, may include:\\n• Amputation. Amputation may be the only therapeutic\\noption for large tumors involving nerves or blood ves-sels that have not responded to chemotherapy. MRIscans indicate how much of the diseased limb must beremoved, and surgery is planned to create a cuff,formed of muscles and skin, around the amputatedbone. Following surgery, an artificial (prosthetic) leg isfitted over the cuff. A patient who actively participatesin the rehabilitation process may be walking indepen-\\ndently as soon as three months after the amputation.\\n• Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is usually administered\\nin addition to surgery, to kill cancer cells that have sep-arated from the original tumor and spread to other partsof the body. Although chemotherapy can increase thelikelihood of later development of another form of can-cer, the American Cancer Society maintains that theneed for chemotherapeutic bone-cancer treatment ismuch greater than the potential risk.\\n• Surgery. Surgery, coordinated with diagnostic biopsy,\\nenhances the probability that limb-salvage surgery canbe used to remove the cancer while preserving nearbyblood vessels and bones. A metal rod or bone graft isused to replace the area of bone removed, and subse-quent surgery may be needed to repair or replace rodsthat have loosened or broken. Patients who have under-gone limb-salvage surgery need intensive rehabilita-tion. It may take as long as a year for a patient to regainfull use of a leg following limb-salvage surgery, andpatients who have this operation may eventually have toundergo amputation.\\n•Radiation therapy . Radiation therapy is used often to\\ntreat Ewing’s sarcoma.• Rotationoplasty. Rotationoplasty, sometimes per-\\nformed after a leg amputation, involves attaching thelower leg and foot to the thigh bone, so that the anklereplaces the knee. A prosthetic is later added to makethe leg as long as it should be. Prosthetic devices arenot used to lengthen limbs that remain functional afteramputation to remove osteosarcomas located on theupper arm. When an osteosarcoma develops in the jawbone, the entire lower jaw is removed.

There isan estimated one million acres of wild saw palmettopalms in Florida, where the bulk of commercial saw pal-metto is grown.\\nPurpose\\nSaw palmetto is used by natural health practition-\\ners to treat a variety of ailments in men and women,such as testicular inflammation, urinary tract inflamma-tion, coughs, and respiratory congestion.

Most of the\\nevidence supporting these uses is anecdotal and has notbeen proven by controlled clinical trials. However,there is much scientific documentation outlining theeffectiveness of the herb in treating irritable bladderand urinary problems in men with benign prostatehyperplasia (BPH), an enlargement of the prostategland. BPH results in a swelling of the prostate glandthat obstructs the urethra. This causes painful urination,reduced urine flow, difficulty starting or stopping theflow, dribbling after urination, and more frequent night-time urination. Saw palmetto does not reduce prostateenlargement. Instead, it is thought to work in a varietyof ways. First, it inhibits the conversion of testosteroneinto dihydrotestosterone (DHT). BPH is thought to becaused by an increase in testosterone to DHT. Secondly,saw palmetto is believed to interfere with the produc-tion of estrogen and progesterone, hormones associatedwith DHT production.\\nIn addition to causing pain and embarrassment,\\nBPH can lead to serious kidney problems if undiagnosedand left untreated. It is a common problem in men overthe age of 40. Estimates are that 50-60% of all men willdevelop BPH in their lifetimes. It is estimated that thereare six million men between the ages of 50–79 who haveBPH serious enough to require some type of therapy. Yetonly half of them seek treatment from physicians.Health practitioners in both the allopathic and naturalmedicine communities recommend annual prostateexams for men over the age of 50, and an annual bloodtest that measures prostate specific antigen, a marker forprostate cancer .\\nRecently, a number of clinical trials have confirmed\\nthe effectiveness of saw palmetto in treating BPH. Manyof these trials have shown saw palmetto works betterthan the most commonly used prescription drug,Proscar. Saw palmetto is effective in nearly 90% ofpatients after six weeks of use, while Proscar is effectivein less than 50% of patients. In addition, Proscar maytake up to six months to achieve its full effect. SinceProscar blocks the production of testosterone, it cancause impotence and breast enlargement. Also, saw pal-\\nmetto is significantly less expensive than Proscar. A onemonth supply of saw palmetto costs $12–25, while a onemonth supply of Proscar costs $65–75. Other prescrip-tion drugs used to treat BPH are Cardura (doxazosin),Hytrin (terazosin), and Flomax (tamsulosin hydrochlo-ride). Originally prescribed to treat hypertension , Car-\\ndura and Hytrin can drop blood pressure, causing light-headedness and fainting . Presently, saw palmetto is\\nbeing evaluated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administra-tion (FDA) for treatment of BPH. If approved, it wouldbecome the first herbal product to be licensed by theagency as a treatment for a specific condition. Saw pal-\\nmetto is also used as a treatment for prostate complaintsand irritable bladder.\\nSince the 1960s, extensive clinical studies of saw\\npalmetto have been done in Europe. A 1998 review of 24European trials involved nearly 3,000 men, some takingsaw palmetto, others taking Proscar, and a third grouptaking a placebo. The men taking saw palmetto had a28% improvement in urinary tract symptoms, a 24%improvement in peak urine flow, and 43% improvementin overall urine flow. The results were nearly comparableto the group taking Proscar and superior to the men tak-ing a placebo.\\nUses in women\\nThere is very little documentation or scientific\\nresearch into saw palmetto use in women. However,several studies in the 1990s show that the BPH drugProscar can be effective in stopping unwanted facialand body hair growth, and in treating thinning hair inwomen. It works by blocking the action of an enzymecalled 5-alpha reductase. Anecdotal reports suggest thatsaw palmetto may be as effective as Proscar in treatingunwanted hair growth and thinning hair, and in prevent-ing some types of acne . It has also been used to treat\\nurinary tract inflammation and help relieve the symp-toms of menstruation. There are claims it can be used toenlarge breasts, but these claims have not been scientifi-cally tested.\\nHistory\\nSaw palmetto berries have been used in American\\nfolk medicine for several hundred years as an aphrodisi-ac and for treating prostate problems. Native Americansin the southeast United States have used saw palmettosince the 1700s to treat male urinary problems. In the1800s, medical botanist John Lloyd noted that animalsthat ate saw palmetto appeared healthier and fatter thanother livestock. Early American settlers noticed the sameeffects and used the juice from saw palmetto berries togain weight, to improve general disposition, as a seda-tive, and to promote reproductive health.\\nIn the United States, the medicinal uses of saw pal-\\nmetto were first documented in 1879 by Dr. J.B. Read,a physician in Savannah, Georgia, who published apaper on the medicinal benefits of the herb in the April1879 issue of American Journal of Pharmacy . He found\\nthe herb useful in treating a wide range of conditions.“By its peculiar soothing power on the mucous mem-brane it induces sleep, relieves the most troublesomecoughs, promotes expectoration, improves digestion,and increases fat, flesh and strength.

It was also usedin men to increase sperm production and sex drive,although these uses are discounted today. One of the firstpublished medical recommendations that saw palmettowas effective in treating prostate problems appeared inthe 1926 edition of United States Dispensatory . In the\\nlate 1920s, the use of medicinal plants, including sawpalmetto, began to decline in the United States, while atthe same time, it was on the rise in Europe.\\nPreparations\\nPeople taking saw palmetto should use only stan-\\ndardized extracts that contain 85–95% fatty acids andsterols. Dosages vary depending on the type of saw pal-metto used. A typical dose is 320 mg per day of standard-ized extract or 0.04–0.07 (1–2 g) per day of ground,dried, whole berries. It may take up to four weeks of usebefore beneficial effects are seen. In late 1999, the web-\\nbased independent consumer organization Consumer-Lab.com tested 27 leading brands of saw palmetto forfatty acid and sterol content. Ten of the brands containedless than the minimum recommended level of 85% fattyacids and sterols.\\nPrecautions\\nThere are no special precautions associated with tak-\\ning saw palmetto, even in high doses. However, BPH canbecome a serious problem if left untreated. Men who areexperiencing symptoms should be examined by a physi-cian, since the symptoms of BPH are similar to those ofprostate cancer . Men over the age of 50 should have a\\nyearly prostate exam. Saw palmetto should only be usedunder a doctor’s supervision by people with prostate can-cer,breast cancer , or any sex hormone related diseases.\\nAlthough the effects of saw palmetto on a fetus isunknown, pregnant women are advised not to take sawpalmetto.

Babies may have burrows on the soles of their\\nfeet, palms of their hands, and faces.\\nScratching seems to serve some purpose in scabies,\\nas the mites are apparently often inadvertently removed.Most infestations with scabies are caused by no morethan 15 mites altogether.\\nInfestation with huge numbers of mites (on the order\\nof thousands to millions) occurs when an individual doesnot scratch, or when an individual has a weakenedimmune system. These patients include those who live ininstitutions; are mentally retarded, or physically infirm;have other diseases which affect the amount of sensationthey have in their skin ( leprosy or syringomyelia); have\\nleukemia or diabetes; are taking medications whichlower their immune response ( cancer chemotherapy ,\\ndrugs given after organ transplantation); or have otherdiseases which lower their immune response (such asacquired immunodeficiency syndrome or AIDS ).

Infectedpatients have thickened, crusty areas all over their bod-ies, including over the scalp. Their skin is scaly. Theirfingernails may be thickened and horny.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis can be made simply by observing the\\ncharacteristic burrows of the mites causing scabies. Asterilized needle can be used to explore the pearly bumpat the end of a burrow, remove its contents, and place iton a slide to be examined. The mite itself may then be\\nidentified under a microscope.\\nOccasionally, a type of mite carried on dogs may\\ninfect humans.

This is usually sufficient, although it may be reap-plied after a week if mites remain. Preparations contain-ing lindane should not be used to treat pregnant womenand infants. Itching can be lessened by the use ofcalamine lotion and antihistamine medications.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for complete recovery from scabies\\ninfestation is excellent. In patients with weak immunesystems, the biggest danger is that the areas of skininvolved with scabies will become secondarily infectedwith bacteria.\\nPrevention\\nGood hygiene is essential in the prevention of sca-\\nbies.

The disease is characterizedby a sore throat , fever, and a sandpaper-like rash on red-\\ndened skin. It is primarily a childhood disease. If scarletfever is untreated, serious complications such asrheumatic fever (a heart disease) or kidney inflamma-\\ntion ( glomerulonephritis ) can develop.\\nDescription\\nScarlet fever, also known as scarlatina, gets its name\\nfrom the fact that the patient’s skin, especially on thecheeks, is flushed. A sore throat and raised rash overmuch of the body are accompanied by fever and slug-gishness (lethargy). The fever usually subsides within afew days and recovery is complete by two weeks. Afterthe fever is gone, the skin on the face and body flakes;the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feetpeels more dramatically.\\nThis disease primarily affects children ages two to\\nten. It is highly contagious and is spread by sneezing,coughing, or direct contact. The incubation period isthree to five days, with symptoms usually beginning onthe second day of the disease, and lasting from four toten days.Early in the 20th century, severe scarlet fever epi-\\ndemics were common. Today, the disease is rare.Although this decline is due in part to the availability ofantibiotics , that is not the entire reason since the decline\\nbegan before the widespread use of antibiotics. One theo-ry is that the strain of bacteria that causes scarlet feverhas become weaker with time.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nScarlet fever is caused by Group A streptococcal\\nbacteria ( S. pyogenes ). Group A streptococci can be\\nhighly toxic microbes that can cause strep throat ,\\nwound or skin infections, pneumonia , and serious kid-\\nney infections, as well as scarlet fever. The Group Astreptococci are ß-hemolytic bacteria, which means thatthe bacteria have the ability to lyse or break red bloodcells. The strain of streptococcus that causes scarlet feveris slightly different from the strain that causes most strepthroats.

Additionally,scarlet fever had many complications, some of whichwere severe and could be crippling. Gladys Dick, withher husband, George Dick, successfully isolated thebacteria which caused scarlet fever, developed a test forhuman vulnerability to the disease, and devised preven-tive methods. The couple patented their findings, specif-ically the way their scarlet fever toxin and antitoxinwere prepared, although this decision was controversialat the time.\\nIn 1923, the Dicks published papers in which they\\nproved that scarlet fever was caused by hemolyticstreptococcus. Within a few years, the Dicks also pub-lished papers on how to prevent, test, diagnose, andtreat scarlet fever. Their ground-breaking work ensuredthat the disease was finally understood and broughtunder control.\\nDick and her husband announced the development\\nof what came to be known as the Dick test in 1924. Thisskin test showed whether the patient was susceptible orimmune to scarlet fever. The test involved injecting atoxin-containing substance in the arm and determiningif the skin around the area became inflamed. If it did,the patient was vulnerable to scarlet fever. This test wasalso useful in predicting if pregnant women woulddevelop puerperal infection during childbirth.GEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 2951'),\n",

White spots appear on the tonsils. Lymphnodes under the jawline may swell and become tender.However, none of these symptoms are specific for strepthroat and may also occur with a viral infection. Othersigns are more characteristic of bacterial infections. Forexample, inflammation of the lymph nodes in the neckis typical in strep infections, but not viral infections. Onthe other hand, cough ,laryngitis , and stuffy nose tend\\nto be associated with viral infections rather than strepinfections. The main feature that distinguishes scarletfever from a mere strep throat is the presence of thesandpaper-red rash.\\nLaboratory tests are needed to make a definitive diag-\\nnosis of a strep infection and to distinguish a strep throatfrom a viral sore throat. One test that can be performed is ablood cell count. Bacterial infections are associated withan elevated white blood cell count. In viral infections, thewhite blood cell count is generally below normal.\\nA throat culture can distinguish between a strep\\ninfection and a viral infection. A throat swab from theinfected person is brushed over a nutrient gel (a sheepblood agar plate) and incubated overnight to detect the\\npresence of hemolytic bacteria. In a positive culture, aclear zone will appear in the gel surrounding the bacteri-um, indicating that a strep infection is present.\\nTreatment\\nAlthough scarlet fever will often clear up sponta-\\nneously within a few days, antibiotic treatment with eitheroral or injectable penicillin is usually recommended toreduce the severity of symptoms, prevent complications,and prevent spread to others.

The name bilharzi-asis comes from Theodor Bilharz, a German pathologist,who identified the worms in 1851.\\nDescription\\nInfections associated with worms present some of\\nthe most universal health problems in the world. In fact,only malaria accounts for more diseases than schistoso-\\nmiasis. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimatesthat 200 million people are infected and 120 million dis-play symptoms. Another 600 million people are at risk ofinfection. Schistosomes are prevalent in rural and outly-ing city areas of 74 countries in Africa, Asia, and LatinAmerica. In Central China and Egypt, the disease poses amajor health risk.\\nThere are five species of schistosomes that are\\nprevalent in different areas of the world and producesomewhat different symptoms:\\n•Schistosoma mansoni is widespread in Africa, the East-\\nern-Mediterranean, the Caribbean, and South Americaand can only infect humans and rodents.\\n•S. mekongi is prevalent only in the Mekong river basin\\nin Asia.\\n•S. japonicum is limited to China and the Philippines\\nand can infect other mammals, in addition to humans,such as pigs, dogs, and water buffalos. As a result, itcan be harder to control disease caused by this species.\\n•S. intercalatum is found in central Africa.\\n•S. haematobium occurs predominantly in Africa and the\\nEastern Mediterranean.\\nIntestinal schistosomiasis, caused by Schistosoma\\njaponicum, S. mekongi, mansoni , and S. intercalatum ,\\ncan lead to serious complications of the liver and spleen.Urinary schistosomiasis is caused by S. haematobium .\\nIt is difficult to know how many individuals die of\\nschistomiasis each year because death certificates and\\npatient records seldom identify schistosomiasis as theprimary cause of death. Mortality estimates vary relatedto the type of schistosome infection but is generally low,for example, 2.4 of 100,000 die each year from infectionwith S. mansoni .\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAll five species are contracted in the same way,\\nthrough direct contact with fresh water infested with thefree-living form of the parasite known as cercariae. Thebuilding of dams, irrigation systems, and reservoirs, andthe movements of refugee groups introduce and spreadschistosomiasis.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2953SchistosomiasisGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 2953'),\n",

The eggs break open to release a form of theparasite called miracidium. Freshwater snails becomeinfested with the miracidium, which multiply inside thesnail and mature into multiple cercariae that the snailejects into the water. The cercariae, which survive out-side a host for 48 hours, quickly penetrate unbroken skin,the lining of the mouth, or the gastrointestinal tract. Onceinside the human body, the worms penetrate the wall ofthe nearest vein and travel to the liver where they growand sexually mature. Mature male and female wormspair and migrate either to the intestines or the bladderwhere egg production occurs. One female worm may layan average of 200 to 2,000 eggs per day for up to twentyyears. Most eggs leave the blood stream and bodythrough the intestines. Some of the eggs are not excreted,however, and can lodge in the tissues. It is the presence\\nof these eggs, rather than the worms themselves, thatcauses the disease.\\nEarly symptoms of infection\\nMany individuals do not experience symptoms. If\\npresent, it usually takes four to six weeks for symptomsto appear. The first symptom of the disease may be a gen-eral ill feeling. Within twelve hours of infection, an indi-vidual may complain of a tingling sensation or light rash,commonly referred to as “swimmer’s itch,” due to irrita-tion at the point of entrance. The rash that may developcan mimic scabies and other types of rashes . Other\\nsymptoms can occur two to ten weeks later and caninclude fever, aching, cough ,diarrhea , or gland enlarge-\\nment. These symptoms can also be related to avian schis-tosomiasis which does not cause any further symptomsin humans.\\nKatayama fever\\nAnother primary condition, called Katayama fever,\\nmay also develop from infection with these worms, and itcan be very difficult to recognize. Symptoms includefever, lethargy, the eruption of pale temporary bumpsassociated with severe itching (urticarial) rash, liver and\\nspleen enlargement, and bronchospasm.\\nIntestinal schistosomiasis\\nIn intestinal schistosomiasis, eggs become lodged\\nin the intestinal wall and cause an immune system reac-tion called a granulomatous reaction. This immuneresponse can lead to obstruction of the colon and bloodloss. The infected individual may have what appears tobe a potbelly. Eggs can also become lodged in the liver,leading to high blood pressure through the liver,enlarged spleen, the build-up of fluid in the abdomen(ascites ), and potentially life-threatening dilations or\\nswollen areas in the esophagus or gastrointestinal tractthat can tear and bleed profusely (esophageal varices).Rarely, the central nervous system may be affected.Individuals with chronic active schistosomiasis may notcomplain of typical symptoms.\\nUrinary tract schistosomiasis\\nUrinary tract schistosomiasis is characterized by\\nblood in the urine, pain or difficulty urinating, and fre-\\nquent urination and are associated with S. haematobium .\\nThe loss of blood can lead to iron deficiency anemia .

The health-care provider should do a thorough history of travel inendemic areas. The rash, if present, can mimic scabies orother rashes, and the gastrointestinal symptoms may beconfused with those caused by bacterial illnesses or otherintestinal parasites. These other conditions will need tobe excluded before an accurate diagnosis can be made.As a result, clinical evidence of exposure to infectedwater along with physical findings, a negative test formalaria, and an increased number of one type of immunecell, called an eosinophil, are necessary to diagnose acuteschistosomiasis.\\nEggs may be detected in the feces or urine. Repeated\\nstool tests may be required to concentrate and identify theeggs. Blood tests may be used to detect a particular anti-gen or particle associated with the schistosome thatinduces an immune response. Persons infected with schis-tosomiasis may not test positive for six months, and as aresult, tests may need to be repeated to obtain an accuratediagnosis. Blood can be detected visually in the urine orwith chemical strips that react to small amounts of blood.\\nSophisticated imaging techniques, such as ultra-\\nsound, computed tomography scan (CT scan), and mag-\\nnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can detect damage to\\nthe blood vessels in the liver and visualize polyps andulcers of the urinary tract, for example, that occur in themore advanced stages. S. haematobium is difficult to\\ndiagnose with ultrasound in pregnant women.\\nTreatment\\nThe use of medications against schistosomiasis, such\\nas praziquantel (Biltricide), oxamniquine, and metrifonate,have been shown to be safe and effective. Praziquantel iseffective against all forms of schistososmiasis and has fewside effects. This drug is given in either two or three dosesover the course of a single day. Oxamniquine is typicallyused in Africa and South America to treat intestinal schis-tosomiasis. Metrifonate has been found to be safe andeffective in the treatment of urinary schistosomiasis.Patients are typically checked for the presence of livingeggs at three and six months after treatment. If the numberof eggs excreted has not significantly decreased, thepatient may require another course of medication.\\nPrognosis\\nIf treated early, prognosis is very good and complete\\nrecovery is expected.

These patients tended to functionwell before becoming psychotic; their psychotic symp-toms lasted relatively briefly; and they tended to do wellafterward. Over the years, however, the term schizoaffec-tive disorder has been applied to a variety of patientgroups. The current definition contained in the AmericanPsychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical\\nManual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV ) recognizes\\npatients with schizoaffective disorder as those whosemood symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant a diag-nosis of depression or other full-blown mood disorderand whose mood symptoms overlap at some period withpsychotic symptoms that satisfy the diagnosis of schizo-phrenia (e.g. hallucinations, delusions, or thoughtprocess disorder).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of schizoaffective disorder remains\\nunknown and subject to continuing speculation. Someinvestigators believe schizoaffective disorder is associatedwith schizophrenia and may be caused by a similar bio-logical predisposition. Others disagree, stressing the dis-order’s similarities to mood disorders such as depression\\nand bipolar disorder (manic depression). They believe itsmore favorable course and less intense psychotic episodesare evidence that schizoaffective disorder and mood dis-orders share a similar cause.\\nMany researchers, however, believe schizoaffective\\ndisorder may owe its existence to both disorders. Theseresearchers believe that some people have a biologic pre-disposition to symptoms of schizophrenia that variesalong a continuum of severity. On one end of the contin-uum are people who are predisposed to psychotic symp-toms but never display them. On the other end of the con-tinuum are people who are destined to develop outrightschizophrenia. In the middle are those who may at sometime show symptoms of schizophrenia, but require someother major trauma to set the progression of the diseaseinto motion. It may be an early brain injury—eitherthrough a complicated delivery, prenatal exposure to theflu virus or illicit drugs; or it may be emotional, nutri-tional or other deprivation in early childhood. In thisview, major life stresses, or a mood disorder like depres-sion or bipolar disorder, may be sufficient to trigger thepsychotic symptoms. In fact, patients with schizoaffec-tive disorder frequently experience depressed mood ormania within days of the appearance of psychotic symp-\\ntoms. Some clinicians believe that “schizomanic”patients are fundamentally different from “schizode-pressed” types; the former are similar to bipolar patients,while the latter are a very heterogeneous group.\\nSymptoms of schizoaffective disorder vary consider-\\nably from patient to patient. Delusions, hallucinations,and evidence of disturbances in thinking—as observed infull-blown schizophrenia—may be seen. Similarly, moodfluctuations such as those observed in major depressionor bipolar disorder may also be seen.

But between\\nepisodes, some patients with schizoaffective disorderremain chronically impaired while some may do quitewell in day-to-day living.\\nDiagnosis\\nThere are no accepted tissue or brain imaging tests\\nor techniques to diagnose schizophrenia, mood disorders,or schizoaffective disorder. Instead, physicians look forthe hallmark signs and symptoms of schizoaffective dis-order described above, and they attempt to rule out otherillnesses or conditions that may produce similar symp-toms. These include:\\n• Mania. True manic patients can experience episodes of\\nhallucinations and delusions similar to those seen inschizoaffective disorder; but these do not persist forlong periods after the mania recedes, as they do inschizoaffective disorder.\\n• Psychotic depression. Patients with psychotic depres-\\nsion experience hallucinations and delusions similar tothose seen in schizoaffective disorder; but these symp-toms do not persist after the depressive symptomsrecede, as they do in schizoaffective disorder.\\n• Schizophrenia. Depressed mood, mania, or other symp-\\ntoms may be present in patients with schizophrenia, butpatients with schizoaffective disorder will meet all thecriteria set out for a full-blown mood disorder.\\n• Medical and neurological disorders that mimic psy-\\nchotic/affective disorders.\\nTreatment\\nAntipsychotic medications used to treat schizophre-\\nnia and the antidepressant drugs and mood stabilizers\\nused in depression and bipolar disorder are the primarytreatments for schizoaffective disorder.\\nUnfortunately these treatments have not been well\\nstudied in controlled investigations. Studies suggest thattraditional antipsychotics such as haloperidol are effec-tive in treating psychotic symptoms. Newer generationantipsychotics, such as clozaril and risperidone, have notbeen as well studied, but also appear effective. Forpatients with symptoms of bipolar disorder, lithium isoften the mood stabilizer of choice; and it is often aug-mented with an anticonvulsant such as valproate. Forthose with depressive symptoms, the evidence support-ing the use of antidepressant medications in addition toantipsychotic medications is more mixed. Electrocon-\\nvulsive therapy (electric shock) is frequently tried in\\npatients who otherwise do not respond to antidepressantor mood stabilizing drugs.KEY TERMS\\nBipolar disorder —Also referred to as manic\\ndepression, it is a mood disorder marked by alter-nating episodes of extremely low mood (depres-sion) and exuberant highs (mania).\\nMood disorder —A collection of disorders that\\nincludes major depression and bipolar disorder.They are all characterized by major disruptions inpatients’ moods and emotions.\\nSchizophrenia —A major mental illness marked by\\npsychotic symptoms, including hallucinations,delusions, and severe disruptions in thinking.\\nWhile the mainstay of treatment for schizoaffec-\\ntive disorder is antipsychotic medications and moodstabilizers, certain forms of psychotherapy for bothpatients and family members can be useful. Therapydesigned to provide structure and help augmentpatients’ ability to solve problems may aid in improv-ing patients’ ability to function in the day-to-dayworld, reducing stress and the risk of recurrence. V oca-\\ntional and other rehabilitative training can help patientsto work on skills they need to develop. Whereas hospi-talization may be necessary for acute psychoticepisodes, half-way houses and day hospitals can pro-vide needed treatment while serving as a bridge forpatients to reenter the community.\\nAlternative treatment\\nWhile alternative therapies should never be con-\\nsidered a replacement for medication, these treatmentscan help support people with schizoaffectve disorderand other mental illnesses. Dietary modifications thateliminate processed foods and emphasize whole foods,along with nutritional supplementation, may be help-ful. Acupuncture ,homeopathy , and botanical medi-\\ncine can support many aspects of the person’s life andmay help decrease the side effects of any medicationsprescribed.\\nPrognosis\\nIn general, patients with schizoaffective disorder\\nhave a more favorable prognosis than do those withschizophrenia, but a less favorable course than those witha pure mood disorder.

Camer\\nSchizophrenia\\nDefinition\\nSchizophrenia is a psychotic disorder (or a group of\\ndisorders) marked by severely impaired thinking, emo-tions, and behaviors. Schizophrenic patients are typicallyunable to filter sensory stimuli and may have enhancedperceptions of sounds, colors, and other features of theirenvironment. Most schizophrenics, if untreated, gradual-ly withdraw from interactions with other people, and losetheir ability to take care of personal needs and grooming.\\nDescription\\nThe course of schizophrenia in adults can be divided\\ninto three phases or stages. In the acute phase, the patienthas an overt loss of contact with reality (psychoticepisode) that requires intervention and treatment. In thesecond or stabilization phase, the initial psychotic symp-toms have been brought under control but the patient is atrisk for relapse if treatment is interrupted. In the third ormaintenance phase, the patient is relatively stable and canbe kept indefinitely on antipsychotic medications. Even inthe maintenance phase, however, relapses are not unusualand patients do not always return to full functioning.\\nThe term schizophrenia comes from two Greek\\nwords that mean “split mind.” It was observed around1908, by a Swiss doctor named Eugen Bleuler, todescribe the splitting apart of mental functions that heregarded as the central characteristic of schizophrenia.\\nRecently, some psychotherapists have begun to use a\\nclassification of schizophrenia based on two main types.People with Type I, or positive schizophrenia, have arapid (acute) onset of symptoms and tend to respond wellto drugs. They also tend to suffer more from the “posi-tive” symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations .\\nPeople with Type II, or negative schizophrenia, are usual-ly described as poorly adjusted before their schizophre-nia slowly overtakes them. They have predominantly“negative” symptoms, such as withdrawal from othersand a slowing of mental and physical reactions (psy-chomotor retardation).\\nThere are five subtypes of schizophrenia:\\nParanoid\\nThe key feature of this subtype of schizophrenia is\\nthe combination of false beliefs (delusions) and hear-ing voices (auditory hallucinations), with more nearlynormal emotions and cognitive functioning (cognitivefunctions include reasoning, judgment, and memory).The delusions of paranoid schizophrenics usuallyinvolve thoughts of being persecuted or harmed byothers or exaggerated opinions of their own impor-tance, but may also reflect feelings of jealousy orexcessive religiosity. The delusions are typically orga-nized into a coherent framework. Paranoid schizo-phrenics function at a higher level than other subtypes,but are at risk for suicidal or violent behavior underthe influence of their delusions.\\nDisorganized\\nDisorganized schizophrenia (formerly called hebe-\\nphrenic schizophrenia) is marked by disorganizedspeech, thinking, and behavior on the patient’s part, cou-pled with flat or inappropriate emotional responses to asituation (affect). The patient may act silly or withdrawsocially to an extreme extent. Most patients in this cate-gory have weak personality structures prior to their ini-tial acute psychotic episode.\\nCatatonic\\nCatatonic schizophrenia is characterized by distur-\\nbances of movement that may include rigidity, stupor,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2958SchizophreniaGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 2958'),\n",

These patientsare at risk for malnutrition , exhaustion, or self-injury.\\nThis subtype is presently uncommon in Europe and theUnited States. Catatonia as a symptom is most com-\\nmonly associated with mood disorders .\\nUndifferentiated\\nPatients in this category have the characteristic posi-\\ntive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia but do notmeet the specific criteria for the paranoid, disorganized,or catatonic subtypes.\\nResidual\\nThis category is used for patients who have had at\\nleast one acute schizophrenic episode but do not present-ly have strong positive psychotic symptoms, such asdelusions and hallucinations. They may have negativesymptoms, such as withdrawal from others, or mildforms of positive symptoms, which indicate that the dis-order has not completely resolved.\\nThe risk of schizophrenia among first-degree bio-\\nlogical relatives is ten times greater than that observedin the general population. Furthermore the presence ofthe same disorder is higher in monozygotic twins (iden-tical twins) than in dizygotic twins (nonidentical twins).The research concerning adoption studies and identicaltwins also supports the notion that environmental factorsare important, because not all relatives who have the dis-order express it. There are several chromosomes and loci(specific areas on chromosomes which contain mutatedgenes), which have been identified. Research is activelyongoing to elucidate the causes, types and variations ofthese mutations.\\nA number of studies indicate that about 1% of the\\nworld’s population is affected by schizophrenia, withoutregard to race, social class, level of education, or culturalinfluences (outcome may vary from culture to culture,depending on the familial support of the patient). Mostpatients are diagnosed in their late teens or early twen-ties, but the symptoms of schizophrenia can emerge atany age in the life cycle. The male/female ratio in adultsis about 1.2:1. Male patients typically have their firstacute episode in their early twenties, while femalepatients are usually closer to age 30 when they are recog-nized with active symptoms.\\nSchizophrenia is rarely diagnosed in preadolescent\\nchildren, although patients as young as five or six havebeen reported. Childhood schizophrenia is at the upperend of the spectrum of severity and shows a greater gen-der disparity. It affects one or two children in every10,000; the male/female ratio is 2:1.Causes and symptoms\\nTheories of causality\\nOne of the reasons for the ongoing difficulty in clas-\\nsifying schizophrenic disorders is incomplete under-standing of their causes. As of 1998, it is thought thatthese disorders are the end result of a combination ofgenetic, neurobiological, and environmental causes. Aleading neurobiological hypothesis looks at the connec-tion between the disease and excessive levels ofdopamine, a chemical that transmits signals in the brain(neurotransmitter). The genetic factor in schizophreniahas been underscored by recent findings that first-degreebiological relatives of schizophrenics are ten times aslikely to develop the disorder as are members of the gen-eral population.\\nPrior to recent findings of abnormalities in the brain\\nstructure of schizophrenic patients, several generationsof psychotherapists advanced a number of psychoanalyt-ic and sociological theories about the origins of schizo-phrenia. These theories ranged from hypotheses aboutthe patient’s problems with anxiety or aggression to the-\\nories about stress reactions or interactions with disturbed\\nparents. Psychosocial factors are now thought to influ-ence the expression or severity of schizophrenia, ratherthan cause it directly.\\nAnother hypothesis suggests that schizophrenia may\\nbe caused by a virus that attacks the hippocampus, a partof the brain that processes sense perceptions. Damage tothe hippocampus would account for schizophrenicpatients’ vulnerability to sensory overload. As of mid-1998, researchers were preparing to test antiviral medica-tions on schizophrenics.\\nSymptoms of schizophrenia\\nPatients with a possible diagnosis of schizophrenia\\nare evaluated on the basis of a set or constellation ofsymptoms; there is no single symptom that is unique toschizophrenia. In 1959, the German psychiatrist KurtSchneider proposed a list of so-called first-rank symp-toms, which he regarded as diagnostic of the disorder.\\nThese symptoms include:\\n• delusions• somatic\\n• hallucinations\\n• hearing voices commenting on the patient’s behavior• thought insertion or thought withdrawal\\nSomatic hallucinations refer to sensations or percep-\\ntions concerning body organs that have no known med-ical cause or reason, such as the notion that one’s brain isradioactive.

The positive symptoms of\\nschizophrenia are those that represent an excessive ordistorted version of normal functions. Positive symp-toms include Schneider’s first-rank symptoms as well asdisorganized thought processes (reflected mainly inspeech) and disorganized or catatonic behavior. Disorga-nized thought processes are marked by such characteris-tics as looseness of associations, in which the patientrambles from topic to topic in a disconnected way; tan-gentially, which means that the patient gives unrelatedanswers to questions; and “word salad,” in which thepatient’s speech is so incoherent that it makes no gram-matical or linguistic sense. Disorganized behaviormeans that the patient has difficulty with any type ofpurposeful or goal-oriented behavior, including personalself-care or preparing meals. Other forms of disorga-nized behavior may include dressing in odd or inappro-priate ways, sexual self-stimulation in public, or agitatedshouting or cursing.\\nNEGATIVE SYMPTOMS. S chizophrenia includes three\\nso-called negative symptoms. They are called negativebecause they represent the lack or absence of behaviors.The negative symptoms that are considered diagnostic ofschizophrenia are a lack of emotional response (affectiveflattening), poverty of speech, and absence of volition orwill. In general, the negative symptoms are more difficultfor doctors to evaluate than the positive symptoms.\\nDiagnosis\\nA doctor must make a diagnosis of schizophrenia on\\nthe basis of a standardized list of outwardly observablesymptoms, not on the basis of internal psychologicalprocesses. There are no specific laboratory tests that canbe used to diagnose schizophrenia. Researchers have,however, discovered that patients with schizophrenia havecertain abnormalities in the structure and functioning ofthe brain compared to normal test subjects. These discov-eries have been made with the help of imaging techniquessuch as computed tomography scans (CT scans).\\nWhen a psychiatrist assesses a patient for schizo-\\nphrenia, he or she will begin by excluding physical con-ditions that can cause abnormal thinking and some otherbehaviors associated with schizophrenia. These condi-tions include organic brain disorders (including traumat-ic injuries of the brain) temporal lobe epilepsy, Wilson’sdisease, Huntington’s chorea, and encephalitis . The doc-\\ntor will also need to rule out substance abuse disorders,especially amphetamine use.After ruling out organic disorders, the clinician will\\nconsider other psychiatric conditions that may includepsychotic symptoms or symptoms resembling psychosis .\\nThese disorders include mood disorders with psychoticfeatures; delusional disorder; dissociative disorder nototherwise specified (DDNOS) or multiple personality\\ndisorder ; schizotypal, schizoid, or paranoid personality\\ndisorders ; and atypical reactive disorders. In the past,\\nmany individuals were incorrectly diagnosed as schizo-phrenic. Some patients who were diagnosed prior to thechanges in categorization should have their diagnoses,and treatment, reevaluated. In children, the doctor mustdistinguish between psychotic symptoms and a vivid fan-tasy life, and also identify learning problems or disor-ders. After other conditions have been ruled out, thepatient must meet a set of criteria specified:\\n•the patient must have two (or more) of the following\\nsymptoms during a one-month period: delusions; hallu-cinations; disorganized speech; disorganized or cata-tonic behavior; negative symptoms\\n• decline in social, interpersonal, or occupational func-\\ntioning, including self-care\\n•the disturbed behavior must last for at least six months\\n•mood disorders, substance abuse disorders, medical\\nconditions, and developmental disorders have beenruled out\\nTreatment\\nThe treatment of schizophrenia depends in part on\\nthe patient’s stage or phase. Patients in the acute phaseare hospitalized in most cases, to prevent harm to thepatient or others and to begin treatment with antipsychot-ic medications. A patient having a first psychotic episodeshould be given a CT or MRI ( magnetic resonance\\nimaging ) scan to rule out structural brain disease.\\nAntipsychotic medications\\nThe primary form of treatment of schizophrenia is\\nantipsychotic medication. Antipsychotic drugs help to\\ncontrol almost all the positive symptoms of the disorder.They have minimal effects on disorganized behavior andnegative symptoms. Between 60-70% of schizophrenicswill respond to antipsychotics. In the acute phase of theillness, patients are usually given medications by mouthor by intramuscular injection. After the patient has beenstabilized, the antipsychotic drug may be given in a long-acting form called a depot dose. Depot medications lastfor two to four weeks; they have the advantage of pro-tecting the patient against the consequences of forgettingor skipping daily doses. In addition, some patients whodo not respond to oral neuroleptics have better results\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2960SchizophreniaGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 2960'),\n",

(Antagonists block the action of someother substance; for example, dopamine antagonistscounteract the action of dopamine.) The exact mecha-nisms of action of these medications are not known, butit is thought that they lower the patient’s sensitivity tosensory stimuli and so indirectly improve the patient’sability to interact with others.\\nDOPAMINE RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST. The dopamine\\nantagonists include the older antipsychotic (also calledneuroleptic) drugs, such as haloperidol (Haldol), chlor-promazine (Thorazine), and fluphenazine (Prolixin).These drugs have two major drawbacks: it is often diffi-cult to find the best dosage level for the individualpatient, and a dosage level high enough to control psy-chotic symptoms frequently produces extrapyramidalside effects, or EPS. EPSs include parkinsonism, inwhich the patient cannot walk normally and usuallydevelops a tremor; dystonia, or painful muscle spasms ofthe head, tongue, or neck; and akathisia, or restlessness.A type of long-term EPS is called tardive dyskinesia ,\\nwhich features slow, rhythmic, automatic movements.Schizophrenics with AIDS are especially vulnerable to\\ndeveloping EPS.\\nSERATONIN DOPANINE ANTAGONISTS. The sero-\\ntonin dopamine antagonists, also called atypical antipsy-chotics, are newer medications that include clozapine(Clozaril), risperidone (Risperdal), and olanzapine(Zyprexa). The SDAs have a better effect on the negativesymptoms of schizophrenia than do the older drugs andare less likely to produce EPS than the older compounds.The newer drugs are significantly more expensive in theshort term, although the SDAs may reduce long-termcosts by reducing the need for hospitalization. They arealso presently unavailable in injectable forms. The SDAsare commonly used to treat patients who respond poorlyto the DAs. However, many psychotherapists now regardthe use of these atypical antipsychotics as the treatmentof first choice.\\nPsychotherapy\\nMost schizophrenics can benefit from psychothera-\\npy once their acute symptoms have been brought undercontrol by antipsychotic medication. Psychoanalyticapproaches are not recommended. Behavior therapy,however, is often helpful in assisting patients to acquireskills for daily living and social interaction. It can becombined with occupational therapy to prepare thepatient for eventual employment.Family therapy\\nFamily therapy is often recommended for the\\nfamilies of schizophrenic patients, to relieve the feel-ings of guilt that they often have as well as to helpthem understand the patient’s disorder. The family’sattitude and behaviors toward the patient are key fac-tors in minimizing relapses (for example, by reducingstress in the patient’s life), and family therapy canoften strengthen the family’s ability to cope with thestresses caused by the schizophrenic’s illness. Familytherapy focused on communication skills and problem-solving strategies is particularly helpful. In addition toformal treatment, many families benefit from supportgroups and similar mutual help organizations for rela-tives of schizophrenics.\\nPrognosis\\nOne important prognostic sign is the patient’s age\\nat onset of psychotic symptoms. Patients with earlyonset of schizophrenia are more often male, have alower level of functioning prior to onset, a higher rateof brain abnormalities, more noticeable negative symp-toms, and worse outcomes. Patients with later onset aremore likely to be female, with fewer brain abnormali-ties and thought impairment, and more hopeful prog-noses.\\nThe average course and outcome for schizophren-\\nics are less favorable than those for most other mentaldisorders, although as many as 30% of patients diag-nosed with schizophrenia recover completely and themajority experience some improvement. Two factorsthat influence outcomes are stressful life events and ahostile or emotionally intense family environment.Schizophrenics with a high number of stressfulchanges in their lives, or who have frequent contactswith critical or emotionally over-involved family mem-bers, are more likely to relapse.

This nerve runs from the lower part ofthe spinal cord, down the back of the leg, to the foot.Injury to or pressure on the sciatic nerve can cause thecharacteristic pain of sciatica: a sharp or burning painthat radiates from the lower back or hip, possibly follow-ing the path of the sciatic nerve to the foot.\\nDescription\\nThe sciatic nerve is the largest and longest nerve in\\nthe body. About the thickness of a person’s thumb, itspans from the lower back to the foot. The nerve origi-nates in the lower part of the spinal cord, the so-calledlumbar region. As it branches off from the spinal cord, itpasses between the bony vertebrae (the component bonesof the spine) and runs through the pelvic girdle, or hipbones. The nerve passes through the hip joint and contin-ues down the back of the leg to the foot.\\nSciatica is a fairly common disorder and approxi-\\nmately 40% of the population experiences it at somepoint in their lives. However, only about 1% have coex-isting sensory or motor deficits. Sciatic pain has severalroot causes and treatment may hinge upon the underlyingproblem.\\nOf the identifiable causes of sciatic pain, lum-\\nbosacral radiculopathy and back strain are the most fre-quently suspected. The term lumbosacral refers to thelower part of the spine, and radiculopathy describes aproblem with the spinal nerve roots that pass between thevertebrae and give rise to the sciatic nerve. This areabetween the vertebrae is cushioned with a disk of shock-absorbing tissue. If this disk shifts or is damaged throughinjury or disease, the spinal nerve root may be com-pressed by the shifted tissue or the vertebrae.\\nThis compression of the nerve roots sends a pain\\nsignal to the brain. Although the actual injury is to thenerve roots, the pain may be perceived as coming fromanywhere along the sciatic nerve.\\nThe sciatic nerve can be compressed in other ways.\\nBack strain may cause muscle spasms in the lower back,placing pressure on the sciatic nerve. In rare cases, infec-tion, cancer , bone inflammation, or other diseases may\\nbe causing the pressure. More likely, but often over-looked, is the piriformis syndrome. As the sciatic nervepasses through the hip joint, it shares the space with sev-eral muscles. One of these muscles, the piriformis mus-cle, is closely associated with the sciatic nerve. In somepeople, the nerve actually runs through the muscle. If thismuscle is injured or has a spasm, it places pressure on thesciatic nerve, in effect, compressing it.\\nIn many sciatica cases, the specific cause is never iden-\\ntified. About half of affected individuals recover from anepisode within a month. Some cases can linger a few weeks\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2963SciaticaGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 2963'),\n",

In some cases,\\nthe pain may return or potentially become chronic.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIndividuals with sciatica may experience some lower\\nback pain, but the most common symptom is pain thatradiates through one buttock and down the back of thatleg. The most identified cause of the pain is compressionor pressure on the sciatic nerve. The extent of the painvaries between individuals. Some people describe painthat centers in the area of the hip, and others perceive dis-comfort all the way to the foot. The quality of the painalso varies; it may be described as tingling, burning,prickly, aching, or stabbing.\\nOnset of sciatica can be sudden, but it can also\\ndevelop gradually. The pain may be intermittent or con-tinuous, and certain activities, such as bending, cough-ing, sneezing, or sitting, may make the pain worse.\\nChronic pain may arise from more than just com-\\npression on the nerve. According to some painresearchers, physical damage to a nerve is only half ofthe equation. A developing theory proposes that somenerve injuries result in a release of neurotransmitters andimmune system chemicals that enhance and sustain apain message. Even after the injury has healed, or thedamage has been repaired, the pain continues. Control ofthis abnormal type of pain is difficult.\\nDiagnosis\\nBefore treating sciatic pain, as much information as\\npossible is collected. The individual is asked to recountthe location and nature of the pain, how long it has con-tinued, and any accidents or unusual activities prior to itsonset. This information provides clues that may point toback strain or injury to a specific location. Back painfrom disk disease, piriformis syndrome, and back strainmust be differentiated from more serious conditions suchas cancer or infection. Lumbar stenosis, an overgrowth ofthe covering layers of the vertebrae that narrows thespinal canal, must also be considered. The possibilitythat a difference in leg lengths is causing the pain shouldbe evaluated; the problem can be easily be treated with afoot orthotic or built-up shoe.\\nOften, a straight-leg-raising test is done, in which\\nthe person lies face upward and the health care providerraises the affected leg to various heights. This test pin-points the location of the pain and may reveal whether itis caused by a disk problem. Other tests, such as havingthe individual rotate the hip joint, assess the hip muscles.Any pain caused by these movements may provide infor-mation about involvement of the piriformis muscle, andpiriformis weakness is tested with additional leg-strength\\nmaneuvers.\\nFurther tests may be done depending on the results\\nof the physical examination and initial pain treatment.\\nSuch tests might include magnetic resonance imaging\\n(MRI) and computed tomography scans (CT scans).\\nOther tests examine the conduction of electricity throughnerve tissues, and include studies of the electrical activitygenerated as muscles contract ( electromyography ),\\nnerve conduction velocity, and evoked potential testing.A more invasive test involves injecting a contrast sub-stance into the space between the vertebrae and makingx-ray images of the spinal cord ( myelography ), but this\\nprocedure is usually done only if surgery is being consid-ered. All of these tests can reveal problems with the ver-tebrae, the disk, or the nerve itself.\\nTreatment\\nInitial treatment for sciatica focuses on pain relief.\\nFor acute or very painful flare-ups, bed rest is advised forup to a week in conjunction with medication for the pain.Pain medication includes acetaminophen ,nonsteroidal\\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin ,o r\\nmuscle relaxants . If the pain is unremitting, opioids may\\nbe prescribed for short-term use or a local anesthetic willbe injected directly into the lower back. Massage andheat application may be suggested as adjuncts.\\nIf the pain is chronic, different pain relief medica-\\ntions are used to avoid long-term dosing of NSAIDs,muscle relaxants, and opioids. Antidepressant drugs ,\\nwhich have been shown to be effective in treating pain,may be prescribed alongside short-term use of musclerelaxants or NSAIDs. Local anesthetic injections orepidural steroids are used in selected cases.\\nAs the pain allows, physical therapy is introduced\\ninto the treatment regime. Stretching exercises that focuson the lower back, buttock, and hamstring muscles aresuggested. The exercises also include finding comfort-able, pain-reducing positions. Corsets and braces may beuseful in some cases, but evidence for their general effec-tiveness is lacking. However, they may be helpful to pre-vent exacerbations related to certain activities.\\nWith less pain and the success of early therapy, the\\nindividual is encouraged to follow a long-term programto maintain a healthy back and prevent re-injury. A phys-ical therapist may suggest exercises and regular activity,such as water exercise or walking. Patients are instructed\\nin proper body mechanics to minimize symptoms duringlight lifting or other activities.\\nIf the pain is chronic and conservative treatment fails,\\nsurgery to repair a herniated disk or cut out part or all of\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2964SciaticaGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 2964'),\n",

Symptomsmay also be relieved by icing the painful area as soon asthe pain occurs. Ice should be left on the area for 30-60minutes several times a day. After 2-3 days, a hot waterbottle or heating pad can replace the ice. Chiropractic or\\nosteopathy may offer possible solutions for relieving\\npressure on the sciatic nerve and the accompanying pain.Acupuncture and biofeedback may also be useful as pain\\ncontrol methods. Body work, such as the Alexander tech-\\nnique , can assist an individual in improving posture and\\npreventing further episodes of sciatic pain.\\nPrognosis\\nMost cases of sciatica are treatable with pain medica-\\ntion and physical therapy. After 4-6 weeks of treatment,an individual should be able to resume normal activities.\\nPrevention\\nSome sources of sciatica are not preventable, such as\\ndisk degeneration, back strain due to pregnancy , or acci-\\ndental falls. Other sources of back strain, such as poor pos-ture, overexertion, being overweight, or wearing highheels, can be corrected or avoided. Cigarette smoking may\\nalso predispose people to pain, and should be discontinued.\\nGeneral suggestions for avoiding sciatica, or pre-\\nventing a repeat episode, include sleeping on a firm mat-tress, using chairs with firm back support, and sittingwith both feet flat on the floor. Habitually crossing thelegs while sitting can place excess pressure on the sciaticnerve. Sitting a lot can also place pressure on the sciaticnerves, so it’s a good idea to take short breaks and movearound during the work day, long trips, or any other situ-ation that requires sitting for an extended length of time.If lifting is required, the back should be kept straight andthe legs should provide the lift. Regular exercise, such asswimming and walking, can strengthen back musclesand improve posture. Exercise can also help maintain ahealthy weight and lessen the likelihood of back strain.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nMaigne, Robert. “Sciatica.” In Diagnosis and Treatment of\\nPain of Vertebral Origin: A Manual Medicine Approach.Baltimore: Williams & Wilkins, 1996.\\nRydevik, Björn, Mitsuo Hasue, and Peter Wehling. “Etiology\\nof Sciatic Pain and Mechanisms of Nerve Root Compres-KEY TERMS\\nDisk—Dense tissue between the vertebrae that\\nacts as a shock absorber and prevents damage tonerves and blood vessels along the spine.\\nElectromyography —A medical test in which a\\nnerve’s ability to conduct an impulse is measured.\\nLumbosacral —Referring to the lower part of the\\nbackbone or spine.\\nMyelography —A medical test in which a special\\ndye is injected into a nerve to make it visible on anx ray.\\nPiriformis —A muscle in the pelvic girdle that is\\nclosely associated with the sciatic nerve.\\nRadiculopathy —A condition in which the spinal\\nnerve root of a nerve has been injured or dam-aged.\\nSpasm —Involuntary contraction of a muscle.\\nVertebrae —The component bones of the spine.\\nsion.” In The Lumbar Spine. 2nd ed.

The type known as localized scleroderma main-ly affects the skin. Systemic scleroderma, which is alsocalled systemic sclerosis, affects the smaller blood ves-sels and internal organs of the body.\\nDescription\\nScleroderma is an autoimmune disorder, which\\nmeans that the body’s immune system turns againstitself. In scleroderma, there is an overproduction ofabnormal collagen (a type of protein fiber present in con-nective tissue). This collagen accumulates throughout thebody, causing hardening (sclerosis), scarring (fibrosis),and other damage. The damage may affect the appear-ance of the skin, or it may involve only the internalorgans. The symptoms and severity of scleroderma varyfrom person to person.\\nScleroderma occurs in all races of people all over the\\nworld, but it affects about four females for every male.Among children, localized scleroderma is more com-mon, and systemic sclerosis is comparatively rare. Mostpatients with systemic sclerosis are diagnosed betweenages 30 and 50. In the United States, about 300,000 peo-ple have scleroderma. Young African-American womenand Native Americans of the Choctaw tribe have espe-cially high rates of the disease.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of scleroderma is still a puzzle. Although\\nthe accumulation of collagen appears to be a hallmark ofthe disease, researchers do not know why it occurs. Sometheories suggest that damage to blood vessels may causethe tissues of the body to receive an inadequate amount ofoxygen—a condition called ischemia . Some researchers\\nbelieve that the resulting damage causes the immune sys-tem to overreact, producing an autoimmune disorder.According to this theory of scleroderma, the immune sys-tem gears up to fight an invader, but no invader is actuallypresent. Cells in the immune system called antibodiesreact to the body’s own tissues as if they were foreign.The antibodies turn against the already damaged bloodvessels and the vessels’ supporting tissues. These immunecells are designed to deliver potent chemicals in order tokill foreign invaders. Some of these cells dump thesechemicals on the body’s own tissues instead, causinginflammation, swelling, damage, and scarring.\\nMost cases of scleroderma have no recognizable\\ntriggering event. Some cases, however, have been tracedto exposure to toxic (poisonous) substances. For exam-ple, coal miners and gold miners, who are exposed tohigh levels of silica dust, have above-average rates ofscleroderma. Other chemicals associated with the diseaseinclude polyvinyl chloride, benzine, toluene, and epoxy\\nresins. In 1981, 20,000 people in Spain were strickenwith a syndrome similar to scleroderma when their cook-ing oil was accidentally contaminated. Certain medica-tions, especially a drug used in cancer treatment called\\nbleomycin (Blenoxane), may lead to scleroderma. Someclaims of a scleroderma-like illness have been made bywomen with silicone breast implants , but a link has not\\nbeen proven in numerous studies.\\nSymptoms of systemic scleroderma\\nA condition called Raynaud’s phenomenon is the\\nfirst symptom in about 95% of all patients with systemicscleroderma. In Raynaud’s phenomenon, the blood ves-sels of the fingers and/or toes (the digits) react to cold inan abnormal way. The vessels clamp down, preventingblood flow to the tip of the digit. Eventually, the flow iscut off to the entire finger or toe. Over time, oxygendeprivation may result in open ulcers on the skin surface.These ulcers can lead to tissue death (gangrene ) and\\nloss of the digit. When Raynaud’s phenomenon is thefirst sign of scleroderma, the next symptoms usuallyappear within two years.\\nSKIN AND EXTREMITIES. Involvement of the skin\\nleads to swelling underneath the skin of the hands, feet,legs, arms, and face. Swelling is followed by thickeningand tightening of the skin, which becomes taut and shiny.Severe tightening may lead to abnormalities. For exam-ple, tightening of the skin on the hands may cause thefingers to become permanently curled (flexed). Struc-tures within the skin are damaged (including those pro-ducing hair, oil, and sweat), and the skin becomes dryand scaly. Ulcers may form, with the danger of infection.Calcium deposits often appear under the skin.\\nIn systemic scleroderma, the mouth and nose may\\nbecome smaller as the skin on the face tightens. Thesmall mouth may interfere with eating and dentalhygiene. Blood vessels under the skin may becomeenlarged and show through the skin, appearing as pur-plish marks or red spots. This chronic dilation of thesmall blood vessels is called telangiectasis.\\nMuscle weakness, joint pain and stiffness, and\\ncarpal tunnel syndrome are common in scleroderma.\\nCarpal tunnel syndrome involves scarring in the wrist,which puts pressure on the median nerve runningthrough that area. Pressure on the nerve causes numb-ness, tingling, and weakness in some of the fingers.\\nDIGESTIVE TRACT. The tube leading from the mouth\\nto the stomach (the esophagus) becomes stiff andscarred.

The\\nlungs are affected in about 66% of all people with sys-temic scleroderma. Complications include shortness of\\nbreath , coughing, difficulty breathing due to tightening\\nof the tissue around the chest, inflammation of the airsacs in the lungs (alveolitis), increased risk of pneumo-\\nnia, and an increased risk of cancer. For these reasons,\\nlung disease is the most likely cause of death associatedwith scleroderma.\\nThe lining around the heart (pericardium) may\\nbecome inflamed. The heart may have greater difficultypumping blood effectively ( heart failure ). Irregular\\nheart rhythms and enlargement of the heart also occur inscleroderma.\\nKidney disease is another common complication.\\nDamage to blood vessels in the kidneys often causes amajor rise in the person’s blood pressure. The bloodpressure may be so high that there is swelling of thebrain, causing severe headaches, damage to the retinas ofthe eyes, seizures, and failure of the heart to pump bloodinto the body’s circulatory system. The kidneys may alsostop filtering blood and go into failure. Treatments forhigh blood pressure have greatly improved these kidneycomplications. Before these treatments were available,kidney problems were the most common cause of deathfor people with scleroderma.\\nOther problems associated with scleroderma include\\npainful dryness of the eyes and mouth, enlargement anddestruction of the liver, and a low-functioning thyroidgland.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of scleroderma is complicated by the fact\\nthat some of its symptoms can accompany other connec-tive-tissue diseases. The most important symptom isthickened or hardened skin on the fingers, hands, fore-arms, or face. This is found in 98% of people with sclero-derma. It can be detected in the course of a physical\\nexamination . The person’s medical history may also\\ncontain important clues, such as exposure to toxic sub-stances on the job. There are a number of nonspecificlaboratory tests on blood samples that may indicate thepresence of an inflammatory disorder (but not specifical-ly scleroderma). The antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is\\npositive in more than 95% of people with scleroderma.\\nOther tests can be performed to evaluate the extent\\nof the disease. These include a test of the electrical sys-tem of the heart (an electrocardiogram), lung-functiontests, and x-ray studies of the gastrointestinal tract. Vari-ous blood tests can be given to study kidney function.\\nTreatment\\nAt this time there is no cure for scleroderma. A drug\\ncalled D-penicillamine has been used to interfere with theabnormal collagen. It is believed to help decrease thedegree of skin thickening and tightening, and to slow theprogress of the disease in other organs. Taking vitamin Dand using ultraviolet light may be helpful in treating local-ized scleroderma. Corticosteroids have been used to treat\\njoint pain, muscle cramps, and other symptoms of inflam-mation. Other drugs have been studied that reduce theactivity of the immune system (immunosuppressants).Because these medications can have serious side effects,they are used in only the most severe cases of scleroderma.\\nThe various complications of scleroderma are treat-\\ned individually. Raynaud’s phenomenon requires thatpeople try to keep their hands and feet warm constantly.Nifedipine is a medication that is sometimes given tohelp control Raynaud’s. Thick ointments and creams areused to treat dry skin. Exercise and massage may help\\njoint involvement; they may also help people retain moremovement despite skin tightening.

Frey, PhD\\nSclerotherapy for esophageal\\nvarices\\nDefinition\\nSclerotherapy for esophageal varices (also called\\nendoscopic sclerotherapy) is a treatment for esophagealbleeding that involves the use of an endoscope and theinjection of a sclerosing solution into veins.\\nPurpose\\nIn most hospitals, sclerotherapy for esophageal\\nvarices is the treatment of choice to stop esophagealbleeding during acute episodes, and to prevent furtherincidences of bleeding. Emergency sclerotherapy is oftenfollowed by preventive treatments to eradicate distendedesophageal veins.\\nPrecautions\\nSclerotherapy for esophageal varices cannot be per-\\nformed on an uncooperative patient, since movement dur-ing the procedure could cause the vein to tear or the esoph-agus to perforate and bleed. It should not be performed ona patient with a perforated gastrointestinal tract.\\nDescription\\nEsophageal varices are enlarged or swollen veins on\\nthe lining of the esophagus which are prone to bleeding.They are life-threatening, and can be fatal in up to 50%of patients. They usually appear in patients with severeliver disease. Sclerotherapy for esophageal varicesinvolves injecting a strong and irritating solution (a scle-rosant) into the veins and/or the area beside the distendedvein. The sclerosant injected into the vein causes bloodclots to form and stops the bleeding. The sclerosantinjected into the area beside the distended vein stops thebleeding by thickening and swelling the vein to compressthe blood vessel. Most physicians inject the sclerosantdirectly into the vein, although injections into the veinand the surrounding area are both effective. Once bleed-ing has been stopped, the treatment can be used to signif-icantly reduce or destroy the varices.\\nSclerotherapy for esophageal varices is performed by\\na physician in a hospital, with the patient awake but sedat-ed. Hyoscine butylbromide (Buscopan) may be adminis-tered to freeze the esophagus, making injection of thesclerosant easier. During the procedure, an endoscope ispassed through the patient’s mouth to the esophagus toview the inside. The branches of the blood vessels at orjust above where the stomach and esophagus cometogether, the usual site of variceal bleeding, are located.After the bleeding vein is identified, a long, flexible scle-rotherapy needle is passed through the endoscope. Whenthe tip of the needle’s sheath is in place, the needle isadvanced, and the sclerosant is injected into the vein orthe surrounding area. The most commonly used scle-rosants are ethanolamine and sodium tetradecyl sulfate.The needle is withdrawn. The procedure is repeated asmany times as necessary to eradicate all distended veins.\\nSclerotherapy for esophageal varices controls acute\\nbleeding in about 90% of patients, but it may have to berepeated within the first 48 hours to achieve this successrate. During the initial hospitalization, sclerotherapy is usu-ally performed two or three times. Preventive treatmentsare scheduled every few weeks or so, depending on thepatient’s risk level and healing rate. Several studies haveshown that the risk of recurrent bleeding is much lower inpatients treated with sclerotherapy: 30-50%, as opposed to70-80% for patients not treated with sclerotherapy.\\nPreparation\\nBefore sclerotherapy for esophageal varices, the\\npatient’s vital signs and other pertinent data are recorded,an intravenous line is inserted to administer fluid orblood, and a sedative is prescribed.\\nAftercare\\nAfter sclerotherapy for esophageal varices, the\\npatient will be observed for signs of blood loss, lungcomplications, fever , a perforated esophagus, or other\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2969Sclerotherapy for esophageal varicesGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 2969'),\n",

Pain medication is usually pre-\\nscribed. After leaving the hospital, the patient follows adiet prescribed by the physician, and, if appropriate, cantake mild pain relievers.\\nRisks\\nSclerotherapy for esophageal varices has a 20-40%\\nincidence of complications, and a 1–2% mortality rate.Complications can arise from the sclerosant or the endo-scopic procedure. Minor complications, which areuncomfortable but do not require active treatment or pro-longed hospitalization, include transient chest pain, diffi-culty swallowing, and fever, which usually go away aftera few days. Some people have allergic reactions to thesolution. Infection occurs in up to 50% of cases. In 2-10%of patients, the esophagus tightens, but this can usually betreated with dilatation. More serious complications mayoccur in 10-15% of patients treated with sclerotherapy.These include perforation or bleeding of the esophagusand lung problems, such as aspiration pneumonia . Long-\\nterm sclerotherapy can damage the esophagus, andincrease the patient’s risk of developing cancer .\\nPatients with advanced liver disease complicated by\\nbleeding are very poor risks for this procedure. Thesurgery, premedications, and anesthesia may be sufficientto tip the patient into protein intoxication and hepaticcoma . The blood in the bowels acts like a high protein\\nmeal; therefore, protein intoxication may be induced.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nGreen, Frederick L., and Jeffrey L.

Scoliosis is a lateral (side-to-side) curve in the spine, usually combined with a rotationof the vertebrae. (The lateral curvature of scoliosisshould not be confused with the normal set of front-to-back spinal curves visible from the side.) While a smalldegree of lateral curvature does not cause any medicalproblems, larger curves can cause postural imbalanceand lead to muscle fatigue and pain . More severe scolio-\\nsis can interfere with breathing and lead to arthritis of thespine (spondylosis).\\nApproximately 10% of all adolescents have some\\ndegree of scoliosis, though fewer than 1% have curveswhich require medical attention beyond monitoring. Sco-liosis is found in both boys and girls, but a girl’s spinalcurve is much more likely to progress than a boy’s. Girlsrequire scoliosis treatment about five times as often. Thereason for these differences is not known.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nFour out of five cases of scoliosis are idiopathic ,\\nmeaning the cause is unknown. While idiopathic scolio-sis tends to run in families, no responsible genes hadbeen identified as of 1997.

Scoliosis is\\nnot caused by poor posture, diet, or carrying a heavybookbag exclusively on one shoulder.\\nIdiopathic scoliosis is further classified according to\\nage of onset:\\n• Infantile. Curvature appears before age three. This type\\nis quite rare in the United States, but is more commonin Europe.\\n• Juvenile. Curvature appears between ages 3 and 10.\\nThis type may be equivalent to the adolescent type,except for the age of onset.\\n• Adolescent. Curvature appears between ages of 10 and\\n13, near the beginning of puberty . This is the most\\ncommon type of idiopathic scoliosis.\\n• Adult. Curvature begins after physical maturation is\\ncompleted.\\nCauses are known for three other types of scoliosis:\\n• Congenital scoliosis is due to congenital abnormal for-\\nmation of the bones of the spine, and is often associatedwith other organ defects.\\n• Neuromuscular scoliosis is due to loss of control of the\\nnerves or muscles which support the spine. The mostcommon causes of this type of scoliosis are cerebral\\npalsy and muscular dystrophy .\\n• Degenerative scoliosis may be caused by degeneration\\nof the discs which separate the vertebrae or arthritis inthe joints that link them.\\nScoliosis causes a noticeable asymmetry in the torso\\nwhen viewed from the front or back. The first sign ofscoliosis is often seen when a child is wearing a bathingsuit or underwear. A child may appear to be standingwith one shoulder higher than the other, or to have a tiltin the waistline. One shoulder blade may appear moreprominent than the other due to rotation. In girls, onebreast may appear higher than the other, or larger if rota-tion pushes that side forward.\\nCurve progression is greatest near the adolescent\\ngrowth spurt. Scoliosis that begins early on is more likelyto progress significantly than scoliosis that begins later inpuberty.\\nMore than 30 states have screening programs in\\nschools for adolescent scoliosis, usually conducted bytrained school nurses or gym teachers.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis for scoliosis is done by an orthopedist. A\\ncomplete medical history is taken, including questionsabout family history of scoliosis. The physical examina-\\ntion includes determination of pubertal development inadolescents, a neurological exam (which may reveal a\\nneuromuscular cause), and measurements of trunk asym-metry. Examination of the trunk is done while the patientis standing, bending over, and lying down, and involvesboth visual inspection and use of a simple mechanicaldevice called a scoliometer.\\nIf a curve is detected, one or more x rays will usual-\\nly be taken to define the curve or curves more precisely.An x ray is used to document spinal maturity, any pelvictilt or hip asymmetry, and the location, extent, anddegree of curvature. The curve is defined in terms ofwhere it begins and ends, in which direction it bends,and by an angle measure known as the Cobb angle. TheCobb angle is found by projecting lines parallel to thevertebrae tops at the extremes of the curve; projectingperpendiculars from these lines; and measuring theangle of intersection. To properly track the progress ofscoliosis, it is important to project from the same pointsof the spine each time.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2971Scoliosis\\nThis woman suffers from scoliosis, or curvature of the spine.\\n(Custom Medical Stock Photo.

Watchful waiting is usually all that is requiredin adolescents with curves of 20–30 degrees, or adultswith curves up to 40 degrees or slightly more, as long asthere is no pain.\\nFor children or adolescents whose curves progress to\\n30 degrees, and who have a year or more of growth left,bracing may be required. Bracing cannot correct curva-ture, but may be effective in halting or slowing progres-sion. Bracing is rarely used in adults, except where painis significant and surgery is not an option, as in someelderly patients.\\nTwo general styles of braces are used for daytime\\nwear. The Milwaukee brace consists of metal uprightsattached to pads at the hips, rib cage, and neck. The under-arm brace uses rigid plastic to encircle the lower rib cage,abdomen, and hips. Both these brace types hold the spinein a vertical position. Because it can be worn out of sightbeneath clothing, the underarm brace is better tolerated andoften leads to better compliance. A third style, theCharleston bending brace, is used at night to bend the spinein the opposite direction. Braces are often prescribed to beworn for 22–23 hours per day, though some cliniciansallow or encourage removal of the brace for exercise .\\nBracing may be appropriate for scoliosis due to\\nsome types of neuromuscular disease, including spinalmuscular atrophy, before growth is finished. Duchennemuscular dystrophy is not treated by bracing, sincesurgery is likely to be required, and since later surgery iscomplicated by loss of respiratory capacity.\\nSurgery for idiopathic scoliosis is usually recom-\\nmended if:\\n• the curve has progressed despite bracing\\n• the curve is greater than 40-50 degrees before growth\\nhas stopped in an adolescent\\n• the curve is greater than 50 degrees and continues to\\nincrease in an adult\\n• there is significant painOrthopedic surgery for neuromuscular scoliosis is\\noften done earlier. The goals of surgery are to correct thedeformity as much as possible, to prevent further deformity,and to eliminate pain as much as possible. Surgery can usu-ally correct 40–50% of the curve, and sometimes as muchas 80%. Surgery cannot always completely remove pain.\\nThe surgical procedure for scoliosis is called spinal\\nfusion , because the goal is to straighten the spine as\\nmuch as possible, and then to fuse the vertebrae togetherto prevent further curvature. To achieve fusion, theinvolved vertebra are first exposed, and then scraped topromote regrowth. Bone chips are usually used to splinttogether the vertebrae to increase the likelihood offusion. To maintain the proper spinal posture beforefusion occurs, metal rods are inserted alongside thespine, and are attached to the vertebrae by hooks, screws,or wires. Fusion of the spine makes it rigid and resistantto further curvature. The metal rods are no longer neededonce fusion is complete, but are rarely removed unlesstheir presence leads to complications.\\nSpinal fusion leaves the involved portion of the\\nspine permanently stiff and inflexible. While this leads tosome loss of normal motion, most functional activitiesare not strongly affected, unless the very lowest portionof the spine (the lumbar region) is fused. Normal mobili-ty, exercise, and even contact sports are usually all possi-ble after spinal fusion. Full recovery takes approximatelysix months.\\nAlternative treatment\\nNumerous alternative therapies have been touted to\\nprovide relief and help for individuals with scoliosis, butnone have been proven beneficial in clinical trials. Theseinclude massage, physical therapy, and electrical stimu-lation. In addition, alternatives such as physical therapy,rolfing , or chiropractice manipulation may provide\\nimproved flexibility, stronger muscles, and pain relief,but cannot prevent or correct the curvature of the spine orits natural progression.\\nAlthough important for general health and strength,\\nexercise has not been shown to prevent or slow the devel-opment of scoliosis. It may help relieve pain from scolio-sis by helping to maintain range of motion. Aquatic exer-cise, in particular, can increase flexibility and improveposture, balance, coordination, and range of motion.Because it decreases joint compression, it can lessen thepain caused by scoliosis or surgery.\\nGood nutrition is also important for general health,\\nbut no specific dietary regimen has been shown to con-trol scoliosis development. In particular, dietary calciumlevels do not influence scoliosis progression.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2972ScoliosisGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 2972'),\n",

Acupuncture and acupressure may also help reduce\\npain and discomfort, but they cannot halt scoliosis devel-opment either.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for a person with scoliosis depends on\\nmany factors, including the age at which scoliosis beginsand the treatment received. More importantly, mostlyunknown individual factors affect the likelihood of pro-gression and the severity of the curve. Most cases of mildadolescent idiopathic scoliosis need no treatment and donot progress. Untreated severe scoliosis often leads tospondylosis, and may impair breathing.

Infection is called epididymitis because it mostly\\ninvolves a collection of tubules on top of the testicle calledthe epididymis. Twisting of the testis shuts off its bloodsupply and is called testicular torsion . Both conditions\\ncause a very painful, swollen testis on one side. Both occurmost often in young men, although infection usuallyoccurs at a slightly greater age. The infection increases theblood supply, and the torsion cuts off the blood supply.This is an ideal situation for a blood flow study.\\nThe distinction is critically important, because tes-\\nticular torsion must be untwisted immediately or thetestis will die. On the other hand, epididymitis respondsto antibiotics , and surgery might further injure it.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2973Scrotal nuclear medicine scanGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 2973'),\n",

The sound waves are reflected by scrotal tissue toform a picture of internal structures. It is not invasive andinvolves no radiation.\\nPurpose\\nUltrasound of the scrotum is the primary imaging\\nmethod used to evaluate disorders of the testicles andsurrounding tissues. It is used when a patient has acutepain in the scrotum. Some of the problems for which the\\nuse of scrotal ultrasound is valuable include an absent orundescended testicle, an inflammation problem, testicu-\\nlar torsion , a fluid collection, abnormal blood vessels, or\\na mass (lump or tumor).\\nA sudden onset of pain in the scrotum is considered\\na serious problem, as delay in diagnosis and treatmentcan lead to loss of function. Epididymitis is the most\\ncommon cause of this type of pain. Epididymitis is aninflammation of the epididymis, a tubular structure thattransports sperm from the testes. It is most often causedby bacterial infection, but may occur after injury, or arisefrom an unknown cause. Epididymitis is treatable withantibiotics , which usually resolves pain quickly. Left\\nuntreated, this condition can lead to abscess formation or\\nloss of blood supply to the testicle.\\nTesticular torsion is the twisting of the spermatic\\ncord that contains the blood vessels which supply the tes-ticles. It is caused by abnormally loose attachments oftissues that are formed during fetal development. Torsioncan be complete, incomplete, or intermittent. Sponta-neous detorsion, or untwisting, can occur, making diag-nosis difficult. Testicular torsion arises most commonlyduring adolescence, and is acutely painful. Scrotal ultra-sound is used to distinguish this condition from inflam-matory problems, such as epididymitis. Testicular torsionis a surgical emergency; it should be operated on as soonas possible to avoid permanent damage to the testes.\\nA scrotal sac with an absent testicle may be the result\\nof a congenital anomaly (an abnormality present at birth),where a testicle fails to develop. More often, it is due toan undescended testicle.

The main symp-toms of the disease are fever , a wound at the site of the\\nbite, a spotted rash on the trunk, and swelling of thelymph glands.\\nDescription\\nScrub typhus is caused by Rickettsia tsutsugamushi ,\\na tiny parasite about the size of bacteria that belongs tothe family Rickettsiaceae. Under the microscope, rick-ettsiae are either rod-like (bacilli) or spherical (cocci) inshape. Because they are intracellular parasites, they canlive only within the cells of other animals.\\nR. tsutsugamushi lives primarily in mites that belong\\nto the species Leptotrombidium (Trombicula) akamushi\\nand Leptotrombidium deliense . In Japan, some cases of\\nscrub typhus have been reportedly transmitted by mites ofthe species Leptotrombidium scutellare and Leptotrombid-\\nium pallidum . The mites have four-stage life cycles: egg,\\nlarva, nymph, and adult. The larva is the only stage thatcan transmit the disease to humans and other vertebrates.\\nThe tiny chiggers (mite larvae) attach themselves to\\nthe skin. During the process of obtaining a meal, they mayeither acquire the infection from the host or transmit therickettsiae to other mammals or humans. In regions wherescrub typhus is a constant threat, a natural cycle of R. tsut-\\nsugamushi transmission occurs between mite larvae and\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2975Scrub typhusGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 2975'),\n",

Humans enter a\\ncycle of rickettsial infection only accidentally.\\nScrub typhus is also known as tsutsugamushi dis-\\nease. The name tsutsugamushi is derived from two\\nJapanese words: tsutsuga, meaning something small anddangerous, and mushi, meaning creature. The infection iscalled scrub typhus because it generally occurs afterexposure to areas with secondary (scrub) vegetation. Ithas recently been found, however, that the disease canalso be prevalent in such areas as sandy beaches, moun-tain deserts, and equatorial rain forests. Therefore, it hasbeen suggested that the names mite-borne typhus, orchigger-borne typhus, are more appropriate. Since thedisease is limited to eastern and southeastern Asia, India,northern Australia and the adjacent islands, it is alsocommonly referred to as tropical typhus.\\nThe seasonal occurrence of scrub typhus varies with\\nthe climate in different countries. It occurs more fre-quently during the rainy season. Certain areas such asforest clearings, riverbanks, and grassy regions provideoptimal conditions for the infected mites to thrive. Thesesmall geographic regions are high-risk areas for humansand have been called scrub-typhus islands.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe incubation period of scrub typhus is about 10 to\\n12 days after the initial bite. The illness begins rathersuddenly with shaking chills, fever, severe headache ,\\ninfection of the mucous membrane lining the eyes (theconjunctiva), and swelling of the lymph nodes (lym-phadenopathy). A wound (lesion) is often seen at the siteof the chigger bite. Bite wounds are common in whites\\nbut rare in Asians.\\nThe initial lesion, which is about 0.4 in (1 cm) in\\ndiameter and flat, eventually becomes elevated and filledwith fluid. After it ruptures, it becomes covered with ablack scab (eschar). The patient’s fever rises during the firstweek, generally reaching 40–40.5°C (104–105°F). Aboutthe fifth day of fever, a red spotted rash develops on thetrunk, often extending to the arms and legs. It may eitherfade away in a few days or may become spotted and elevat-ed (maculopapular) and brightly colored. Cough is present\\nduring the first week of the fever. An infection of the lung(pneumonitis) may develop during the second week.\\nIn severe cases, the patient’s pulse rate increases and\\nblood pressure drops. The patient may become deliriousand lose consciousness. Muscular twitching may devel-op. Enlargement of the spleen is observed. Inflammationof the heart muscle (interstitial myocarditis ) is more\\ncommon in scrub typhus than in other rickettsial dis-eases. In untreated patients, high fever may last for morethan two weeks. With specific therapy, however, the fever\\nbreaks within 36 hours. The patient’s recovery is promptand uneventful.\\nDiagnosis\\nPatient history and physical examination\\nDifferentiating scrub typhus from other forms of\\ntyphus as well as from fever, typhoid and meningococcalinfections is often difficult during the first several daysbefore the initial rash appears. The geographical locationof scrub typhus, the initial sore caused by the chigger bite,and the occurrence of specific proteins capable ofdestroying the organism (antibodies) in the blood, providehelpful clues and are useful in establishing the diagnosis.\\nLaboratory tests\\nDiagnostic procedures involving the actual isolation\\nof rickettsiae from the blood or other body tissues areusually expensive, time-consuming, and hazardous tolaboratory workers. As a result, several types of testsknown as serological (immunological) tests are usedwidely to confirm the clinical diagnosis in the laboratory.\\nSpecific antibodies develop in the body in response to\\nan infection. The development of antibodies during therecovery period indicates that an immune response is pre-sent. The formation of antibodies is the basic principle of aserological test. Three different tests are available to diag-nose rickettsial infections. The most widely used is theWeil-Felix test. This test is based on the fact that some ofthe antibodies that are formed in the body during a rick-ettsial infection can react with certain strains (OX-2 andOX-19) of Proteus bacteria and cause them to clump\\n(agglutinate). The clumping is easily seen under themicroscope. The Weil-Felix test is easy and inexpensive toperform, with the result that it is widely used. The Weil-Felix test, however, is not very specific. In addition, theclumping is not detectable until the second week of the ill-ness, which limits the test’s usefulness in early diagnosis.\\nA second test known as a complement fixation (CF)\\ntest is based on the principle that if antibodies are formedin the body in response to the illness, then the antigenand the antibody will form complexes. These antigen-antibody complexes have the ability to inactivate, or fix,a protein that is found in blood serum (serum comple-ment). The serum complement fixation can be measuredusing standardized biochemical tests and confirms thepresence of antibodies. A third test known as the fluores-cent antibody test uses fluorescent tags that are attachedto antibodies for easy detection. This test has been devel-oped using three strains of Rickettsia tsutsugamushi and\\nhas proven to be the most specific for diagnosis.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2976Scrub typhusGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 2976'),\n",

The\\nbody’s need for vitamin C increases when a person isunder stress ,smoking , or taking certain medications.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA lack of vitamin C in the diet is the primary cause\\nof scurvy. This can occur in people on very restricteddiets , who are under extreme physiological stress (for\\nexample, during an infection or after an injury), and inchronic alcoholics. Infants can develop scurvy if they areweaned from breast milk and switched to cow’s milkwithout an additional supplement of vitamin C. Babies ofmothers who took extremely high doses of vitamin Cduring pregnancy can develop infantile scurvy. In chil-dren, the deficiency can cause painful swelling of thelegs along with fever ,diarrhea , and vomiting. In adults,\\nearly signs of scurvy include feeling weak, tired, andachy. The appearance of tiny red blood-blisters to largerpurplish blotches on the skin of the legs is a common\\nsymptom. Wound healing may be delayed and scars thathad healed may start to breakdown. The gums swell andbleed easily, eventually leading to loosened teeth. Muscleand joint pain may also occur.\\nDiagnosis\\nScurvy is often diagnosed based on the symptoms\\npresent.

Melatonin is thought toplay an active role in regulating the “internal body clock,”which dictates when humans feel like going to bed at nightand getting up in the morning. Although seasonal affectivedisorder is most common when light is low, it may occurin the spring, and it is then often called reverse SAD.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe body produces more melatonin at night than\\nduring the day, and scientists believe it helps people feelsleepy at nighttime. There is also more melatonin in thebody during winter, when the days are shorter. Someresearchers believe that excessive melatonin release dur-ing winter in people with SAD may account for theirfeelings of drowsiness or depression. One variation onthis idea is that, during winter, people’s internal clocksmay become out of sync with the light-dark cycle, lead-ing to a long-term disruption in melatonin release.Seasonal affective disorder, while not an official cate-\\ngory of mental illness listed by the American PsychiatricAssociation, is estimated to affect 10 million Americans,most of whom are women. Another 25 million Americansmay have a mild form of SAD, sometimes called the“winter blues” or “winter blahs.” The risk of SADincreases the further from the equator a person lives.\\nThe symptoms of SAD are similar to those of other\\nforms of depression. People with SAD may feel sad, irri-table, or tired, and may find themselves sleeping toomuch. They may also lose interest in normal or pleasur-able activities (including sex), become withdrawn, cravecarbohydrates, and gain weight.\\nDiagnosis\\nDoctors usually diagnose seasonal affective disorder\\nbased on the patient’s description of symptoms, includ-ing the time of year they occur.\\nTreatment\\nThe first-line treatment for seasonal affective disor-\\nder is light therapy, exposing the patient to bright artifi-cial light to compensate for the gloominess of winter.Light therapy uses a device called a light box, which con-tains a set of fluorescent or incandescent lights in front ofa reflector. Typically, the patient sits for 30 minutes nextto a 10,000-lux box (which is about 50 times as bright asordinary indoor light). Light therapy appears to be safefor most people. However, it may be harmful for thosewith eye diseases. The most common side effects arevision problems such as eye strain, headaches, irritabili-ty, and insomnia . In addition, hypomania (elevated or\\nexpansive mood, characterized by hyperactivity andinflated self esteem) may occasionally occur.\\nRecently, researchers have begun testing whether\\npeople who do not completely respond to light therapycan benefit from tiny doses of the hormone melatonin toreset the body’s internal clock. Early results look promis-ing, but the potential benefits must be confirmed in largerstudies before this type of treatment becomes widelyaccepted.\\nLike other types of mood disorders , seasonal affec-\\ntive disorder may also respond to medication and psy-chotherapy. The four different classes of drugs used formood disorders are:\\n• heterocyclic antidepressants (HCAs), such as amitripty-\\nline (Elavil)\\n• selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as\\nfluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline(Zoloft)\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2979Seasonal affective disorderGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 2979'),\n",

Dandruff and cradle cap aremild forms of seborrheic dermatitis, and appear as finewhite scales without inflammation.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of seborrheic dermatitis is unclear, though\\nit is has been linked to genetic or environmental factors.Pityrosporum ovale , a species of yeast normally found in\\nhair follicles, has been proposed as one possiblecausative factor. A high fat diet and alcohol ingestion arethought to play some role. Other possible risk factorsinclude:\\n• stress and fatigue\\n• weather extremes (e. g. hot, humid weather or cold, dry\\nweather)\\n• oily skin• infrequent shampoos• obesity• Parkinson’s disease• AIDS• use of drying lotions that contain alcohol• other skin disorders (for example acne ,rosacea ,o r\\npsoriasis)\\nMild forms of the disorder may be asymptomatic.\\nSymptoms also disappear and reappear, and vary inintensity over time.

The\\nresulting excess of red cells thickens the blood andimpedes its passage through small blood vessels.\\nSecondary polycythemia usually affects people\\nbetween the ages of 40 and 60.\\nTypes of secondary polycythemia\\nKnown as spurious polycythemia, stress poly-\\ncythemia, or Gaisbock’s syndrome, relative polycythemiais characterized by normal numbers of red blood cells butdecreased levels of plasma (the fluid part of the blood).Overweight, middle-aged white men who smoke, havehigh blood pressure, and are on diuretic medicines toremove excess water from their bodies may develop Gais-bock’s syndrome.\\nIn smoker’s polycythemia, the number of red blood\\ncells is elevated. Plasma levels are abnormally low.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSmoking , which impairs red blood cells’ ability to\\ndeliver oxygen to body tissues, can cause secondarypolycythemia. So can the following conditions:\\n• carbon monoxide poisoning\\n• chronic heart or lung disease\\n• hormonal (endocrine) disorders• exposure to high altitudes• kidney cysts\\n• tumors of the brain, liver, or uterus\\nCauses of spurious polycythemia include:\\n• burns• diarrhea• hemoconcentration (higher-than-normal concentration\\nof cells and solids in the blood, usually due to becom-ing dehydrated or taking diuretics )\\n• stress\\nWeakness, headaches, and fatigue are usually the\\nfirst symptoms of secondary polycythemia. Patients mayfeel lightheaded or experience shortness of breath .\\nVisual disturbances associated with this disorder\\ninclude distorted vision, blind spots, and flashes of light.The gums and small cuts are likely to bleed, and thehands and feet may burn. Extensive itching often occurs\\nafter taking a bath or shower.Pain in the chest or leg muscles is common. The\\nface often becomes ruddy, then turns blue after exercise\\nor other exertion. Confusion and ringing in the ears ( tin-\\nnitus ) may also occur.\\nDiagnosis\\nA very important part of diagnosing secondary poly-\\ncythemia is differentiating it from primary polycythemia(also called polycythemia rubra vera or Vaquez’ disease).Unlike secondary polycythemia, primary polycythemiacannot be traced to an underlying condition such assmoking, high altitude, or chronic lung disease.\\nDoctors diagnose polycythemia by measuring oxygen\\nlevels in blood drawn from an artery. A patient whose oxy-gen level is abnormally low probably has secondary poly-cythemia. Erythropoietin may also be measured. Levels ofthis hormone, which stimulates the bone marrow to pro-duce red blood cells, may be normal or elevated in apatient with secondary polycythemia. Red blood cell massis also frequently measured in diagnosing the disorder.\\nImaging studies are sometimes performed to deter-\\nmine whether the spleen and liver are enlarged and todetect erythropoietin-producing kidney lesions. Otherdiagnostic procedures include chest x rays and an elec-trocardiogram (EKG).\\nTreatment\\nSecondary polycythemia is treated primarily by treat-\\ning the underlying condition causing the disorder. Forexample, patients with Gaisbock’s syndrome are oftentaken off diuretics and encouraged to lose weight. Lungdisorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD), may cause secondary polycythemia; treating thelung disorder generally improves the polycythemia.\\nSome medications may also be taken to treat symp-\\ntoms caused by polycythemia. For example, antihista-\\nmines can alleviate itching, and aspirin can soothe burn-\\ning sensations and bone pain.\\nUntil the underlying condition is controlled, doctors\\nuse bloodletting ( phlebotomy ) to reduce the number of\\nred blood cells in the patient’s body. In most instances, apint of blood is drained from the patient as needed andtolerated, until the hematocrit (the proportion of red cells\\nin the blood) reaches an acceptable level. Chemotherapy\\nis not used to treat secondary polycythemia; however, itmay be used to treat the primary form.\\nPrognosis\\nCuring or removing the underlying cause of this dis-\\norder generally eliminates the symptoms.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2982Secondary polycythemiaGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 2982'),\n",

A sedative is a medication that commonlyinduces the nervous system to calm.\\nPurpose\\nThe process of sedation has two primary intentions.\\nFirst, sedation is recommended to allow patients the abili-ty to tolerate unpleasant diagnostic or surgical proceduresand to relieve anxiety and discomfort. Second, sedation\\nfor uncooperative patients may expedite and simplify spe-cial procedures that require little or no movement. Addi-tionally, sedation is often desirable to diminish fear asso-ciated with operative procedures. Sedation is typicallyused for common diagnostic tests that require prolongedimmobilization such as magnetic resonance imaging\\n(MRI) and computed axial tomography (CAT) scanning.Some cases that require sedation may also necessitate theuse of analgesics to decrease pain associated with a pro-\\ncedure or test.\\nPrecautions\\nBenzodiazepines (common sedative medication)\\nhave a cumulative effect. This means that if the patienthas not had time to metabolize the previous dose andingests more, then the sedative effect may increase.Because of these additive effects these medications takenwith other sedatives or alcohol (also a sedative hypnoticdrug) may increase chances for accidental death . In gen-eral, most of the medications that induce sedation may\\nalter breathing and cardiac stability. In patients with pre-existing lung and/or heart disease, these medicationsshould be monitored closely or not prescribed.\\nDescription\\nThe future of anesthetic care involves the simultane-\\nous administration of several drugs including IV medica-tions and inhaled anesthetics. An extensive survey ofdeath in 100,000 cases published in 1988 revealed thatdeath within seven days was 2.9 times greater when oneor two anesthetic drugs were used than when using threeor more medications. As of 2000 this study is accepted asstandard practice and multiple IV anesthetics is thepreferable recommendation for optimal patient care.\\nThe procedure for sedation is usually explained to\\nthe patient by an attending clinician. An IV access line isset in place for fluid replacement and injection of med-ications. A history is usually taken to assess risk andchoice of medication. The patient typically signs consentforms and the possible side effects are explained. Theday before the test, the patient may be required to main-tain specified dietary restriction.\\nFor outpatient surgery there are two types of seda-\\ntion, conscious and unconscious sedation. Patientsreceiving conscious sedation are capable of rationalresponses, and they are able to maintain their airway forventilation. The hallmark of conscious sedation is that itdoes not alter respiratory, cardiac, or reflex functions(nerve reflexes from the brain) to the level that requiresexternal support for these vital functions. Patients receiv-ing conscious sedation are cooperative, have stable vitalsigns (pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature), shorterrecovery room convalescence, and lower risk of develop-ing drug-induced complications. Unconscious sedation isa controlled state of anesthesia, characterized by partialor complete loss of protective nerve reflexes, includingthe ability to independently breathe and respond to com-mands. The patient is unable to cooperate, has labile(fluctuating) vital signs, prolonged recovery room conva-lescence, and higher risk of anesthetic complications.\\nPreparation\\nUsually procedures for conscious sedation do not\\nrequire preoperative or pre-testing orders. Clinical situa-tions for unconscious sedation typically involve eating anddrinking protocols starting the day before the procedure.\\nThe age and physical status of the patient is useful in\\ndetermining sensitivity. A detailed past history, especiallyprior experiences with sedatives and other anesthetics isan important part of preparatory assessment.

Patient positioningis important to prevent blood pressure changes or nervedamage associated with abnormal position.\\nPatients are also monitored for pulse rate, respira-\\ntion, blood pressure, and temperature. Additionally, theheart is monitored using electrocardiography (ECG).\\nVentilation is assessed using a pulse oximeter. Thismachine is clipped with a special probe on one finger andcan measure the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide,which are reliable indicators of respiratory status.\\nAftercare\\nThe major goal for recovery room monitoring is\\nassessment of residual drug effects. Recovery room mon-itoring primarily focuses on heart stability, respiratoryadequacy and return to previous brain functioning.\\nRisks\\nThe original forms of diazepam (Valium, a very\\ncommon sedative) caused irritation of veins andphlebitis. Newer forms of diazepam (Dizac) are chemi-cally improved to lower the possibility of vein irritation.Age and physical health are important risk factors. Pre-existing medical conditions such as high blood pressureand heart and lung disease may increase the chance ofdeveloping undesirable side effects.\\nNormal results\\nNormal or uncomplicated results for sedation\\ninclude alleviation of anxiety and discomfort. Coupledwith analgesic, patients are usually pain-free. The normalprogression post procedure or post operatively would beto return to baseline brain functioning, unassisted breath-ing, and normal heart rate and rhythm.\\nAbnormal results\\nPatients may have excessive nausea and vomiting\\nassociated with narcotic analgesia (if this is indicated).Excessive drowsiness can occur secondary to benzodi-azepine-induced sedation.

Epilepsy is a condition characterized by recurrentseizures that may include repetitive muscle jerking calledconvulsions.\\nDescription\\nThere are more than 20 different seizure disorders.\\nOne in ten Americans will have a seizure at some time,and at least 200,000 have at least one seizure a month.\\nEpilepsy affects 1–2% of the population of the United\\nStates. Although epilepsy is as common in adults over 60as in children under 10, 25% of all cases develop before theage of five. One in every two cases develops before the ageof 25. About 125,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosedeach year, and a significant number of children and adultsthat have not been diagnosed or treated have epilepsy.\\nMost seizures are benign, but a seizure that lasts a\\nlong time can lead to status epilepticus, a life-threateningcondition characterized by continuous seizures, sus-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2984Seizure disorderGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 2984'),\n",

Undiagnosed seizures canlead to conditions that are more serious and more diffi-cult to manage.\\nTypes of seizures\\nGeneralized epileptic seizures occur when electrical\\nabnormalities exist throughout the brain. A partialseizure does not involve the entire brain. A partial seizurebegins in an area called an epileptic focus, but mayspread to other parts of the brain and cause a generalizedseizure. Some people who have epilepsy have more thanone type of seizure.\\nMotor attacks cause parts of the body to jerk repeat-\\nedly. A motor attack usually lasts less than an hour andmay last only a few minutes. Sensory seizures begin withnumbness or tingling in one area. The sensation may movealong one side of the body or the back before subsiding.\\nVisual seizures, which affect the area of the brain\\nthat controls sight, cause people to see things that are notthere. Auditory seizures affect the part of the brain thatcontrols hearing and cause the patient to imagine voices,music, and other sounds. Other types of seizures cancause confusion, upset stomach, or emotional distress.\\nGENERALIZED SEIZURES. A generalized tonic-clonic\\n(grand-mal) seizure begins with a loud cry before theperson having the seizure loses consciousness and fallsto the ground. The muscles become rigid for about 30seconds during the tonic phase of the seizure and alter-nately contract and relax during the clonic phase, whichlasts 30–60 seconds. The skin sometimes acquires abluish tint and the person may bite his tongue, lose bowelor bladder control, or have trouble breathing.\\nA grand mal seizure lasts between two and five min-\\nutes, and the person may be confused or have troubletalking when he regains consciousness (post-ictal state).He may complain of head or muscle aches, or weaknessin his arms or legs before falling into a deep sleep.\\nPRIMARY GENERALIZED SEIZURES. A primary gener-\\nalized seizure occurs when electrical discharges begin inboth halves (hemispheres) of the brain at the same time.Primary generalized seizures are more likely to be majormotor attacks than to be absence seizures.\\nABSENCE SEIZURES. Absence (petit mal) seizures\\ngenerally begin at about the age of four and stop by thetime the child becomes an adolescent.\\nAbsence seizures usually begin with a brief loss of\\nconsciousness and last between one and 10 seconds. Aperson having a petit mal seizure becomes very quiet andmay blink, stare blankly, roll his eyes, or move his lips. A\\npetit mal seizure lasts 15-20 seconds. When it ends, theperson who had the seizure resumes whatever he wasdoing before the seizure began. He will not remember theseizure and may not realize that anything unusual has hap-pened. Untreated, petit mal seizures can recur as many as100 times a day and may progress to grand mal seizures.\\nMYOCLONIC SEIZURES. Myoclonic seizures are\\ncharacterized by brief, involuntary spasms of the tongueor muscles of the face, arms, or legs. Myoclonic seizuresare most apt to occur when waking after a night’s sleep.\\nA jacksonian seizure is a partial seizure character-\\nized by tingling, stiffening, or jerking of an arm or leg.Loss of consciousness is rare.

Complex partial seizures canbecome major motor seizures. Although a person hav-ing a complex partial seizure may not seem to beunconscious, he does not know what is happening andmay behave inappropriately. He will not remember theseizure, but may seem confused or intoxicated for afew minutes after it ends.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe origin of 50-70% of all cases of epilepsy is\\nunknown. Epilepsy is sometimes the result of trauma atthe time of birth. Such causes include insufficient oxygento the brain; head injury ; heavy bleeding or incompati-\\nbility between a woman’s blood and the blood of hernewborn baby; and infection immediately before, after,or at the time of birth.\\nOther causes of epilepsy include:\\n• head trauma resulting from a car accident, gunshot\\nwound, or other injury\\n• alcoholism• brain abscess or inflammation of membranes covering\\nthe brain or spinal cord\\n• phenylketonuria (PKU, a disease that is present at birth,\\nis often characterized by seizures, and can result inmental retardation ) and other inherited disorders\\n• infectious diseases like measles ,mumps , and diphtheria.\\n• degenerative disease• lead poisoning , mercury poisoning, carbon monoxide\\npoisoning , or ingestion of some other poisonous sub-\\nstance\\n• genetic factors\\nStatus epilepticus, a condition in which a person suf-\\nfers from continuous seizures and may have troublebreathing, can be caused by:\\n• suddenly discontinuing anti-seizure medication• hypoxic or metabolic encephalopathy (brain disease\\nresulting from lack of oxygen or malfunctioning ofother physical or chemical processes)\\n• acute head injury• blood infection caused by inflammation of the brain or\\nthe membranes that cover it\\nDiagnosis\\nPersonal and family medical history, description of\\nseizure activity, and physical and neurological examina-tions help primary care physicians, neurologists, and\\nepileptologists diagnose this disorder. Doctors rule outconditions that cause symptoms that resemble epilepsy,including small strokes (transient ischemic attacks, orTIAs), fainting (syncope), pseudoseizures, and sleep\\nattacks ( narcolepsy ).\\nNeuropsychological testing uncovers learning or\\nmemory problems. Neuro-imaging provides views ofbrain areas involved in seizure activity.\\nThe electroencephalogram (EEG) is the main test\\nused to diagnose epilepsy. EEGs use electrodes placed onor within the skull to record the brain’s electrical activityand pinpoint the exact location of abnormal discharges.\\nThe patient may be asked to remain motionless dur-\\ning a short-term EEG or to go about his normal activitiesduring extended monitoring. Some patients are deprivedof sleep or exposed to seizure triggers, such as rapid,deep breathing (hyperventilation) or flashing lights(photic stimulation). In some cases, people may be hos-pitalized for EEG monitorings that can last as long astwo weeks. Video EEGs also document what the patientwas doing when the seizure occurred and how the seizurechanged his behavior.\\nOther techniques used to diagnose epilepsy include:\\n• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which provides\\nclear, detailed images of the brain. Functional MRI(fMRI), performed while the patient does various tasks,can measure shifts in electrical intensity and blood flowand indicate which brain region each activity affects.\\n• Positron emission tomography ( PET ) and single photon\\nemission tomography (SPECT) monitor blood flow andchemical activity in the brain area being tested. PET andSPECT are very effective in locating the brain regionwhere metabolic changes take place between seizures.\\nTreatment\\nThe goal of epilepsy treatment is to eliminate\\nseizures or make the symptoms less frequent and lesssevere. Long-term anticonvulsant drug therapy is themost common form of epilepsy treatment.\\nMedication\\nA combination of drugs may be needed to control\\nsome symptoms, but most patients who have epilepsytake one of the following medications:\\n• Dilantin (phenytoin)\\n• Tegretol (carbamazepine)• Barbita (phenobarbital)• Mysoline (primidone)\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2986Seizure disorderGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 2986'),\n",

Surgical techniques used to\\ntreat intractable epilepsy include:\\n• Lesionectomy. Removing the lesion (diseased brain tis-\\nsue) and some surrounding brain tissue is very effectivein controlling seizures. Lesionectomy is generally moresuccessful than surgery performed on patients whoseseizures are not caused by clearly defined lesions, butremoving only part of the lesion lessens the effective-ness of the procedure.\\n• Temporal resections. Removing part of the temporal\\nlobe and the part of the brain associated with feelings,memory, and emotions (the hippocampus) providesgood or excellent seizure control in 75-80% of properlyselected patients with appropriate types of temporallobe epilepsy. Some patients experience post-operativespeech and memory problems.\\n• Extra-temporal resection. This procedure involves\\nremoving some or all of the frontal lobe, the part of thebrain directly behind the forehead. The frontal lobehelps regulate movement, planning, judgment, and per-sonality, and special care must be taken to prevent post-operative problems with movement and speech. Extra-temporal resection is most successful in patients whoseseizures are not widespread.\\n• Hemispherectomy. This method of removing brain tis-\\nsue is restricted to patients with severe epilepsy andabnormal discharges that often extend from one side ofthe brain to the other. Hemispherectomies are mostoften performed on infants or young children who havehad an extensive brain disease or disorder since birth orfrom a very young age.\\n• Corpus callosotomy. This procedure, an alternative to\\nhemispherectomy in patients with congenital hemiple-gia, removes some or all of the white matter that sepa-rates the two halves of the brain. Corpus callosotomy isperformed almost exclusively on children who are fre-quently injured during falls caused by seizures. Ifremoving two-thirds of the corpus callosum doesn’tproduce lasting improvement in the patient’s condition,the remaining one-third will be removed during anotheroperation.\\n• Multiple subpial transection. This procedure is used to\\ncontrol the spread of seizures that originate in or affectthe “eloquent” cortex, the area of the brain responsiblefor complex thought and reasoning.\\nOther forms of treatment\\nKETOGENIC DIET. A special high-fat, low-protein,\\nlow-carbohydrate diet is sometimes used to treat patientswhose severe seizures have not responded to other treat-\\nment. Calculated according to age, height, and weight,the ketogenic diet induces mild starvation and dehydra-\\ntion. This forces the body to create an excessive supply\\nof ketones, natural chemicals with seizure-suppressingproperties.\\nThe goal of this controversial approach is to main-\\ntain or improve seizure control while reducing medica-tion. The ketogenic diet works best with childrenbetween the ages of one and 10. It is introduced over aperiod of several days, and most children are hospitalizedduring the early stages of treatment.\\nIf a child following this diet remains seizure-free for\\nat least six months, increased amounts of carbohydratesand protein are gradually added. If the child shows noimprovement after three months, the diet is gradually dis-continued.\\nIntroduced in the 1920s, the ketogenic diet has had\\nlimited, short-term success in controlling seizure activity.Its use exposes patients to such potentially harmful sideeffects as:\\n• staphylococcal infections\\n• stunted or delayed growth\\n• low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia )\\n• excess fat in the blood (hyperlipidemia)\\n• disease resulting from calcium deposits in the urinary\\ntract (urolithiasis)\\n• disease of the optic nerve (optic neuropathy)\\nVAGUS NERVE STIMULATION. The United States\\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved theuse of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in patients overthe age of 16 who have intractable partial seizures. Thisnon-surgical procedure uses a pacemaker-like deviceimplanted under the skin in the upper left chest, to pro-vide intermittent stimulation to the vagus nerve.Stretching from the side of the neck into the brain, thevagus nerve affects swallowing, speech, breathing, andmany other functions, and VNS may prevent or shortensome seizures.\\nFirst aid for seizures\\nA person having a seizure should not be restrained,\\nbut sharp or dangerous objects should be moved out ofreach. Anyone having a complex partial seizure can bewarned away from danger by someone calling his/hername in a clear, calm voice.\\nA person having a grand mal seizure should be\\nhelped to lie down.

Forcing a\\nhard object into the mouth of someone having a grandmal seizure could cause injuries or breathing problems.If the person’s mouth is open, placing a folded cloth orother soft object between his teeth will protect histongue. Turning his head to the side will help himbreathe. After a grand mal seizure has ended, the personwho had the seizure should be told what has happenedand reminded of where he is.\\nAlternative treatment\\nStress increases seizure activity in 30% of people\\nwho have epilepsy. Relaxation techniques can providesome sense of control over the disorder, but they shouldnever be used instead of anti-seizure medication or usedwithout the approval of the patient’s doctor. Yoga ,medi-\\ntation , and favorite pastimes help some people relax and\\nmanage stress more successfully. Biofeedback can teach\\nadults and older adolescents how to recognize an auraand what to do to stop its spread. Children under 14 arenot usually able to understand and apply principles ofbiofeedback. Acupuncture treatments (acupuncture nee-\\ndles inserted for a few minutes or left in place for as longas half an hour) make some people feel pleasantlyrelaxed. Acupressure can have the same effect on chil-\\ndren or on adults who dislike needles.\\nAromatherapy involves mixing aromatic plant oils\\ninto water or other oils and massaging them into the skinor using a special burner to waft their fragrance through-out the room. Aromatherapy oils affect the body and thebrain, and undiluted oils should never be applied directlyto the skin. Ylang ylang, chamomile, or lavender can cre-ate a soothing mood. People who have epilepsy shouldnot use rosemary, hyssop, sage or sweet fennel, whichseem to make the brain more alert.\\nDietary changes that emphasize whole foods and\\neliminate processed foods may be helpful. Homeopathictherapy also can work for people with seizures, especiallyconstitutional homeopathic treatment that acts at the deep-est levels to address the needs of the individual person.\\nPrognosis\\nPeople who have epilepsy have a higher-than-aver-\\nage rate of suicide; sudden, unexplained death ; and\\ndrowning and other accidental fatalities.\\nBenign focal epilepsy of childhood and some absence\\nseizures may disappear in time, but remission is unlikely ifseizures occur several times a day, several times in a 48-hour period, or more frequently than in the past.\\nSeizures that occur repeatedly over time and always\\ninvolve the same symptoms are called stereotypicseizures. The probability that stereotypic seizures will\\nabate is poor.\\nAbout 85% of all seizure disorders can be partially\\nor completely controlled if the patient takes anti-seizuremedication according to directions; avoids seizure-induc-ing sights, sounds, and other triggers; gets enough sleep;and eats regular, balanced meals.\\nAnyone who has epilepsy should wear a bracelet or\\nnecklace identifying his seizure disorder and listing themedication he takes.\\nPrevention\\nEating properly, getting enough sleep, and control-\\nling stress and fevers can help prevent seizures. A per-son who has epilepsy should be careful not to hyperven-tilate. A person who experiences an aura should find asafe place to lie down and stay there until the seizurepasses. Anticonvulsant medications should not bestopped suddenly and, if other medications are pre-scribed or discontinued, the doctor treating the seizuresshould be notified. In some conditions, such as severehead injury, brain surgery, or subarachnoid hemor-\\nrhage , anticonvulsant medications may be given to the\\npatient to prevent seizures.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nShaw, Michael, ed.

Like other antidepressant\\ndrugs , they help reduce the extreme sadness, hopeless-\\nness, and lack of interest in life that are typical in peoplewith depression. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitorsalso are used to treat panic disorder , obsessive compul-\\nsive disorder (OCD), and have shown promise for treat-ing a variety of other conditions, such as premenstrual\\nsyndrome , eating disorders, obesity ,self-mutilation ,\\nand migraine headache .\\nDescription\\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, also known\\nas SSRIs or serotonin boosters, are thought to work bycorrecting chemical imbalances in the brain. Normally,chemicals called neurotransmitters carry signals fromone nerve cell to another. These chemicals are constantlybeing released and taken back up at the ends of nervecells. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors act on oneparticular neurotransmitter, serotonin, reducing its re-entry into nerve cells and thus allowing serotonin to buildup. Although scientists are not exactly sure how it works,serotonin is involved in the control of moods, as well asother functions such as sleep, body temperature, andappetite for sweets and other carbohydrates. Somehow,drugs that prevent the uptake of serotonin improve themoods of people with serious depression, OCD, andsome types of anxiety disorders .\\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are available\\nonly with a doctor’s prescription and are sold in tablet,capsule, and liquid forms. Commonly used selectiveserotonin reuptake inhibitors are fluoxetine (Prozac),paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), and fluvoxamine(Luvox).\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\nSSRI and the type and severity of depression for which itis being taken. Dosages may be different for differentpeople. It is important for people taking SSRIs to takethe drug exactly as prescribed. Taking larger or more fre-quent doses or taking the drug for longer than directed,for example, can cause unwanted effects.\\nSSRIs are about as effective as other antidepres-\\nsants. About 60-80% of people taking the drugs as direct-ed will find that their conditions improve. However, itmay take four weeks or more for the effects of this medi-cine to be felt. Therefore, when people begin SSRI thera-py, it is important to continue taking the medication, evenif an improvement in mood doesn’t begin immediately.\\nPeople who take SSRIs should ask their doctors\\nabout how to stop taking the medication.

It isnot clear whether the medicine causes this effect becausesuicidal thoughts are very often a part of depressionitself. While some patients may experience worsening ofsuch thoughts early in the treatment of their depression,there is no credible evidence that SSRIs alone cause peo-ple to become suicidal or violent.\\nSerious and possibly life-threatening reactions may\\noccur when SSRIs are used in combination with mono-\\namine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors), such as\\nNardil and Parnate, which also are used to treat depres-sion. These reactions also are possible when a personstops taking an SSRI and immediately begins taking anMAOI. SSRIs and MAO inhibitors should never be takenat the same time. When switching from an SSRI to anMAOI or vice versa, it may be necessary to allow two tofive weeks or more between stopping one and starting theother. The physician prescribing the medications shouldtell the patient exactly how much time to allow beforebeginning the other medication.\\nPeople with a history of manic disorders should use\\nany antidepressant, including an SSRI, with caution.\\nIt is important to see a doctor regularly while taking\\nSSRIs. The doctor will check to make sure the medicineis working as it should and will watch for unwanted sideeffects. The doctor may also need to adjust the dosageduring this period.\\nSome people feel drowsy, dizzy, or lightheaded\\nwhen using SSRIs. The drugs may also cause blurredvision in some people. Since SSRIs can sometimes causedrowsiness, driving or operating heavy machinery shouldbe undertaken cautiously, particularly when the personfirst begins taking the medication.\\nThese medicines make some people feel lighthead-\\ned, dizzy, or faint when they get up after sitting or lyingdown, a condition known as orthostatic hypotension .\\nPeople may try to lessen the problem by getting up grad-ually and holding onto something for support if possible.If the problem is severe or doesn’t improve, the patientshould discuss it with his or her doctor.\\nBecause SSRIs work on the central nervous system,\\nthey may add to the effects of alcohol and other drugsthat slow down the central nervous system, such as anti-histamines , cold medicine, allergy medicine, sleep aids,\\nmedicine for seizures, tranquilizers, some pain relievers,\\nand muscle relaxants . They may also add to the effects\\nof anesthetics, including those used for dental proce-dures. Anyone taking SSRIs should check with his or herdoctor before taking any of the drugs mentioned above.\\nSSRIs may occasionally cause dry mouth , although\\nthis side effect is much more common with an older classof antidepressants known as tricyclics. To temporarilyrelieve the discomfort, doctors sometimes suggest chew-ing sugarless gum, sucking on sugarless candy or icechips, or using saliva substitutes, which come in liquidand tablet forms and are available without a prescription.If the problem continues for more than two weeks, checkwith a doctor or dentist. Mouth dryness that continuesover a long time may contribute to tooth decay and other\\ndental problems.\\nChanges in sexual functioning are among the more\\ncommon side effects with SSRIs. Depending on the par-ticular SSRI prescribed, 8-15% of patients may reportthese side effects. The most common problem for men isdelayed ejaculation. Women may be unable to haveorgasms. A doctor should be contacted if any changes insexual functioning occur.\\nSpecial conditions\\nPeople with certain medical conditions or who are\\ntaking certain other medicines can have problems if theytake SSRIs. Before taking these drugs, a patient shouldlet the doctor know about any of these conditions:\\nALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions\\nto SSRIs in the past should let his or her doctor knowbefore taking the drugs again. The doctor should also betold about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or\\nother substances.\\nPREGNANCY. In studies of laboratory animals, some\\nSSRIs have caused miscarriage and other problems in\\npregnant females and their offspring. However, at leasttwo studies in humans (by Pastuszak in 1993 and Kuhlinin 1998) have shown SSRIs to be safe during pregnancy .\\nStill, women who are pregnant or who may become preg-nant should check with their doctors before using SSRIs.\\nBREASTFEEDING. SSRIs pass into breast milk and\\nsome may occasionally cause unwanted side effects innursing babies whose mothers take the drugs. Theseeffects include vomiting, watery stools, crying, and sleepproblems. Women who are breastfeeding should talk totheir doctors about the use of SSRIs. They may need toswitch to a different medicine while breastfeeding. IfSSRIs must be taken, it may be necessary to stop breast-feeding while being treated with these drugs.

Before using SSRIs,\\npeople with any of these medical problems should makesure their doctors are aware of their conditions: diabetes,kidney disease, liver disease, seizure disorders, current orpast drug abuse or dependence, or diseases or conditionsthat affect the metabolism or blood circulation.\\nSide effects\\nThe most common side effects are anxiety and ner-\\nvousness (reported by 5–13% of people taking variousSSRIs), tremor (5–14%), trouble sleeping (2–8%), tired-ness or weakness (4–15%), nausea (11–26%), diarrhea\\n(11–26%), constipation (1–8%), loss of appetite\\n(3–18%), weight loss (1–13%), dry mouth (10–22%),headache (1–5%), sweating (5–9%), trouble urinating\\n(1–2%), and decreased sexual ability (8–15%). Many ofthese problems diminish or disappear as the body adjuststo the drug and do not require medical treatment unlessthey interfere with normal activities. Persistent problems,such as sexual dysfunction , should be discussed with\\nthe doctor.\\nMore serious side effects are possible, but extremely\\nrare. People taking SSRIs who notice unusual joint ormuscle pain; breathing problems; chills or fever ; exces-\\nsive excitement, fast talking, or actions that are out ofcontrol; or mood swings should contact their doctors.People who develop skin rashes or hives after taking an\\nSSRI should stop taking the medication and contact theirdoctors as soon as possible. Other rare side effects mayoccur. Anyone who has unusual symptoms after takingan SSRI should get in touch with his or her doctor.\\nSide effects may continue for some time after treat-\\nment with this medicine ends. How long the effects con-tinue depends on how long the drug was taken and howmuch of it was used. In most cases, doctors recommendthat patients taper off SSRIs rather than abruptly discon-tinuing them, which usually prevents any withdrawalsymptoms. People who experience agitation, confusion,or restlessness; dizziness or lightheadedness; vision\\nproblems; tremor; sleep problems; unusual tiredness orweakness; nausea and vomiting or diarrhea; headache;\\nexcessive sweating; runny nose; or muscle pain for morethan a few days after stopping or tapering an SSRIshould consult their doctors.KEY TERMS\\nAnesthetic —Medicine that causes a loss of feel-\\ning, especially of pain.

Others include biting, hit-ting, or bruising oneself; picking or pulling at skin orhair; burning oneself with lighted cigarettes, or amputat-ing parts of the body.\\nDescription\\nSelf-mutilation has become a major public health\\nconcern as its incidence appears to have risen since theearly 1990s. One source estimates that 0.75% of the gener-al American population practices self-mutilation. The inci-dence of self-mutilation is highest among teenage females,patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder,and patients diagnosed with one of the dissociative disor-\\nders. Over half of self-mutilators were sexually abused as\\nchildren, and many also suffer from eating disorders.\\nSelf-mutilation should not be confused with current\\nfads for tattoos and body piercing. In some cases, howev-er, it may be difficult to distinguish between an interest inthese fads and the first indications of a disorder.\\nThe relationship of self-mutilation to suicide is still\\ndebated even though statistics show that nearly 50% ofindividuals who injure themselves also attempt suicide atsome point in their lives. Many researchers think that sui-cide attempts reflect feelings of rejection or hopeless-ness, while self-mutilation results from feelings of shameor a need to relieve tension.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSeveral different theories have been proposed to\\nexplain self-mutilation:\\n• self-mutilation is an outlet for strong negative emo-\\ntions, especially anger or shame, that the person isafraid to express in words or discuss with others.\\n• self-mutilation represents anger at someone else direct-\\ned against the self.\\n• self-mutilation relieves unbearable tension or anxiety .\\nMany self-mutilators do report feeling relief after anepisode of self-cutting or other injury.\\n• self-mutilation is a technique for triggering the body’s\\nbiochemical responses to pain . Stress and trauma\\nrelease endorphins, which are the body’s natural pain-killing substances.\\n• self-mutilation is a way of stopping a dissociative\\nepisode. Dissociation is a process in which the mind splitsoff, or dissociates, certain memories and thoughts that aretoo painful to keep in conscious awareness. Some peoplereport that they feel “numb” or “dead” when they dissoci-ate, and self-injury allows them to feel “alive.”\\n• self-mutilation is a symbolic acting-out of the larger\\nculture’s mistreatment of women. This theory is some-times offered to explain why the great majority (about75%) of self-mutilators are girls and women.\\nThe symptoms of self-mutilation typically include\\nwearing long-sleeved or baggy clothing, even in hotweather; and an unusual need for privacy. Self-mutilatorsare often hesitant to change their clothes or undressaround others. In most cases the person has also shownsigns of depression.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2993Self-mutilationGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 2993'),\n",

Success ofvasectomy is confirmed by the absence of sperm in semen.\\nDescription\\nThe semen analysis test is usually done manually,\\nthough computerized test systems are available. Manylaboratories base their procedures on standards publishedby the World Health Organization (WHO).\\nThe volume of semen in the entire ejaculate is mea-\\nsured. The appearance, color, thickness, and pH is noted.A pH test looks at the range from a very acid solution toa very alkaline solution. Semen, like many other bodyfluids, has a standard pH range that would be consideredoptimal for fertilization of the egg to take place. Thethick semen is then allowed to liquify; this usually takes20-60 minutes.\\nDrops of semen are placed on a microscope slide\\nand examined under the microscope. Motility, or move-ment, of 100 sperm are observed and graded in cate-gories, such as rapid progressive or immotile.\\nThe structure of sperm (sperm morphology) is\\nassessed by carefully examining sperm for abnormali-ties in the size and shape in the head, tail, and neckregions. WHO standards define normal as a specimenwith less than 30% abnormal forms. An alternative clas-sification system (Kruger’s) measures the dimensions ofsperm parts. Normal specimens are allowed 14% or lessabnormalities.\\nSperm are counted by placing semen in a special\\ncounting chamber. The sperm within the chamber arecounted under a microscope.

These are believed tocontribute to sperm health and fertility.\\nResults of semen analysis for infertility must be con-\\nfirmed by a second analysis seven days to three monthsafter the first. Sperm counts may vary from day to day.\\nSemen analysis to confirm success of vasectomy is\\nconcerned only with discovering if sperm are still pre-sent. Semen is collected six weeks after surgery. If spermare seen, another specimen is collected two to four weekslater. The test is repeated until two consecutive speci-mens are free of sperm.KEY TERMS\\nInfertility —The inability of a man and woman to\\nconceive a child after 12 months of unprotectedsexual intercourse.\\nMorphology —The size and shape of sperm.\\nMotility —The movement of sperm within the\\nsemen.\\nPreparation\\nA man should collect an entire ejaculate, by mastur-\\nbation, into a container provided by his physician. Toexamine the best quality sperm, the specimen must becollected after two to three days of sexual abstinence, butnot more than five to seven days. The specimen must notcome into contact with any spermicidal agents used by afemale partner for birth control purposes. The manshould not have alcohol before the test.\\nA semen specimen to investigate infertility must be\\nbrought to the testing laboratory within one hour ofobtaining it.

People who maintain ahealthy weight, exercise regularly, eat nutritionally, and\\ndon’t smoke reduce the risk for many health conditions.This wellness allows people to live longer and to remainindependent for more years. Smoking ,obesity (excess\\nweight), and lack of exercise shorten life and increase therisk for many health conditions.\\nDiet and exercise\\nProper diet and regular exercise form the foundation\\nof senior health. A nutritional diet and physical activitycan help prevent diseases such as heart disease, cancer ,\\nstroke , and diabetes. A healthy diet can also help to man-\\nage diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.\\nAs people age, there is more of a need to exercise on\\na regular basis. According to the American Heart Associ-ation, the inactive person loses from 3–5% of musclefiber each decade after age 30. That loss would total 30%of lost muscle fiber at age 60. Exercise helps to boostmuscle strength. It could help to improve balance andcoordination, and therefore help to prevent falls.\\nOrganizations including the heart association advise\\nthat regular physical activity helps to prevent bone loss(osteoporosis ) and the risk of conditions such as heart\\ndisease, Type II diabetes, colon cancer ,stress , and\\ndepression. In addition, exercise can help a extend thelives of people with conditions such as diabetes, highblood pressure, and high cholesterol .\\nOsteoporosis\\nOsteoporosis is a condition in which bones become\\nless dense (solid). Bones become brittle, thinner, andbreak easily. Although osteoporosis is associated withaging, it is only the risk of osteoporosis that increases asa person ages. It is linked to approximately 70% of bonefractures in people age 46 and older. According to the\\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH), one out of twowomen over age 50 will experience an osteoporosis-related fracture. So will one out of eight men over 50.\\nOsteoporosis is associated primarily with the\\nchanges that occur to women during menopause . During\\nmenopause, there is a decrease in the level of estrogen,the hormone that helps maintain bone mass. Other causesof osteoporosis include lack of exercise and a diet defi-cient in vitamin D.\\nOsteoporosis is a preventable condition.\\nOsteoarthritis\\nOsteoarthritis is a joint disease in which cartilage\\nwears out and bones rub against each other. This condi-tion can occur gradually over time as activities per-formed throughout the years cause wear on joints. Inaddition, bones thin as a person ages.\\nExcess weight and injuries can aggravate this condi-\\ntion. About 16 million Americans experience some formof osteoarthritis. It generally affects the neck, fingers,lower back, knees, and toes. Symptoms include pain ,\\nstiffness, swelling, and creaking. The pain may disruptsleep, and joint stiffness may make it difficult for a per-son to dress.\\nFalls\\nMore than two million Americans each year fall and\\nexperience serious injuries, according to the AmericanAcademy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.For seniors, fall-related injuries can reduce mobility andhinder independence.\\nAs people age, their reflexes slow down so it may be\\nmore difficult to prevent a fall. Deteriorating vision andhearing can affect balance, which can cause an accidentalfall. Furthermore, conditions such as arthritis, dizziness ,\\nand sleeping disorders can increase the likelihood of afall. In addition, a person may fall at the start of a condi-tion such as a stroke or heart attack .\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2996Seniors’ healthGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 2996'),\n",

In addition, healingtakes longer. Head injuries could affect sight and hear-ing. Injuries sustained during falls could reduce an activeperson’s mobility and independence.\\nVision\\nEyesight changes as people age. Generally, people\\nare in their 40s when they experience presbyopia , a form\\nof farsightedness. This is a progressive condition involv-ing a decrease in the ability the eye to focus on what isclose by (near vision). By age 65, little near focusingability remains.\\nGlaucoma is a condition caused by pressure from\\nthe build-up of a large amount of fluid in the eye. Thisprogressive condition is often seen in people in their 50s.It starts with the gradual loss of peripheral vision. If nottreated, it can lead to some vision loss.\\nPeople in their 60s may experience the first signs of\\nage-related macular degeneration (AMD). It is a pro-\\ngressive condition affecting the retina. The macula in theretina distinguishes detail. Degeneration in the maculacould cause scarring and a gradual reduction in vision.The person experiences a circle of blindness, an area ofsightlessness that grows as the condition progress.\\nMore than half of people age 65 or older will be\\ndiagnosed with cataracts . Cataract refers to the loss of\\nthe transparency in the lens of the eye. As the loss pro-gresses, the person is unable to see less detail. This con-dition generally affects both eyes.\\nHearing\\nPresbycusis, age-related hearing loss , is a progres-\\nsive condition. It usually starts with a difficulty in hear-ing high-frequency sound such as people talking. Asenior has less trouble with low-frequency tones. Back-ground noise will make it even more difficult to hear.Presbycusis affects approximately 25% of peoplebetween the ages of 65 and 75 and half of those over 75.Many people diagnosed with this condition say they havelost hearing in both ears. They also report feelings ofdizziness and that they experience a ringing in their ears.\\nSleep disorders\\nSleep patterns change when a person ages. Many\\npeople in their 60s and 70s experience less time in thestages of deep sleep known as delta sleep. Despite thischange, many healthy older people don’t experiencesleep disorders . Overall health plays a role in whether a\\nsenior experiences trouble sleeping.Obesity is linked to snoring and sleep apnea . Snor-\\ning can turn into apnea. A person with apnea stopsbreathing for up to one minute until the brain restarts thebreathing process. This action could be repeated severalhundred times each night.\\nFurthermore, a senior’s sleep can be disrupted by\\nconditions such as arthritis, osteoporosis, and Alz-\\nheimer’s disease . Insomnia , or the inability to stay\\nasleep, is a symptom of conditions including depression,anxiety , chronic pain, and restless leg syndrome (RLS).\\nRLS involves movement of legs when a person is at\\nrest. The person moves legs in response to a tingling sen-sation in the upper leg, calf, or foot. In other cases, legsmove involuntarily. Sensations that trigger movementcan re-occur within seconds.\\nA person with RLS is likely to have PLMD (periodic\\nlimb movement disorder). A sleeping person with thiscondition will kick legs or move arms repeatedly. Theseinvoluntary movements can last from 20 seconds to anhour. Approximately 45% of the elderly have a mild formof PLMD, according to the National Sleep Foundation.\\nThe cause of these disorders is not known. They are\\nthought to be caused by a chemical reaction in the brain.In addition, the conditions may be hereditary.\\nMental health\\nWhile age has little effect on the mind, social and\\nemotional factors affect an older person’s health. After alifetime of a work, retirement brings several challenges.A person who has been identified for years by a profes-sion may experience a sense of lost identity.\\nA senior may find that the thinking process has\\nchanged. Learning something new may take longer.However, older people have excellent recall of new infor-mation.\\nMemory loss may be a concern, particularly since\\nthis is a symptom of Alzheimer’s disease.\\nDementia\\nAlzheimer’s disease is a form of dementia , a condi-\\ntion in which mental abilities decline. Symptoms ofdementia include memory loss that goes beyond forget-ting a word or where an item was placed. The personwith dementia may never recognize family members orremember how to perform functions such as preparing ameal. Sometimes there is change in personality, with theperson becoming aggressive or paranoid.\\nAlzheimer’s disease is the most prevalent form of\\ndementia.

That ratio rose to one in threepeople age 85 and older.\\nAlzheimer’s is a progressive condition. In most\\ncases, after five to eight years, a patient with this condi-tion is unable to perform basic functions. As of May of2001, there was no cure for Alzheimer’s. However, byMarch of that year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administra-tion in March had approved four medications that couldhelp stop the degenerative process.\\nPrecautions\\nA health condition may result in a doctor recom-\\nmending against some forms of exercises. However, evenif a person can’t jog, other forms of exercise includethose designed for people in wheelchairs and those whoare bedridden.\\nTreatments for menopause and osteoporosis include\\nRaloxifene, a medication that may cause blood clots.\\nDescription\\nThe cost of treatment varies. Cost of medical treat-\\nment will be determined by the type of procedure andwhether a person has medical insurance. Another factoris the fee assessed by the health plan.\\nNutrition\\nNutrition plays an important role in senior health. Not\\nonly does a well-balanced diet keep a person from becom-ing obese, that same diet is a safeguard against health con-ditions that seniors face. Proper diet can help prevent a con-dition like diabetes or keep it from worsening.\\nThe senior diet should consist of foods that are low\\nin fat, particularly saturated fat and cholesterol. A personshould choose foods that provide nutrients such as ironand calcium. Other healthy menu choices include:\\n• fish, skinless poultry, and lean meat\\n• proteins such as dry beans (red beans, navy beans, and\\nsoybeans), lentils, chickpeas, and peanuts\\n• low-fat dairy products• vegetables, especially those that are dark green and\\nleafy\\n• citrus fruits or juices, melons, and berries\\n• whole grains like wheat, rice, oats, corn, and barley\\n• whole grain breads and cerealsExercise\\nPhysical activity should be rhythmic, repetitive, and\\nshould challenge the circulatory system. It should also beenjoyable so that a senior gets in the habit of exercisingregularly for 30 minutes each day. It may be necessary tocheck with a doctor to determine the type of exercise thatcan be done.\\nWalking is recommended for weight loss, stress\\nrelease, and many other conditions. Brisk walking is saidto produce the same benefits as jogging. Other forms ofexercise can include gardening, bicycling, hiking, swim-ming, dancing, skating or ice-skating. If weather pro-hibits outdoor activities, a person can work out indoorswith an exercise video.\\nExercise also offers a chance to socialize. In some\\ncities, groups of seniors meet for regular walks at shop-ping malls. Senior centers offer exercise classes rangingfrom line dancing to belly dancing.\\nCosts for exercise range from the price of walking\\nshoes to the fees for joining a gym.\\nOsteoporosis\\nPrevention is the best method of treating osteoporo-\\nsis. Methods of preventing osteoporosis include regularweight-bearing exercise such as walking, jogging, weightlifting, yoga , and stair climbing.\\nPeople should not smoke since smoking makes the\\nbody produce less estrogen. Care should be taken toavoid falling.\\nDiet should include from 1,000–1,300 mg. of calci-\\num each day. Sources of calcium include:\\n• leafy, dark-green vegetables such as spinach, kale, mus-\\ntard greens, and turnip greens\\n• low-fat dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and\\ncheeses such as cheddar, Swiss, mozzarella, and parme-san; also helpful are foods made with milk such as pud-ding and soup\\n• canned fish such as salmon, sardine, and anchovies• tortillas made from lime-processed corn• tofu processed with calcium-sulfate• calcium tablets\\nMEDICAL TREATMENT. An x ray will indicate bone\\nloss when much of the density has decreased. A moreeffective way of detecting osteoporosis is the DEXA-scan(dual-energy x-ray absorbtiometry). This whole-body scanwill indicate whether a person is at risk for fractures. Itcould be useful for people at risk for osteoporosis as wellas women near the age of menopause or older. Peopleshould ask their doctors about whether this test is needed.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2998Seniors’ healthGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 2998'),\n",

In addition to restoring estrogen, HRT\\ncould reduce the risk of colon cancer and Alzheimer’sdisease. However, more research is needed in these areas.\\nOsteoarthritis\\nTreatments for osteoarthritis range from preventative\\nmeasures such as walking to joint replacement surgery.\\nTreatment costs vary from no cost for soaking a joint incold water, the price of over-the-counter remedies, tofees for surgery.\\nPreventive and maintenance remedies include low-\\nimpact exercise such as swimming and walking, alongwith maintaining proper posture. Nutritional aids includefoods rich in vitamin C such as citrus fruits and broccoli.Also recommended is daily consumption of 400 interna-tional units of Vitamin E. A person should cut back onfats, sugar, salt, cholesterol, and alcohol.\\nHOME REMEDIES AND PHYSICAL THERAPY. The\\nArthritis Foundation recommends several remedies foreasing pain. To treat inflammation, a person should use acold treatment for 20 minutes. Methods include soakingthe affected area in cold water or applying an ice pack.To soothe aches and stimulate circulation, a personapplies heat to the affected area for 20 minutes. Thisshould be done three times during the day.\\nOver-the-counter (OTC) remedies such as aspirin\\nand ibuprofen and salves containing capsaicin can behelpful. Furthermore, a doctor may recommend anti-inflammatory medications.\\nSURGICAL TREATMENT. If osteoarthritis is suspected,\\na doctor’s diagnosis will include an assessment ofwhether joint pain is part of a patient’s medical history.The doctor may take an x ray to determine the presenceof cartilage loss and how much degeneration occurred.\\nAcupuncture may be helpful in treating mild\\nosteoarthritis. Generally, a person should have one to twotreatments a week for several weeks. Afterward, onetreatment is recommended. An assessment of resultsshould be made after 10 treatments.\\nIn cases of severe osteoarthritis, joint replacement\\nsurgery or joint immobilization may be required. Joints\\nare replaced with metal, plastic, or ceramic material.\\nFall prevention\\nFall prevention starts with regular exercise such as\\nwalking. This improves balance and muscles. The walkroute should be on level ground. Other methods for pre-\\nventing falls include:\\n• when rising from a chair or bed, a senior should move\\nslowly to avoid dizziness\\n• shoes with low-heels and rubber soles are recommend-\\ned\\n• medications should be monitored because of side\\neffects that increase the probability of a fall\\n• vision and hearing should be checked periodically\\n• fall-proofing the home, including the installation of\\nlighting, especially stairways, clearing up clutter andelectrical cords that can cause falls, and the installationhandrails and strips in bathtubs and rails on stairs.\\nMEDICAL TREATMENT FOR FALLS. After a fall, a\\nsenior may need First Aid treatment for cuts or fractures.The doctor may evaluate whether medications cause bal-ance problems. If indicated, the doctor may examine thepatient’s central nervous system function, balance, andmuscle/joint function. A hearing or vision test may beordered.\\nCorrective measures could include adjusting pre-\\nscriptions, vision surgery or having the patient use a caneor walker.\\nVision\\nA person diagnosed with presbyopia may need bifo-\\ncals or reading glasses to read print that appears toosmall. These lenses may need to be changed as visionchanges over the years. Eventually, a person relies onglasses to focus on items that are near. Other seniors whonever needed corrective lenses may need to wear eye-glasses. Publishers aware of this condition producebooks with large print.\\nA senior should schedule periodic vision exams\\nbecause early treatment helps prevent or lessen a risk ofcataracts or glaucoma.

A senior can startan exercise program, take up hobbies, take classes, orvolunteer. Senior centers offer numerous activities.Lunch programs provide nutritional meals and compan-ionship. This is important because a senior living alonemay not feel motivated to prepare healthy meals.\\nDementia\\nDiagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease starts with a thor-\\nough medical examination. The doctor should administermemory tests. Blood tests may be required, as well as aCT scan or MRI scan of the brain. If Alzheimer’s is diag-nosed, the doctor may prescribe medication to slowdown progression of this form of dementia.\\nAs of 2001, the FDA had approved four prescription\\nmedications for treatment of Alzheimer’s. Tacrine,donepezil, riviastigmine, and galantamine are choline-sterase inhibitors that enhance memory. Modest im-provement was reported in clinical trials on donepezil,riviastigmine, and galantamine. Tacrine’s possible sideeffects include liver damage, so it is seldom prescribed.\\nPreparation\\nBefore beginning a weight loss or exercise program,\\nseniors should check with their doctors. The doctor willdetermine whether a patient is at a healthy weight, or\\nneeds to gain or lose weight. The medical professionalshould be informed about a health condition or a familyhistory of a condition like heart disease. The doctor mayorder a physical exam or recommend a specific exerciseprogram.\\nExercise preparation\\nA senior should select a form of exercise enjoyable\\nenough to become a regular routine. Suitable clothing orequipment such as walking shoes or a bicycle helmetshould be purchased. If a person is active for more than ahalf-hour, the American Heart Association recommendsdrinking water every 15 minutes.\\nIn addition to packing a water bottle, a person\\nshould pick an exercise buddy. Exercising with a friendor a group makes the activity more enjoyable. In addi-tion, a person is more apt to stick with a routine if abuddy is involved.\\nBefore exercising, the person should warm-up with\\nslow stretching exercises. This could take longer for asenior because muscular elasticity slows down as a per-son ages. The exercise session should end with a cool-down that includes slow stretches.\\nAftercare\\nSome recovery time may be needed after surgery.\\nHowever, a healthy person will heal more quickly. Asenior needs to maintain a schedule of regular exercise inorder to remain mobile. Otherwise, a minor illness couldmake them dependent on others for daily care, accordingto the American Heart Association.\\nIf mobility becomes limited due to a condition like\\nosteoarthritis, equipment like a walker and devices thatmake it easier to open bottles and grip cutlery can behelpful.\\nRisks\\nExercising too long or too strenuously can be physi-\\ncally harmful. The over-exertion could cause the personto lose interest in exercise and put off establishing a regu-lar routine. A person should start out slowly and build upto more intense or longer sessions. This is particularlyimportant for a sedentary person.\\nOsteoporosis\\nThe longterm effects of hormone replacement thera-\\npy are not known.

These sensory systems areresponsible for detecting sights, sounds, smell, tastes, tem-peratures, pain , and the position and movements of the\\nbody. The brain then forms a combined picture of thisinformation in order for the body to make sense of its sur-roundings and react to them appropriately. The ongoingrelationship between behavior and brain functioning iscalled sensory integration (SI), a theory that was first pio-neered by A. Jean Ayres, Ph.D., OTR in the 1960s.\\nDescription\\nSensory experiences include touch, movement, body\\nawareness, sight, sound, smell, taste, and the pull ofgravity. Distinguishing between these is the process ofsensory integration (SI). While the process of SI occursautomatically and without effort for most, for some theprocess is inefficient. Extensive effort and attention arerequired in these individuals for SI to occur, without aguarantee of it being accomplished. When this happens,goals are not easily completed, resulting in sensory inte-gration disorder (SID).\\nThe normal process of SI begins before birth and\\ncontinues throughout life, with the majority of SI devel-opment occurring before the early teenage years. Theability for SI to become more refined and effective coin-cides with the aging process as it determines how well\\nmotor and speech skills and emotional stability develop.The beginnings of the SI theory by Ayres instigated ongo-ing research that looks at the crucial foundation it pro-vides for complex learning and behavior throughout life.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe presence of a sensory integration disorder is\\ntypically detected in young children. While most chil-dren develop SI during the course of ordinary childhoodactivities, which helps establish such things as the abilityfor motor planning and adapting to incoming sensations,others SI ability does not develop as efficiently. Whentheir process is disordered, a variety of problems inlearning, development, or behavior become obvious.Those who have sensory integration dysfunction\\nmay be unable to respond to certain sensory informationby planning and organizing what needs to be done in anappropriate and automatic manner. This may cause aprimitive survival technique called “fright, flight, andfight,” or withdrawal response, which originates from the“primitive” brain. This response often appears extremeand inappropriate for the particular situation.\\nThe neurological disorganization resulting in SID\\noccurs in three different ways: the brain does not receivemessages due to a disconnection in the neuron cells; sen-sory messages are received inconsistently; or sensorymessages are received consistently, but do not connectproperly with other sensory messages. When the brainpoorly processes sensory messages, inefficient motor,language, or emotional output is the result.\\nAccording to Sensory Integration International (SII),\\na non-profit corporation concerned with the impact of sen-sory integrative problems on people’s lives, the followingare some signs of sensory integration disorder (SID):\\n• oversensitivity to touch, movement, sights, or sounds\\n• underreactivity to touch, movement, sights, or sounds• tendency to be easily distracted• social and/or emotional problems• activity level that is unusually high or unusually low\\n• physical clumsiness or apparent carelessness\\n• impulsive, lacking in self-control• difficulty in making transitions from one situation to\\nanother\\n• inability to unwind or calm self\\n• poor self concept\\n• delays in speech, language, or motor skills• delays in academic achievement\\nWhile research indicates that sensory integrative\\nproblems are found in up to 70% of children who are con-sidered learning disabled by schools, the problems of sen-sory integration are not confined to children with learningdisabilities. SID transfers through all age groups, as wellas intellectual levels and socioeconomic groups. Factorsthat contribute to SID include: premature birth; autism\\nand other developmental disorders; learning disabilities;delinquency and substance abuse due to learning disabili-ties; stress-related disorders; and brain injury. Two of thebiggest contributing conditions are autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ).\\nDiagnosis\\nIn order to determine the presence of SID, an evalua-\\ntion may be conducted by a qualified occupational or\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3002Sensory integration disorderGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3002'),\n",

An evaluation normally consists of\\nboth standardized testing and structured observations ofresponses to sensory stimulation, posture, balance, coor-dination, and eye movements. These test results andassessment data, along with information from other pro-fessionals and parents, are carefully analyzed by the ther-apist who then makes recommendations about appropri-ate treatment.\\nTreatment\\nOccupational therapists play a key role in the con-\\nventional treatment of SID. By providing sensory inte-gration therapy, occupational therapists are able to sup-ply the vital sensory input and experiences that childrenwith SID need to grow and learn. Also referred to as a“sensory diet,” this type of therapy involves a plannedand scheduled activity program implemented by an occu-pational therapist, with each “diet” being designed anddeveloped to meet the needs of the child’s nervous sys-tem. A sensory diet stimulates the “near” senses (tactile,vestibular, and proprioceptive) with a combination ofalerting, organizing, and calming techniques.\\nMotor skills training methods that normally consist\\nof adaptive physical education, movement education, andgymnastics are often used by occupational and physicaltherapists. While these are important skills to work on,the sensory integrative approach is vital to treating SID.\\nThe sensory integrative approach is guided by one\\nimportant aspect—the child’s motivation in selection ofthe activities. By allowing them to be actively involved,and explore activities that provide sensory experiencesmost beneficial to them, children become more matureand efficient at organizing sensory information.\\nAlternative treatment\\nSensory integration disorder (SID) is treatable with\\noccupational therapy, but some alternative methods areemerging to complement the conventional methods usedfor SID.\\nTherapeutic body brushing is often used on children\\n(not infants) who overreact to tactile stimulation. A specif-ic non-scratching surgical brush is used to make firm,brisk movements over most of the body, especially thearms, legs, hands, back and soles of the feet. A techniqueof deep joint compression follows the brushing. Usuallybegun by an occupational therapist, the technique is taughtto parents who need to complete the process for three tofive minutes, six to eight times a day. The time needed forbrushing is reduced as the child begins to respond morenormally to touch. In order for this therapy to be effective,the correct brush and technique must be used.KEY TERMS\\nAxon —A process of a neuron that conducts\\nimpulses away from the cell body.

CES is a modification of TranscutaneousElectrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) technology that\\nhas been used to treat adults with various pain problems,including arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome . TENS\\ntherapy uses a low voltage signal applied to the bodythrough the skin with the goal of replacing painfulimpressions with a massage-like sensation. A muchlower signal is used for CES than that used for traditionalTENS, and the electrodes are placed on the scalp or ears.Occupational therapists who have studied the use of CESsuggest that CES for children with SID can result inimproved brain activity. The device is worn by childrenat home for 10 minutes at a time, twice per day.\\nMusic therapy helps promote active listening.

This is a very broad term cover-ing the presence of many types of microscopic disease-causing organisms.\\nDescription\\nSepsis is also called bacteremia . Closely related\\nterms include septicemia and septic syndrome. In thegeneral population, the incidence of sepsis is two peoplein 10,000.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSepsis can originate anywhere bacteria can gain\\nentry to the body; common sites include the genitouri-nary tract, the liver and its bile ducts, the gastrointestinaltract, and the lungs. Broken or ulcerated skin can alsoprovide access to bacteria commonly present in the envi-ronment. Invasive medical procedures, including dentalwork, can introduce bacteria or permit it to accumulate.Entry points and equipment left in place for any length oftime present a particular risk. Heart valve replacement ,\\ncatheters, ostomy sites, intravenous (IV) or arterial lines,\\nsurgical wounds , or surgical drains are examples. IV\\ndrug users are at high risk as well.People with inefficient immune systems or blood\\ndisorders are at particular risk for sepsis and have a high-er death rate (up to 60%); in people who have no under-\\nlying chronic disease, the death rate is far lower (about5%). The growing problem of antibiotic resistance hasincreased the incidence of sepsis, partly because ordinarypreventive measures (such as prophylactic antibiotics )\\nare less effective.\\nThe most common symptom of sepsis is fever , often\\naccompanied by chills or shaking, or other flu-like symp-toms. A history of any recent invasive procedure or den-tal work should raise the suspicion of sepsis and medicalhelp should be sought.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe presence of sepsis is indicated by blood tests\\nshowing particularly high or low white blood cell counts.The causative agent is determined by blood culture .\\nTreatment\\nIdentifying the specific causative agent ultimately\\ndetermines how sepsis is treated. However, time is of theessence, so a broad-spectrum antibiotic or multipleantibiotics will be administered until blood culturesreveal the culprit and treatment can be made specific tothe organism. Intravenous antibiotic therapy is usuallynecessary and is administered in the hospital.\\nSepsis syndrome seeSeptic shock\\nSeptal deviation seeDeviated septum\\nSeptic arthritis seeInfectious arthritis\\nJill S.

Toxic shock syndrome is one type of\\nseptic shock.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nDuring an infection, certain types of bacteria can pro-\\nduce and release complex molecules, called endotoxins,that may provoke a dramatic response by the body’simmune system. Released in the bloodstream, endotoxinsare particularly dangerous, because they become widelydispersed and affect the blood vessels themselves. Arteriesand the smaller arterioles open wider, increasing the totalvolume of the circulatory system. At the same time, thewalls of the blood vessels become leaky, allowing fluid toseep out into the tissues, lowering the amount of fluid leftin circulation. This combination of increased system vol-ume and decreased fluid causes a dramatic decrease inblood pressure and reduces the blood flow to the organs.Other changes brought on by immune response may causecoagulation of the blood in the extremities, which can fur-ther decrease circulation through the organs.\\nSeptic shock is seen most often in patients with sup-\\npressed immune systems, and is usually due to bacteriaacquired during treatment at the hospital. The immunesystem is suppressed by drugs used to treat cancer ,\\nautoimmune disorders , organ transplants, and diseases\\nof immune deficiency such as AIDS . Malnutrition ,\\nchronic drug abuse, and long-term illness increase thelikelihood of succumbing to bacterial infection. Bac-teremia is more likely with preexisting infections such asurinary or gastrointestinal tract infections, or skin ulcers.Bacteria may be introduced to the blood stream by surgi-cal procedures, catheters, or intravenous equipment.\\nToxic shock syndrome most often occurs in men-\\nstruating women using highly absorbent tampons. Left inplace longer than other types, these tampons provide thebreeding ground for Staphylococcus bacteria, which may\\nthen enter the bloodstream through small tears in thevaginal lining. The incidence of toxic shock syndromehas declined markedly since this type of tampon waswithdrawn from the market.\\nSymptoms\\nSeptic shock is usually preceded by bacteremia,\\nwhich is marked by fever , malaise, chills, and nausea.\\nThe first sign of shock is often confusion and decreasedconsciousness. In this beginning stage, the extremitiesare usually warm. Later, they become cool, pale, andbluish. Fever may give way to lower-than-normal tem-peratures later on in sepsis .\\nOther symptoms include:• rapid heartbeat\\n• shallow, rapid breathing\\n• decreased urination.\\n• reddish patches in the skin\\nSeptic shock may progress to cause “adult respiratory\\ndistress syndrome,” in which fluid collects in the lungs, andbreathing becomes very shallow and labored. This condi-tion may lead to ventilatory collapse, in which the patientcan no longer breathe adequately without assistance.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of septic shock is made by measuring\\nblood pressure, heart rate, and respiration rate, as well asby a consideration of possible sources of infection.Blood pressure may be monitored with a catheter deviceinserted into the pulmonary artery supplying the lungs(Swan-Ganz catheter). Blood cultures are done to deter-mine the type of bacteria responsible. The levels of oxy-gen, carbon dioxide, and acidity in the blood are alsomonitored to assess changes in respiratory function.\\nTreatment\\nSeptic shock is treated initially with a combination\\nof antibiotics and fluid replacement. The antibiotic is\\nchosen based on the bacteria present, although two ormore types of antibiotics may be used initially until theorganism is identified. Intravenous fluids, either blood orprotein solutions, replace the fluid lost by leakage. Coag-ulation and hemorrhage may be treated with transfusionsof plasma or platelets. Dopamine may be given toincrease blood pressure further if necessary.\\nRespiratory distress is treated with mechanical ven-\\ntilation and supplemental oxygen, either using a nose-piece or a tube into the trachea through the throat.\\nIdentification and treatment of the primary infection\\nsite is important to prevent ongoing proliferation of bac-teria.\\nPrognosis\\nSeptic shock is most likely to develop in the hospi-\\ntal, since it follows infections which are likely to be theobjects of treatment. Because of this, careful monitoringand early, aggressive therapy can minimize the likeli-hood of progression. Nonetheless, death occurs in at least25% of all cases.\\nThe likelihood of recovery from septic shock\\ndepends on may factors, including the degree of immuno-suppression of the patient, underlying disease, prompt-ness of treatment, and type of bacteria responsible.

The nasal septum is the sep-aration between the two nostrils. In adults, the septum iscomposed partly of cartilage and partly of bone.\\nPurpose\\nSeptoplasty is performed to correct a crooked (devi-\\nated) or dislocated septum, often as part of plastic surgeryof the nose ( rhinoplasty ). The nasal septum has three\\nfunctions: to support the nose, regulate air flow, and sup-port the mucous membranes (mucosa) of the nose. Septo-plasty is done to correct the shape of the nose caused by adeformed septum or correct deregulated air flow causedby a deviated septum . Septoplasty is often needed when\\nthe patient is having an operation to reduce the size of thenose (reductive rhinoplasty), because this operation usu-ally reduces the amount of breathing space in the nose.KEY TERMS\\nBacteremia —Invasion of the bloodstream by bac-\\nteria.Precautions\\nSeptoplasty is ordinarily not performed within six\\nmonths of a traumatic injury to the nose.\\nDescription\\nSeptoplasties are performed in the hospital with a\\ncombination of local and intravenous anesthesia. Afterthe patient is anesthetized, the surgeon makes a cut (inci-sion) in the mucous tissue that covers the part of the sep-tum that is made of cartilage. The tissue is lifted, expos-ing the cartilage and bony part of the septum. Usually,one side of the mucous tissue is left intact to provide sup-port during healing. Cartilage is cut away as needed.\\nAs the surgeon cuts away the cartilage, deformities\\ntend to straighten themselves out, reducing the amount ofcartilage that must be cut. Once the cartilage is cut, bonydeformities can be corrected. For most patients, this is theextent of the surgery required to improve breathing throughthe nose and correct deformities. Some patients have bonyobstructions at the base of the nasal chamber and requirefurther surgery. These obstructions include bony spurs andridges that contribute to drying, ulceration, or bleeding ofthe mucous tissue that covers the inside of the nasal pas-sages. In these cases, the extent of the surgery depends onthe nature of the deformities that need correcting.\\nDuring surgery, the patient’s own cartilage that has\\nbeen removed can be reused to provide support for the noseif needed. External septum supports are not usually needed.Splints may be needed occasionally to support cartilagewhen extensive cutting has been done. External splints canbe used to support the cartilage for the first few days ofhealing. Tefla gauze is inserted in the nostril to support theflaps and cartilage and to absorb any bleeding or mucus.\\nPreparation\\nBefore performing a septoplasty, the surgeon will\\nevaluate the difference in airflow between the two nos-trils. In children, this assessment can be done very sim-ply by asking the child to breathe out slowly on a smallmirror held in front of the nose.\\nAs with any other operation under general anesthe-\\nsia, patients are evaluated for any physical conditionsthat might complicate surgery and for any medicationsthat might affect blood clotting time.\\nAftercare\\nPatients with septoplasties are usually sent home\\nfrom the hospital later the same day or the morning afterthe surgery. All dressings inside the nose are removedbefore the patient leaves.

The operation in itself, however, is relatively low-risk in that it does not involve major blood vessels orvital organs.

The patient’s immune system recognizes the pro-teins in the drug or antiserum as foreign proteins, andproduces its own antibodies to protect against the foreignproteins. The newly formed antibodies bind with the for-eign protein to form immune complexes. These immunecomplexes may enter the walls of blood vessels wherethey set off an inflammatory reaction.\\nWhile other types of allergic reactions may produce\\na rapid response, the serum sickness reaction is delayedbecause it takes time for the body to produce antibodiesto the new protein.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe usual symptoms are severe skin reactions, often\\non the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Fever ,\\nsometimes as high as 104°F, is always present and usual-ly appears before the skin rash.\\nJoint pain may be reported in up to 50% of cases.\\nThis is usually seen in the larger joints, but occasionallythe finger and toe joints may also be involved.\\nSwelling of lymph nodes, particularly around the\\nsite of the injection, is seen in 10–20% of cases.

These may include changes in vision, anddifficulty in movement. Breathing difficulty may occur.\\nTraditionally, antitoxins were the most common\\ncause of serum sickness, but those reports date from atime when most antitoxins were made from horse serum.As many as 16% of the people who received antirabiesserum derived from horses developed serum sickness.The risk of a reaction to antitoxins has dropped dramati-cally since manufacturers have started using humanserum instead of horse serum to make their products.\\nAlthough antitoxins are the most common cause of\\nserum sickness, a number of drugs have been reported tocause a serum sickness reaction. The following list is notcomplete, but indicates some of the drugs that have beenassociated with this type of reaction:\\n• allopurinol (Zyloprim)\\n• barbiturates• captopril (Capoten)• cephalosporin antibiotics• griseofulvin (Fulvicin, Grifulvin)\\n• penicillins\\n• pehnytoin (Dilantin)• procainamide (Procan SR, Procanbid, Pronestyl-SR)• quinidine (Quinaglute, Quinidex, Quinora)\\n• streptokinase (Streptase, Kabikinase)\\n• sulfonamide antibacterial drugs\\nOf cases of serum sickness reported to the United\\nStates Food and Drug Administration, the drugs mostcommonly associated with the reaction have been thecephalosporin antibiotics, including cefaclor (Ceclor)and cefalexin (Keflex) and the sulfonamide combinationtrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra.) Thisdoes not mean that these are high-risk drugs, since thesedrugs are very widely used, so that there are many peopleexposed to them.\\nIn addition to these substances, allergenic extracts\\nused for testing and immunization, hormones, and vac-cines have been known to cause serum sickness.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made by observing the symptoms and\\nreviewing the patient’s medical and medication history.Although the symptoms of serum sickness may be similarto other conditions, patients who present with symptomsof serum sickness and who have a recent history of expo-sure to a drug or other product which may cause this typeof reaction should be suspected of having serum sickness.Treatment\\nThe first step in treatment of serum sickness is\\nalways to discontinue the drug or other substance whichis suspected of causing the reaction. After that, all treat-ment is symptomatic. Antihistamines , pain relievers,\\nand corticosteroids may be given to relieve the symp-\\ntoms. The choice of treatment depends on the severity ofthe reaction.\\nPrognosis\\nMost serum sickness reactions are mild, and disap-\\npear on their own after one or two weeks as long as thecause is removed. Sometimes, symptoms of pain and dis-comfort may continue for several weeks, even after allthe observable reactions such as skin rash and protein inthe urine have disappeared. In very rare cases, however,there can be severe reactions and permanent damage. Invery rare but extreme cases, serum sickness can lead toshock , permanent kidney damage, and even death .\\nPrevention\\nThe most effective method of prevention is simple\\navoidance of antitoxins that may cause serum sickness.If patients have had a reaction in the past, particularly ifthe reaction was to a commonly used drug, they shouldbe made aware of it, and be advised to alert physiciansand hospitals in the future. Patients who have had par-ticularly severe reactions may be advised to wear iden-tification bracelets, or use other means to alert healthcare providers.\\nWhen it is necessary to administer an antitoxin, skin\\ntests may be used to identify people who are at risk of areaction. If the situation does not allow enough time forskin testing, the antitoxin should be given along with anintravenous antihistamine.

Sev-eral different immune system disorders are currentlygrouped under SCID:\\n• Swiss-type agammaglobulinemia. This was the first\\ntype of SCID discovered, in Switzerland in the 1950s.\\n• Adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA). About 50% of\\nSCID cases are of this type. ADA deficiency leads to lowlevels of B and T cells in the child’s immune system.\\n• Autosomal recessive. About 40% of SCID cases are\\ninherited from the parents in an autosomal recessivepattern.\\n• Bare lymphocyte syndrome. In this form of SCID, the\\nwhite blood cells (lymphocytes) in the baby’s blood aremissing certain proteins. Without these proteins, thelymphocytes cannot activate the T cells in the immunesystem.\\n• SCID with leukopenia. Children with this form of\\nSCID are lacking a type of white blood cell called agranulocyte.\\nIn order to understand why SCID is considered the\\nmost severe immunodeficiency disorder, it is helpful tohave an outline of the parts of the human immune sys-tem. It has three parts: cellular, humoral, and nonspecific.The cellular and humoral parts of the system are bothneeded to fight infections—they recognize diseaseagents and attack them. The cellular system is composedof many classes of T-lymphocytes (white blood cells thatdetect foreign invaders called antigens). The humoralsystem is made up of B cells, which are the only cells inthe body that make antibodies. In SCID, neither the cel-lular nor the humoral part of the immune system is work-ing properly.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSCID is an inherited disorder. There are two ways in\\nwhich a developing fetus’ immune system can fail todevelop normally. In the first type of genetic problem,both B and T cells are defective. In the second type, onlythe T cells are abnormal, but their defect affects the func-tioning of the B cells.\\nFor the first few months of life, a child with SCID is\\nprotected by antibodies in the mother’s blood.

Frey\\nSex change surgery\\nDefinition\\nAlso known as sex reassignment surgery, sex change\\nsurgery is a procedure that changes genital organs fromone gender to another.\\nPurpose\\nThere are two reasons to alter the genital organs\\nfrom one sex to another.\\n• Newborns with intersex deformities must early on be\\nassigned one sex or the other. These deformities repre-sent intermediate stages between the primordial femalegenitals and the change into male caused by male hor-mone stimulation.\\n• Both men and women occasionally believe they are\\nphysically a different sex than they are mentally andemotionally. This dissonance is so profound they arewilling to be surgically altered.\\nIn both cases, technical considerations favor suc-\\ncessful conversion to a female rather than a male. New-borns with ambiguous organs will almost always beassigned to the female sex, unless the penis is at least aninch long. Whatever their chromosomes, they are muchmore likely to be socially well adjusted as females, evenif they cannot have children.\\nPrecautions\\nSexual identity is probably the most profound char-\\nacteristic humans have. Assigning it must take placeimmediately after birth, both for the child’s and the par-ents’ comfort. Changing sexual identity may be the mostsignificant change one can experience. It therefore shouldbe done with every care and caution. By the time mostadults come to surgery, they have lived for many yearswith dissonant identity. The average in one study was 29years. Nevertheless, even then they may not be fullyaware of the implications of becoming the other sex.Description\\nConverting male to female anatomy requires\\nremoval of the penis, reshaping genital tissue to appearmore female, and constructing a vagina. A vagina can besuccessfully formed from a skin graft or an isolated loopof intestine. Following the surgery, female hormones(estrogen) will reshape the body’s contours and grow sat-isfactory breasts.\\nFemale to male surgery has achieved lesser success,\\ndue to the difficulty of building a functioning penis fromthe much smaller clitoral tissue available in the femalegenitals. Penis construction is not attempted less than ayear after the preliminary surgery to remove the femaleorgans. One study in Singapore found that a third of thepatients would not undergo the surgery again. Neverthe-less, they were all pleased with the change of sex.Besides the genital organs, the breasts need to be surgi-cally altered for a more male appearance. This can bedone quite successfully.\\nOrgasm, or at least “a reasonable degree of erogenous\\nsensitivity,” can be experienced by patients after surgery.\\nPreparation\\nIn-depth psychological counseling should precede\\nand follow these procedures.\\nAftercare\\nSocial support, particularly from the family, is\\nimportant for readjustment as a member of the oppositesex. If patients were socially or emotionally unstablebefore the operation, over 30, or had an unsuitable bodybuild for the new sex, they tend to do poorly. In no casestudied did the procedure diminish their ability to work.\\nRisks\\nAll surgery runs the risk of infection, bleeding, and a\\nneed to return for repairs. This surgery is irreversible, sothe patient must have no doubts about the results.\\nThe most common complication of the male to\\nfemale surgery is narrowing of the new vagina.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHensle, Terry W., and William A.

E1, a type of estrogen, is the most activeestrogen in the nonpregnant female.\\nE3 (estriol) is the major estrogen in the pregnant\\nfemale. It is produced in the placenta. Excretion of estriolincreases around the eighth week of gestation and contin-ues to rise until shortly before delivery. Serial urine andblood studies of this hormone are used to assess placentalfunction and fetal normality in high-risk pregnancies.Falling values during pregnancy suggest fetoplacentaldeterioration and require prompt reassessment of thepregnancy, including the possibility of early delivery.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3012Sex hormones testsGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3012'),\n",

Therapy isslow and requires open communication and understand-ing between sexual partners. Therapy may inadvertentlyaddress interpersonal communication problems.\\nDescription\\nSex therapy is conducted by a trained therapist, doc-\\ntor, or psychologist. The initial sessions should cover acomplete history not only of the sexual problem but of theentire relationship and each individual’s background andpersonality. The sexual relationship should be discussedin the context of the entire relationship. In fact, sexualcounseling may de-emphasize sex until other aspects ofthe relationship are better understood and communicated.\\nThere are several techniques that combat sexual dys-\\nfunction and are used in sex therapy. They include:\\n• Semans’ technique, which is used to help combat pre-\\nmature ejaculation with a “start-stop” approach to penisstimulation. By stimulating the man up to the point ofejaculation and then stopping, the man will becomemore aware of his response. More awareness leads togreater control, and open stimulation of both partnersleads to greater communication and less anxiety. Thestart-stop technique is conducted four times until theman is allowed to ejaculate.\\n• Sensate focus therapy, the practice of nongenital and\\ngenital touching between partners in order to decreasesexual anxiety and build communication. First, partnersexplore each other’s bodies without touching the geni-tals or breasts. Once the couple is comfortable withnongenital touching, they can expand to genital stimu-lation. Intercourse is prohibited in order to allow thepartners to expand their intimacy and communication.\\n• Squeeze technique, which is used to treat premature\\nejaculation. When the man feels the urge to ejaculate, hispartner squeezes his penis just below the head. This stopsejaculation and gives the man more control over hisresponse.\\nAftercare\\nHabits change slowly. All the techniques must be\\npracticed faithfully for long periods of time to relearnbehaviors. Communication is imperative.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nMasters, William H., Virginia E.

Specifically, sexualdysfunctions are disorders that interfere with a full sexu-al response cycle. These disorders make it difficult for aperson to enjoy or to have sexual intercourse. While sex-ual dysfunction rarely threatens physical health, it cantake a heavy psychological toll, bringing on depression,anxiety , and debilitating feelings of inadequacy.\\nDescription\\nSexual dysfunction takes different forms in men and\\nwomen. A dysfunction can be life-long and always present,acquired, situational, or generalized, occurring despite thesituation. A man may have a sexual problem if he:\\n• ejaculates before he or his partner desires\\n• does not ejaculate, or experiences delayed ejaculation\\n• is unable to have an erection sufficient for pleasurable\\nintercourse\\n• feels pain during intercourse\\n• lacks or loses sexual desire\\nA woman may have a sexual problem if she:\\n• lacks or loses sexual desire\\n• has difficulty achieving orgasm• feels anxiety during intercourse\\n• feels pain during intercourse\\n• feels vaginal or other muscles contract involuntarily\\nbefore or during sex\\n• has inadequate lubrication\\nThe most common sexual dysfunctions in men include:\\n• Erectile dysfunction: an impairment of the erectile\\nreflex. The man is unable to have or maintain an erec-tion that is firm enough for coitus or intercourse.\\n•Premature ejaculation : rapid ejaculation with mini-\\nmal sexual stimulation before, on, or shortly after pene-tration and before the person wishes it.• Ejaculatory incompetence: the inability to ejaculate\\nwithin the vagina despite a firm erection and relativelyhigh levels of sexual arousal.\\n• Retarded ejaculation: a condition in which the bladder\\nneck does not close off properly during orgasm so thatthe semen spurts backward into the bladder.\\nUntil recently, it was presumed that women were\\nless sexual than men. In the past two decades, traditionalviews of female sexuality were all but demolished, andwomen’s sexual needs became accepted as legitimate intheir own right.\\nFemale sexual dysfunctions include:\\n• Sexual arousal disorder: the inhibition of the general\\narousal aspect of sexual response. A woman with thisdisorder does not lubricate, her vagina does not swell,and the muscle that surrounds the outer third of thevagina does not tighten—a series of changes that nor-mally prepare the body for orgasm (“the orgasmic plat-form”). Also, in this disorder, the woman typically doesnot feel erotic sensations.\\n• Orgasmic disorder: the impairment of the orgasmic\\ncomponent of the female sexual response. The womanmay be sexually aroused but never reach orgasm.Orgasmic capacity is less than would be reasonable forher age, sexual experience, and the adequacy of sexualstimulation she receives.\\n• Vaginismus: a condition in which the muscles around\\nthe outer third of the vagina have involuntary spasms inresponse to attempts at vaginal penetration.\\n• Painful intercourse: a condition that can occur at any\\nage. Pain can appear at the start of intercourse, midwaythrough coital activities, at the time of orgasm, or afterintercourse is completed. The pain can be felt as burn-ing, sharp searing, or cramping; it can be external, with-in the vagina, or deep in the pelvic region or abdomen.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMany factors, of both physical and psychological\\nnatures, can affect sexual response and performance.Injuries, ailments, and drugs are among the physicalinfluences; in addition, there is increasing evidence thatchemicals and other environmental pollutants depresssexual function. As for psychological factors, sexual dys-function may have roots in traumatic events such as rapeor incest, guilt feelings, a poor self-image, depression,chronic fatigue , certain religious beliefs, or marital prob-\\nlems. Dysfunction is often associated with anxiety. If aman operates under the misconception that all sexualactivity must lead to intercourse and to orgasm by hispartner, and if the expectation is not met, he may consid-er the act a failure.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3015Sexual dysfunctionGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3015'),\n",

Possible\\npsychological causes include anxiety (mainly perfor-mance anxiety), guilt feelings about sex, and ambivalencetoward women. However, research has failed to show adirect link between premature ejaculation and anxiety.Rather, premature ejaculation seems more related to sexu-al inexperience in learning to modulate arousal.\\nWhen men experience painful intercourse, the cause\\nis usually physical; an infection of the prostate, urethra, ortestes, or an allergic reaction to spermicide or condoms.Painful erections may be caused by Peyronie’s disease ,\\nfibrous plaques on the upper side of the penis that oftenproduce a bend during erection. Cancer of the penis or\\ntestes and arthritis of the lower back can also cause pain.\\nRetrograde ejaculation occurs in men who have had\\nprostate or urethral surgery, take medication that keepsthe bladder open, or suffer from diabetes, a disease thatcan injure the nerves that normally close the bladder dur-ing ejaculation.\\nErectile dysfunction is more likely than other dys-\\nfunctions to have a physical cause. Drugs, diabetes (themost common physical cause), Parkinson’s disease ,\\nmultiple sclerosis , and spinal cord lesions can all be\\ncauses of erectile dysfunction. When physical causes areruled out, anxiety is the most likely psychological causeof erectile dysfunction.\\nWomen\\nDysfunctions of arousal and orgasm in women also\\nmay be physical or psychological in origin. Among themost common causes are day-to-day discord with one’spartner and inadequate stimulation by the partner. Final-ly, sexual desire can wane as one ages, although thisvaries greatly from person to person.\\nPain during intercourse can occur for any number of\\nreasons, and location is sometimes a clue to the cause.Pain in the vaginal area may be due to infection, such asurethritis; also, vaginal tissues may become thinner andmore sensitive during breast-feeding and aftermenopause . Deeper pain may have a pelvic source, such\\nas endometriosis , pelvic adhesions, or uterine abnormal-\\nities. Pain can also have a psychological cause, such asfear of injury, guilt feelings about sex, fear of pregnancy\\nor injury to the fetus during pregnancy, or recollection ofa previous painful experience.\\nVaginismus may be provoked by these psychologi-\\ncal causes as well, or it may begin as a response to pain,and continue after the pain is gone. Both partners shouldunderstand that the vaginal contraction is an involuntary\\nresponse, outside the woman’s control.\\nSimilarly, insufficient lubrication is involuntary, and\\nmay be part of a complex cycle. Low sexual responsemay lead to inadequate lubrication, which may lead todiscomfort, and so on.\\nDiagnosis\\nIn deciding when a sexual dysfunction is present, it is\\nnecessary to remember that while some people may beinterested in sex at almost any time, others have low orseemingly nonexistent levels of sexual interest. Only whenit is a source of personal or relationship distress, instead ofvoluntary choice, is it classified as a sexual dysfunction.\\nThe first step in diagnosing a sexual dysfunction is usu-\\nally discussing the problem with a doctor, who will need toask further questions in an attempt to differentiate amongthe types of sexual dysfunction. The physician may alsoperform a physical exam of the genitals, and may order fur-ther medical tests, including measurement of hormone lev-els in the blood. Men may be referred to a specialist in dis-eases of the urinary and genital organs (urologist), and pri-mary care physicians may refer women to a gynecologist.\\nTreatment\\nTreatments break down into two main kinds: behav-\\nioral psychotherapy and physical. Sex therapy , which is\\nideally provided by a member of the American Associa-tion of Sexual Educators, Counselors, and Therapists(AASECT), universally emphasizes correcting sexualmisinformation, the importance of improved partnercommunication and honesty, anxiety reduction, sensualexperience and pleasure, and interpersonal tolerance andacceptance. Sex therapists believe that many sexual dis-orders are rooted in learned patterns and values. Theseare termed psychogenic. An underlying assumption ofsex therapy is that relatively short-term outpatient thera-py can alleviate learned patterns, restrict symptoms, andallow a greater satisfaction with sexual experiences.\\nIn some cases, a specific technique may be used dur-\\ning intercourse to correct a dysfunction. One of the mostcommon is the “squeeze technique” to prevent prematureejaculation. When a man feels that an orgasm is immi-nent, he withdraws from his partner. Then, the man or hispartner gently squeezes the head of the penis to halt theorgasm. After 20–30 seconds, the couple may resumeintercourse. The couple may do this several times beforethe man proceeds to ejaculation.\\nIn cases where significant sexual dysfunction is\\nlinked to a broader emotional problem, such as depres-sion or substance abuse, intensive psychotherapy and/orpharmaceutical intervention may be appropriate.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3016Sexual dysfunctionGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3016'),\n",

Counseling or psy-chotherapy is highly recommended to address any emo-tional or mental components of the disorder. Botanicalmedicine, either western, Chinese, or ayurvedic, as wellas nutritional supplementation, can help resolve bio-chemical causes of sexual dysfunction. Acupuncture\\nand homeopathic treatment can be helpful by focusing onthe energetic aspects of the disorder.\\nSome problems with sexual function are normal. For\\nexample, women starting a new or first relationship mayfeel sore or bruised after intercourse and find that anover-the-counter lubricant makes sex more pleasurable.Simple techniques, such as soaking in a warm bath, mayrelax a person before intercourse and improve the experi-ence. Yoga and meditation provide needed mental and\\nphysical relaxation for several conditions, such as vagin-ismus. Relaxation therapy eases and relieves anxietyabout dysfunction. Massage is extremely effective atreducing stress , especially if performed by the partner.\\nPrognosis\\nThere is no single cure for sexual dysfunctions, but\\nalmost all can be controlled. Most people who have asexual dysfunction fare well once they get into a treat-ment program. For example, a high percentage of menwith premature ejaculation can be successfully treated intwo to three months.

A paraphilia is a con-dition in which a person’s sexual arousal and gratificationdepend on a fantasy theme of an unusual situation orobject that becomes the principal focus of sexual behavior.\\nDescription\\nParaphilias can revolve around a particular sexual\\nobject or a particular act. They are defined by DSM-IV as\\n“sexual impulse disorders characterized by intenselyarousing, recurrent sexual fantasies, urges and behaviorsconsidered deviant with respect to cultural norms andthat produce clinically significant distress or impairmentin social, occupational or other important areas of psy-chosocial functioning.” The nature of a paraphilia is gen-erally specific and unchanging, and most of the paraphil-ias are far more common in men than in women.\\nParaphilias differ from what some people might con-\\nsider “normal” sexual activity in that these behaviorscause significant distress or impairment in areas of lifefunctioning. They do not refer to the normal use of sexu-al fantasy, activity or objects to heighten sexual excite-ment where there is no distress or impairment. The mostcommon signs of sexual activity that can be classified asparaphilia include: the inability to resist an impulse forthe sexual act, the requirement of participation by non-consenting or under-aged individuals, legal conse-quences, resulting sexual dysfunction , and interference\\nwith normal social relationships.\\nParaphilias include fantasies, behaviors, and/or urges\\nwhich:\\n• involve nonhuman sexual objects, such as shoes or\\nundergarments\\n• require the suffering or humiliation of oneself or part-\\nner\\n• involve children or other non-consenting partners\\nThe most common paraphilias are:\\n• exhibitionism, or exposure of the genitals\\n• fetishism, or the use of nonliving objects• frotteurism, or touching and rubbing against a noncon-\\nsenting person\\n• pedophilia, or the focus on prepubescent children• sexual masochism, or the receiving of humiliation or\\nsuffering\\n• sexual sadism, or the inflicting of humiliation or suffer-\\ning\\n• transvestic fetishism, or cross-dressing• voyeurism, or watching others engage in undressing or\\nsexual activity\\nA paraphiliac often has more than one paraphilia.\\nParaphilias often result in a variety of associated prob-lems, such as guilt, depression, shame, isolation , and\\nimpairment in the capacity for normal social and sexualrelationships. A paraphilia can, and often does, becomehighly idiosyncratic and ritualized.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere is very little certainty about what causes a para-\\nphilia. Psychoanalysts generally theorize that these condi-tions represent a regression to or a fixation at an earlierlevel of psychosexual development resulting in a repetitivepattern of sexual behavior that is not mature in its applica-tion and expression. In other words, an individual repeatsor reverts to a sexual habit arising early in life. Anotherpsychoanalytic theory holds that these conditions are allexpressions of hostility in which sexual fantasies or unusu-al sexual acts become a means of obtaining revenge for achildhood trauma. The persistent, repetitive nature of theparaphilia is caused by an inability to erase the underlyingtrauma completely. Indeed, a history of childhood sexualabuse is sometimes seen in individuals with paraphilias.\\nHowever, behaviorists suggest, instead, that the\\nparaphilia begins via a process of conditioning. Nonsex-ual objects can become sexually arousing if they are fre-quently and repeatedly associated with a pleasurable sex-ual activity. The development of a paraphilia is not usual-ly a matter of conditioning alone; there must usually besome predisposing factor, such as difficulty forming per-son-to-person sexual relationships or poor self-esteem.\\nThe following are situations or causes that might\\nlead someone in a paraphiliac direction:\\n• parents who humiliate and punish a small boy for strut-\\nting around with an erect penis\\n• a young boy who is sexually abused• an individual who is dressed in a woman’s clothes as a\\nform of parental punishment\\n• fear of sexual performance or intimacy• inadequate counseling• excessive alcohol intake• physiological problems• sociocultural factors• psychosexual trauma\\nDiagnosis\\nWhatever the cause, paraphiliacs apparently rarely\\nseek treatment unless they are induced into it by an arrest\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3018Sexual perversionsGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3018'),\n",

This makes diagnosis\\nbefore a confrontation very difficult.\\nParaphiliacs may select an occupation, or develop a\\nhobby or volunteer work, that puts them in contact withthe desired erotic stimuli, for example, selling women’sshoes or lingerie in fetishism, or working with childrenin pedophilia. Other coexistent problems may be alcoholor drug abuse, intimacy problems, and personality distur-bances, especially emotional immaturity. Additionally,there may be sexual dysfunctions. Erectile dysfunctionand an inability to ejaculate may be common in attemptsat sexual activity without the paraphiliac theme.\\nParaphilias may be mild, moderate, or severe. An\\nindividual with mild paraphilia is markedly distressed bythe recurrent paraphiliac urges but has never acted onthem. The moderate has occasionally acted on the para-philic urge. A severe paraphiliac has repeatedly acted onthe urge.\\nTreatment\\nThe literature describing treatment is fragmentary and\\nincomplete. Traditional psychoanalysis has not been par-\\nticularly effective with paraphilia and generally requiresseveral years of treatment. Therapy with hypnosis has alsohad poor results. Current interests focus primarily on sev-eral behavioral techniques that include the following:\\n• Aversion imagery involves the pairing of a sexually\\narousing paraphilic stimulus with an unpleasant image,such as being arrested or having one’s name appear inthe newspaper.\\n• Desensitization procedures neutralize the anxiety-pro-\\nvoking aspects of nonparaphilic sexual situations andbehavior by a process of gradual exposure. For exam-ple, a man afraid of having sexual contact with womenhis own age might be led through a series of relaxationprocedures aimed at reducing his anxiety .\\n• Social skills training is used with either of the other\\napproaches and is aimed at improving a person’s abilityto form interpersonal relationships.\\n• Orgasmic reconditioning may instruct a person to mas-\\nturbate using his paraphilia fantasy and to switch to amore appropriate fantasy just at the moment of orgasm.\\nIn addition to these therapies, drugs are sometimes\\nprescribed to treat paraphilic behaviors. Drugs that drasti-cally lower testosterone temporarily (antiandrogens) havebeen used for the control of repetitive deviant sexualbehaviors and have been prescribed for paraphilia-relateddisorders as well. Cyproterone acetate inhibits testos-terone directly at androgen receptor sites. In its oral form,the usual prescribed dosage range is 50–200 mg per day.KEY TERMS\\nExhibitionism —Obtaining sexual arousal by\\nexposing genitals to an unsuspecting stranger.\\nFetishism —Obtaining sexual arousal using or think-\\ning about an inanimate object or part of the body.\\nFrotteurism —Obtaining sexual arousal and gratifi-\\ncation by rubbing one’s genitals against others inpublic places.\\nMasochism —Sexual arousal by having pain\\nand/or humiliation inflicted upon oneself.\\nPedophilia —Sex or sexual activity with children\\nwho have not reached puberty.\\nSadism —Sexual arousal through inflicting pain on\\nanother person.\\nTransvestitism —Sexual arousal from dressing in\\nthe clothes of the opposite sex.\\nVoyeurism —Sexual arousal by observing nude\\nindividuals without their knowledge.\\nSerotonergics (drugs that boost levels of the brain\\nchemical serotonin) are prescribed for anxious anddepressive symptoms.

Other alternative augmentationstrategies that may be effective include adding a low doseof a secondary amine tricyclic antidepressant to the pri-mary serotonergics, but these reports are only anecdotal.\\nPrognosis\\nDespite more than a decade of experience with psy-\\nchotherapeutic treatment programs, most workers in thefield are not convinced that they have a high degree ofsuccess. Furthermore, because some cases involve severeabuse, many in the general public would prefer to “lockup” the sex offender than to have him out in the commu-nity in a treatment program or on parole after the treat-ment program has been completed.\\nParaphilia and paraphilia-related disorders are more\\nprevalent than most clinicians suspect. Since these disor-ders are cloaked in shame and guilt, the presence of theseconditions may not be adequately revealed until a thera-peutic alliance is firmly established. Once a diagnosis isestablished, appropriate education about possible behav-ioral therapies and appropriate use of psychopharmacolog-ical agents can improve the prognosis for these conditions.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3019Sexual perversionsGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3019'),\n",

Sexually transmitted diseasesare also called venereal diseases.\\nDescription\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n(CDC) has reported that 85% of the most prevalent infec-tious diseases in the United States are sexually transmit-ted. The rate of STDs in this country is 50 to 100 timeshigher than that of any other industrialized nation. One infour sexually active Americans will be affected by anSTD at some time in his or her life.\\nAbout 12 million new STD infections occur in the\\nUnited States each year. One in four occurs in someonebetween the ages of 16 and 19. Almost 65% of all STDinfections affect people under the age of 25.\\nTypes of STDs\\nSTDs can have very painful long-term consequences\\nas well as immediate health problems. They can cause:• birth defects\\n• blindness\\n• bone deformities\\n• brain damage• cancer• heart disease\\n• infertility and other abnormalities of the reproductive\\nsystem\\n• mental retardation•death\\nSome of the most common and potentially serious\\nSTDs in the United States include:\\n• Chlamydia. This STD is caused by the bacterium\\nChlamydia trachomatis , a microscopic organism that\\nlives as a parasite inside human cells. Although over526,000 cases of chlamydia were reported in the UnitedStates in 1997, the CDC estimates that nearly three mil-lion cases occur annually because 75% of women and50% of men show no symptoms of the disease afterinfection. Approximately 40% of women will developpelvic inflammatory disease (PID) as a result of\\nchlamydia infection, a leading cause of infertility.\\n• Human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV causes genital\\nwarts and is the single most important risk factor for\\ncervical cancer in women. Over 100 types of HPV\\nexist, but only about 30 of them can cause genital warts\\nand are spread through sexual contact. In someinstances, warts are passed from mother to child duringchildbirth , leading to a potentially life-threatening\\ncondition for newborns in which warts develop in thethroat (laryngeal papillomatosis).\\n•Genital herpes . Herpes is an incurable viral infection\\nthought to be one of the most common STDs in thiscountry. It is caused by one of two types of herpes sim-plex viruses: HSV-1 (commonly causing oral herpes) orHSV-2 (usually causing genital herpes). The CDC esti-mates that 45 million Americans (one out of every fiveindividuals 12 years of age or older) are infected withHSV-2; this number has increased 30% since the 1970s.HSV-2 infection is more common in women (one out ofevery four women) than men (one out of every fivemen) and in African Americans (45.9%) than Cau-casians (17.6%).\\n•Gonorrhea . The bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae is\\nthe causative agent of gonorrhea and can be spread byvaginal, oral, or anal contact. The CDC reports thatapproximately 650,000 individuals are infected withgonorrhea each year in the United States, with 132.2infections per 100,000 individuals occurring in 1999.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3020Sexually transmitted diseasesGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3020'),\n",

In 1999, 75%of reported gonorrhea cases occurred among AfricanAmericans.\\n•Syphilis . Syphilis is a potentially life-threatening infec-\\ntion that increases the likelihood of acquiring or trans-mitting HIV . In 1998, the CDC reported approximately38,000 cases of syphilis in the United States; thisincluded 800 cases of congenital syphilis. Congenitalsyphilis causes irreversible health problems or death inas many as 40% of all live babies born to women withuntreated syphilis.\\n• Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In\\n2000, the CDC reported that 120,223 people in theUnited States are HIV-positive and 426,350 are livingwith AIDS . In addition, approximately 1,000-2,000\\nchildren are born each year with HIV infection. It isalso estimated that 33 million adults and 1.3 millionchildren worldwide were living with HIV/AIDS as of1999 with 5.4 million being newly infected that year.As of 2001, there is no cure for this STD.\\nSocial groups and STDs\\nSTDs affect certain population groups more severely\\nthan others. Women, young people, and members ofminority groups are particularly affected. Women in anyage bracket are more likely than men to develop medicalcomplications related to STDs. With respect to racial andethnic categories, the incidence of syphilis is 60 timeshigher among African Americans than among Cau-casians, and four times higher in Hispanics than in Ang-los. According to the CDC, in 1999 African Americansaccounted for 77% of the total number of gonorrheacases and nearly 46% of all genital herpes cases.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe symptoms of STDs vary somewhat according to\\nthe disease agent (virus or bacterium), the sex of thepatient, and the body systems affected. The symptoms ofsome STDs are easy to identify; others produce infec-tions that may either go unnoticed for some time or areeasy to confuse with other diseases. Syphilis in particularcan be confused with disorders ranging from infectious\\nmononucleosis to allergic reactions to prescription med-\\nications. In addition, the incubation period of STDsvaries. Some produce symptoms close enough to the timeof sexual contact—often less than 48 hours later—for thepatient to recognize the connection between the behaviorand the symptoms. Others have a longer incubation peri-od, so that the patient may not recognize the early symp-toms as those of a sexually transmitted infection.Some symptoms of STDs affect the genitals and\\nreproductive organs:\\n• A woman who has an STD may bleed when she is not\\nmenstruating or has abnormal vaginal discharge. Vaginalburning, itching , and odor are common, and she may\\nexperience pain in her pelvic area while having sex.\\n• A discharge from the tip of the penis may be a sign that\\na man has an STD. Males may also have painful orburning sensations when they urinate.\\n• There may be swelling of the lymph nodes near the\\ngroin area.\\n• Both men and women may develop skin rashes , sores,\\nbumps, or blisters near the mouth or genitals. Homo-sexual men frequently develop these symptoms in thearea around the anus.\\nOther symptoms of STDs are systemic, which\\nmeans that they affect the body as a whole. These symp-toms may include:\\n• fever, chills, and similar flu-like symptoms\\n• skin rashes over large parts of the body\\n• arthritis-like pains or aching in the joints• throat swelling and redness that lasts for three weeks or\\nlonger\\nDiagnosis\\nA sexually active person who has symptoms of an\\nSTD or who has had an STD or symptoms of infectionshould be examined without delay by one of the follow-ing health care professionals:\\n• a specialist in women’s health (gynecologist)\\n• a specialist in disorders of the urinary tract and the male\\nsexual organs (urologist)\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3021Sexually transmitted diseases\\nSTD cultures on agar plates.

Minors, however, can get treat-ment without their parents’ permission. Public healthdepartments in most states can provide informationabout STD clinic locations; Planned Parenthood facili-ties provide testing and counseling. These agencies canalso help with or assume the responsibility of notifyingsexual partners who must be tested and may requiretreatment.Treatment\\nAlthough self-care can relieve some of the pain of\\ngenital herpes or genital warts that has recurred afterbeing diagnosed and treated by a physician, other STDsymptoms require immediate medical attention.\\nAntibiotics are prescribed to treat gonorrhea,\\nchlamydia, syphilis, and other STDs caused by bacteria.Although prompt diagnosis and early treatment almostalways cures these STDs, new infections can develop ifexposure continues or is renewed.Viral infections can betreated symptomatically with antiviral medications.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for recovery from STDs varies among\\nthe different diseases.

The first step is to placethe baby in a crib or playpen and leave the room in order tocalm down. Counting to 10 and taking deep breaths mayhelp. A friend or relative may be called to come over andassist. A calm adult may then resume trying to comfort thebaby. A warm bottle, a dry diaper, soft music, a bath, or aride in a swing, stroller, or car may be offered to soothe acrying child. Crying may also indicate pain or illness, such\\nas from abdominal cramps or an earache.

Shiatsu involves applying pressure to specialpoints or areas on the body in order to maintain physicaland mental well being, treat disease, or alleviate discom-fort. This therapy is considered holistic because itattempts to treat the whole person instead of a specificmedical complaint. All types of acupressure generallyfocus on the same pressure points and so-called energypathways, but may differ in terms of massage technique.Shiatsu, which can be translated as finger pressure, hasbeen described as needle-free acupuncture .\\nPurpose\\nShiatsu has a strong reputation for reducing stress\\nand relieving nausea and vomiting . Shiatsu is also\\nbelieved to improve circulation and boost the immunesystem. Some people use it to treat diarrhea ,indiges-\\ntion,constipation , and other disorders of the gastroin-\\ntestinal tract; menstrual and menopausal problems;chronic pain ; migraine; arthritis; toothache ; anxiety ;\\nand depression. Shiatsu can be used to relieve muscularpain or tension, especially neck and back pain. It alsoappears to have sedative effects and may alleviate insom-\\nnia. In a broader sense, shiatsu is believed to enhance\\nphysical vitality and emotional well being.\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nShiatsu is an offshoot of anma that developed during\\nthe period after the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Tradition-al massage (anma) used during the age of shoguns wasbeing criticized, and practitioners of koho anma (ancient\\nway) displeased with it introduced new practices andnew names for their therapies.\\nDuring the twentieth century, shiatsu distinguished\\nitself from anma through the merging of Western knowl-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3025ShiatsuGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3025'),\n",

Based on the work of Tamai Tempaku, shiatsuestablished itself in Japan and worldwide. The ShiatsuTherapists Association was founded in 1925 and clinicsand schools followed. Students of Tempaku began teach-ing their own brand of shiatsu, creating branch disci-plines. By 1955, the Japanese Ministry of Health andWelfare acknowledged shiatsu as a beneficial treatment,and licensing was established for practitioners.\\nShiatsu and other forms of Japanese acupressure are\\nbased on the concept of ki, the Japanese term for the all-\\npervading energy that flows through everything in theuniverse. (This notion is borrowed from the Chinese,who refer to the omnipresent energy as qi or chi.) Kitends to flow through the body along special energypathways called meridians, each of which is associatedwith a vital organ. In Asian systems of traditional medi-cine, diseases are often believed to occur due to disrup-tions in the flow this energy through the body. These dis-ruptions may stem from emotional factors, climate, or ahost of other causes including stress, the presence ofimpurities in the body, and physical trauma.\\nThe aim of shiatsu is to restore the proper flow of\\nbodily energy by massaging the surface of the skin alongthe meridian lines. Pressure may also be applied to anyof the 600 or so acupoints. Acupoints, which are suppos-edly located just under the skin along the meridians, aretiny energy structures that affect the flow of ki throughthe body. When ki either stagnates and becomes deflect-ed or accumulates in excess along one of these channels,stimulation to the acupoints, which are sensitive to pres-sure, can unblock and regulate the ki flow through toningor sedating treatment.\\nWestern medicine hasn’t proven the existence of\\nmeridians and acupoints. However, in one study, twoFrench medical doctors conducted an experiment atNecher Hospital in Paris to test validity of the theory thatenergy is being transported along acupuncture meridians.They injected and traced isotpes with gamma-cameraimaging. The meridians may actually correspond tonerve transmission lines. In this view, shiatsu and otherforms of healing massage may trigger the emission ofnaturally occurring chemicals called neurotransmitters.Release of these chemical messengers may be responsi-ble for some of the therapeutic effects associated withshiatsu, such as pain relief.\\nPreparations\\nPeople usually receive shiatsu therapy while lying\\non a floor mat or massage table or sitting up. The mas-sage is performed through the clothing—preferably athin garment made from natural fibers—and disrobing is\\nnot required. Pressure is often applied using the thumbs,though various other parts of the body may be employed,including fingertips, palms, knuckles, elbows, andknees—some therapists even use their feet. Shiatsu typi-cally consists of sustained pressure (lasting up to 10 sec-onds at a time), squeezing, and stretching exercises. Itmay also involve gentle holding as well as rockingmotions. A treatment session lasts anywhere from 30 to90 minutes.\\nBefore shiatsu treatment begins, the therapist usual-\\nly performs a general health assessment. This involvestaking a family medical history and discussing the physi-cal and emotional health of the person seeking therapy.Typically, the practitioner also conducts a diagnosticexamination by palpating the abdomen or back for anyenergy imbalances present in other parts of the body.\\nPrecautions\\nWhile shiatsu is generally considered safe, there are\\na few precautions to consider. Because it may increaseblood flow, this type of therapy is not recommended inpeople with bleeding problems, heart disease, or cancer .\\nMassage therapy should always be used with caution in\\nthose with osteoporosis , fresh wounds or scar tissue,\\nbone fractures , or inflammation.\\nApplying pressure to areas of the head is not recom-\\nmended in people with epilepsy or high blood pressure,according to some practitioners of shiatsu.\\nShiatsu is not considered effective in the treatment\\nof fever ,burns , and infectious diseases.\\nShiatsu should not be performed right after a meal.\\nSide effects\\nWhen performed properly, shiatsu is not associated\\nwith any significant side effects. Some people may expe-rience mild discomfort, which usually disappears duringthe course of the treatment session.\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nLike many forms of massage, shiatsu is widely\\nbelieved to have a relaxing effect on the body. There isalso a significant amount of research suggesting that acu-pressure techniques can relieve nausea and vomitingassociated with a variety of causes, including pregnancy\\nand anesthetics and other drugs. In one study, acupres-sure was shown to significantly reduce the effects of nau-sea in 12 of 16 women suffering from morning sickness.Five days of this therapy also appeared to reduce anxietyand improve mood.

Inthis study, which involved 40 knee surgery patients, onegroup received acupressure (15 acupoints were stimulat-ed) while the control group received sham acupressure.Within an hour of treatment, members of the acupressuregroup reported less pain than those in the control group.The pain-relieving effects associated with acupressurelasted for 24 hours.\\nShiatsu may benefit stroke victims.

The most serious form of the disease iscalled dysentery, which is characterized by severe watery(and often blood- and mucous-streaked) diarrhea,abdominal cramping, rectal pain , and fever. Shigella is\\nonly one of several organisms that can cause dysentery,but the term bacillary dysentery is usually another namefor shigellosis.\\nMost deaths are in less-developed or developing coun-\\ntries, but even in the United States, shigellosis can be a dan-gerous and potentially deadly disease. Poor hygiene, over-crowding, and improper storage of food are leading causesof infection. The following statistics show the marked dif-ference in the frequency of cases between developed andless-developed countries; in the United States, about30,000 individuals are hit by the disease each year or about10 cases/100,000 population. On the other hand, infectionin some areas of South America is 1,000 times more fre-quent. Shigellosis is most common in children below agefive, and occurs less often in adults over 20.\\nCauses and Symptoms\\nShigella share several of the characteristics of a group\\nof bacteria that inhabit the intestinal tract. E. coli, another\\ncause of food-borne illness, can be mistaken for Shigella\\nboth by physicians and the laboratory. Careful testing isneeded to assure proper diagnosis and treatment.\\nShigella are very resistant to the acid produced by\\nthe stomach, and this allows them to easily pass throughthe gastrointestinal tract and infect the colon (large intes-tine). The result is a colitis that produces multiple ulcers,which can bleed. Shigella also produce a number of tox-\\nins (Shiga toxin and others) that increase the amount offluid secretion by the intestinal tract. This fluid secretionis a major cause of the diarrhea symptoms.\\nShigella infection spreads through food or water\\ncontaminated by human waste. Sources of transmissionare:\\n• contaminated milk, ice cream, vegetables and other\\nfoods which often cause epidemics\\n• household contacts (40% of adults and 20% of children\\nwill develop infection from such a source)\\n• poor hygiene and overcrowded living conditions\\n• day care centers\\n• sexual practices which lead to oral-anal contact, direct-\\nly or indirectly\\nSymptoms can be limited to only mild diarrhea or go\\non to full-blown dysentery. Dehydration results from thelarge fluid losses due to diarrhea, vomiting and fever.Inability to eat or drink worsens the situation.In developed countries, most infections are of the\\nless severe type, and are often due to S. sonnei . The peri-\\nod between infection and symptoms (incubation period)varies from one to seven days. Shigellosis can last from afew days to several weeks, with an average of seven days.\\nComplications\\nAreas outside the intestine can be involved, includ-\\ning:\\n• nervous system (irritation of the meninges or meningi-\\ntis,encephalitis , and seizures)\\n• kidneys (producing hemolytic uremic syndrome or\\nHUS which leads to kidney failure)\\n• joints (leading to an unusual form of arthritis called\\nReiter’s syndrome )\\n• skin (rash)\\nOne of the most serious complications of this dis-\\nease is HUS, which involves the kidney. The main find-ings are kidney failure and damage to red blood cells. Asmany as 15% of patients die from this complication, andhalf the survivors develop chronic kidney failure ,\\nrequiring dialysis.\\nAnother life-threatening condition is toxic mega-\\ncolon. Severe inflammation causes the colon to dilate orstretch, and the thin colon wall may eventually tear. Cer-tain medications (particularly those that diminish intesti-nal contractions) may increase this risk, but this interac-tion is unclear. Clues to this diagnosis include suddendecrease in diarrhea, swelling of the abdomen, and wors-ening abdominal pain.\\nDiagnosis\\nShigellosis is one of the many causes of acute diar-\\nrhea. Culture (growing the bacteria in the laboratory) offreshly obtained diarrhea fluid is the only way to be cer-tain of the diagnosis. But even this is not always positive,especially if the patient is already on antibiotics . Shigel-\\nlaare identified by a combination of their appearance\\nunder the microscope and various chemical tests. Thesestudies take several days, so quicker means to recognizethe bacteria and its toxins are being developed.\\nTreatment\\nThe first aim of treatment is to keep up nutrition\\nand avoid dehydration. Ideally, a physician should beconsulted before starting any treatment. Antibiotics maynot be necessary, except for the more severe infections.Many cases resolve before the diagnosis is established byculture.

Commer-cial preparations, such as Pedialyte, are also available. Inmany patients with mild symptoms, this is the only treat-ment needed. Severe dehydration usually requires intra-venous fluid replacement.\\nAntibiotics\\nIn the early and mid-1990s, researchers began to\\nrealize that not all cases of bacterial dysentery neededantibiotic treatment. Many patients improve without suchtherapy, and therefore these drugs are indicated only fortreatment of moderate or severe disease, as found in thetropics. Choice of antibiotic is based on the type of bac-teria found in the geographical area and on laboratoryresults. Recommendations as of 1997 include ampicillin,sulfa derivatives such as Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxa-zole (TMP-SMX) sold as Bactrim, or fluoroquinolones\\n(such as Ciprofloxacin which is not FDA approved foruse in children).\\nPrognosis\\nMany patients with mild infections need no specific\\ntreatment and recover completely. In those with severeinfections, antibiotics will decrease the length of symptomsand the number of days bacteria appear in the feces. In rarecases, an individual may fail to clear the bacteria from theintestinal tract; the result is a persistent carrier state. Thismay be more frequent in AIDS (Acquired Immune Defi-\\nciency Syndrome) patients. Antibiotics are about 90%effective in eliminating these chronic infections.\\nIn patients who have suffered particularly severe\\nattacks, some degree of cramping and diarrhea can lastfor several weeks. This is usually due to damage to theintestinal tract, which requires some time to heal. Sinceantibiotics can also produce a form of colitis, this mustbe considered as a possible cause of persistent or recur-rent symptoms.\\nPrevention\\nShigellosis is an extremely contagious disease; good\\nhand washing techniques and proper precautions in foodhandling will help in avoiding spread of infection. Chil-dren in day care centers need to be reminded about handwashing during an outbreak to minimize spread. Shigel-\\nlosis in schools or day care settings almost always disap-\\npears when holiday breaks occur, which sever the chainof transmission.\\nTraveler’s diarrhea (TD)\\nShigella accounts for about 10% of diarrhea illness\\nin travelers to Mexico, South America, and the tropics.Most cases of TD are more of a nuisance than a life-threatening disease. However, bloody diarrhea is an indi-cation that Shigella may be responsible.\\nIn some cases though, aside from ruining a well\\ndeserved vacation, these infections can interrupt businessconference schedules and, in the worst instances, lead toa life-threatening illness. Therefore, researchers havetried to find a safe, yet effective, way of preventing TD.Of course the best prevention is to follow closely therules outlined by the WHO and other groups regardingeating fresh fruits, vegetables, and other foods.\\nOne safe and effective method of preventing TD is\\nthe use of large doses of Pepto Bismol. Tablets are nowavailable which are easier for travel; usage must start afew days before departure. Patients should be aware thatBismuth will turn bowel movements black.\\nAntibiotics have also proven to be highly effective in\\npreventing TD.

The virus that causes chickenpox ,\\nthe varicella zoster virus (VSV), can become dormant innerve cells after an episode of chickenpox and laterreemerge as shingles. Initially, red patches of rash devel-op into blisters. Because the virus travels along the nerveto the skin, it can damage the nerve and cause it tobecome inflamed. This condition can be very painful. Ifthe pain persists long after the rash disappears, it is\\nknown as post-herpetic neuralgia .\\nDescription\\nAny individual who has had chickenpox can develop\\nshingles. Approximately 300,000 cases of shingles occurevery year in the United States. Overall, approximately20% of those who had chickenpox as children developshingles at some time in their lives. People of all ages,even children, can be affected, but the incidence increas-es with age. Newborn infants, bone marrow and othertransplant recipients, as well as indivduals with immunesystems weakened by disease or drugs are also atincreased risk. However, most individuals who developshingles do not have any underlying malignancy or otherimmunosuppressive condition.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nShingles erupts along the course of the affected\\nnerve, producing lesions anywhere on the body and maycause severe nerve pain. The most common areas to beaffected are the face and trunk, which correspond to theareas where the chickenpox rash is most concentrated.The disease is caused by a reactivation of the chickenpoxvirus that has lain dormant in certain nerves following anepisode of chickenpox. Exactly how or why this reactiva-tion occurs is not clear, however, it is believed that thereactivation is triggered when the immune systembecomes weakened, either as a result of stress ,fatigue ,\\ncertain medications, chemotherapy , or diseases, such as\\ncancer or HIV . Further, it can be an early sign in persons\\nwith HIV that the immune system has deteriorated.\\nEarly signs of shingles are often vague and can easi-\\nly be mistaken for other illnesses. The condition maybegin with fever and malaise (a vague feeling of weak-\\nness or discomfort). Within two to four days, severe pain,itching , and numbness/tingling (paresthesia) or extremesensitivity to touch (hyperesthesia) can develop, usually\\non the trunk and occasionally on the arms and legs. Painmay be continuous or intermittent, usually lasting fromone to four weeks.

In most people, the condition clears on itsown in one or two weeks and seldom recurs.\\nCool, wet compresses may help reduce pain. If there\\nare blisters or crusting, applying compresses made withdiluted vinegar will make the patient more comfortable.Mix one-quarter cup of white vinegar in two quarts oflukewarm water. Use the compress twice each day for 10minutes. Stop using the compresses when the blistershave dried up.\\nSoothing baths and lotions such as colloidal oatmeal\\nbaths, starch baths or lotions, and calamine lotion mayhelp to relieve itching and discomfort. Keep the skinclean, and do not re-use contaminated items. While thelesions continue to ooze, the person should be isolated toprevent infecting other susceptible individuals.\\nLater, when the crusts and scabs are separating, the\\nskin may become dry, tight, and cracked. If that happens,rub on a small amount of plain petroleum jelly three orfour times a day.\\nThe antiviral drugs acyclovir, valacyclovir, and\\nfamciclovir can be used to treat shingles. These drugsmay shorten the course of the illness. Their use results inmore rapid healing of the blisters when drug therapy isstarted within 72 hours of the onset of the rash. In fact,the earlier the drugs are administered, the better, becauseearly cases can sometimes be stopped. If taken later,these drugs are less effective but may still lessen the pain.Antiviral drug treatment does not seem to reduce theincidence of post-herpetic neuralgia, but recent studiessuggest famciclovir may cut the duration of post-herpeticneuralgia in half. Side effects of typical oral doses ofthese antiviral drugs are minor with headache and nau-\\nsea reported by 8–20 % of patients. Severely immuno-compromised individuals, such as those with AIDS ,m a y\\nrequire intravenous administration of antiviral drugs.\\nCorticosteroids , such as prednisone, may be used to\\nreduce inflammation but do interfere with the function-ing of the immune system. Corticosteroids, in combina-tion with antiviral therapy, also are used to treat severeinfections, such as those affecting the eyes, and to reducesevere pain.\\nOnce the blisters are healed, some people continue\\nto experience pain for months or even years (post-herpet-ic neuralgia). This pain can be excruciating. Consequent-\\nly, the doctor may prescribe tranquilizers, sedatives, orantidepressants to be taken at night. As noted above,attempts to treat post-herpetic neuralgia with the antiviraldrug famciclovir have shown some promising results.When all else fails, severe pain may require a permanentnerve block.\\nAlternative treatment\\nThere are non-medical methods of prevention and\\ntreatment that may speed recovery. For example, gettinglots of rest, eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly,and minimizing stress are always helpful in preventingdisease. Supplementation with vitamin B\\n12during the\\nfirst one to two days and continued supplementation withvitamin B complex, high levels of vitamin C withbioflavenoids, and calcium, are recommended to boostthe immune system. Herbal antivirals such as echinacea\\ncan be effective in fighting infection and boosting theimmune system.\\nAlthough no single alternative approach, technique,\\nor remedy has yet been proven to reduce the pain, thereare a few options which may be helpful. For example,topical applications of lemon balm ( Melissa officinalis )\\nor licorice ( Glycyrrhiza glabra ) and peppermint ( Mentha\\npiperita ) may reduce pain and blistering. Homeopathic\\nremedies include Rhus toxicodendron for blisters, Mez-\\nereum and Arsenicum album for pain, and Ranunculus\\nfor itching. Practitioners of Eastern medicine recom-mend self-hypnosis, acupressure , and acupuncture to\\nalleviate pain.\\nPrognosis\\nShingles usually clears up in two to three weeks and\\nrarely recurs. Involvement of the nerves that cause move-ment may cause a temporary or permanent nerve paraly-\\nsisand/or tremors . The elderly or debilitated patient\\nmay have a prolonged and difficult course. For them, theeruption is typically more extensive and inflammatory,occasionally resulting in blisters tha t bleed, areas where\\nthe skin actually dies, secondary bacterial infection, orextensive and permanent scarring.\\nSimilarly, an immunocompromised patient usually\\nhas a more severe course that is frequently prolonged forweeks to months. They develop shingles frequently andthe infection can spread to the skin, lungs, liver, gastroin-testinal tract, brain, or other vital organs. Cases of chron-ic shingles have been reported in patients infected withAIDS, especially when they have a decreased number ofone particular kind of immune cell, called CD4 lympho-cytes. Depletion of CD4 lymphocytes is associated withmore severe, chronic, and recurrent varicella-zoster virus\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3032ShinglesGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3032'),\n",

This deprives the organs and tissues ofoxygen (carried in the blood) and allows the buildup ofwaste products. Shock can result in serious damage oreven death .\\nDescription\\nThere are three stages of shock: Stage I (also called\\ncompensated, or nonprogressive), Stage II (also calleddecompensated or progressive), and Stage III (also calledirreversible).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3033ShockGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3033'),\n",

The result is that theheart beats faster, the blood vessels throughout the bodybecome slightly smaller in diameter, and the kidneyworks to retain fluid in the circulatory system. All thisserves to maximize blood flow to the most importantorgans and systems in the body. The patient in this stageof shock has very few symptoms, and treatment can com-pletely halt any progression.\\nIn Stage II of shock, these methods of compensation\\nbegin to fail. The systems of the body are unable toimprove perfusion any longer, and the patient’s symp-toms reflect that fact. Oxygen deprivation in the braincauses the patient to become confused and disoriented,while oxygen deprivation in the heart may cause chestpain . With quick and appropriate treatment, this stage of\\nshock can be reversed.\\nIn Stage III of shock, the length of time that poor\\nperfusion has existed begins to take a permanent toll onthe body’s organs and tissues. The heart’s functioningcontinues to spiral downward, and the kidneys usuallyshut down completely. Cells in organs and tissuesthroughout the body are injured and dying. The endpointof Stage III shock is the patient’s death.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nShock is caused by three major categories of problems:\\ncardiogenic (meaning problems associated with the heart’sfunctioning); hypovolemic (meaning that the total volumeof blood available to circulate is low); and septic shock\\n(caused by overwhelming infection, usually by bacteria).\\nCardiogenic shock can be caused by any disease, or\\nevent, which prevents the heart muscle from pumpingstrongly and consistently enough to circulate the bloodnormally. Heart attack , conditions which cause inflam-\\nmation of the heart muscle ( myocarditis ), disturbances of\\nthe electrical rhythm of the heart, any kind of mass or fluidaccumulation and/or blood clot which interferes with flowout of the heart can all significantly affect the heart’s abili-ty to adequately pump a normal quantity of blood.\\nHypovolemic shock occurs when the total volume of\\nblood in the body falls well below normal. This canoccur when there is excess fluid loss, as in dehydration\\ndue to severe vomiting or diarrhea , diseases which\\ncause excess urination ( diabetes insipidus ,diabetes\\nmellitus , and kidney failure), extensive burns , blockage\\nin the intestine, inflammation of the pancreas ( pancre-\\natitis ), or severe bleeding of any kind.\\nSeptic shock can occur when an untreated or inade-\\nquately treated infection (usually bacterial) is allowed toKEY TERMS\\nCardiogenic —Originating with the heart.\\nDeprivation —A condition of having too little of\\nsomething.\\nHypovolemic —Having a low volume.\\nPerfusion —Blood flow through an organ or tissue.\\nSepsis —An overwhelming infection throughout\\nthe body, usually caused by bacteria in the blood-stream.\\nprogress. Bacteria often produce poisonous chemicals\\n(toxins) which can cause injury throughout the body.When large quantities of these bacteria, and their toxins,begin circulating in the bloodstream, every organ and tis-sue in the body is at risk of their damaging effects. Themost damaging consequences of these bacteria and tox-ins include poor functioning of the heart muscle; widen-ing of the diameter of the blood vessels; a drop in bloodpressure; activation of the blood clotting system, causingblood clots, followed by a risk of uncontrollable bleed-ing; damage to the lungs, causing acute respiratory dis-\\ntress syndrome ; liver failure; kidney failure; and coma .\\nInitial symptoms of shock include cold, clammy\\nhands and feet; pale or blue-tinged skin tone; weak, fastpulse rate; fast rate of breathing; low blood pressure. Avariety of other symptoms may be present, but they aredependent on the underlying cause of shock.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of shock is based on the patient’s symp-\\ntoms, as well as criteria including a significant drop inblood pressure, extremely low urine output, and bloodtests that reveal overly acidic blood with a low circulat-ing concentration of carbon dioxide. Other tests are per-formed, as appropriate, to try to determine the underlyingcondition responsible for the patient’s state of shock.\\nTreatment\\nThe most important goals in the treatment of shock\\ninclude: quickly diagnosing the patient’s state of shock;quickly intervening to halt the underlying condition(stopping bleeding, re-starting the heart, giving antibi-\\notics to combat an infection, etc.); treating the effects of\\nshock (low oxygen, increased acid in the blood, activa-tion of the blood clotting system); and supporting vitalfunctions (blood pressure, urine flow, heart function).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3034ShockGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3034'),\n",

It is a symptom of avariety of different diseases or disorders and may beeither acute or chronic.\\nDescription\\nThe experience of dyspnea depends on its severity\\nand underlying causes. The feeling itself results from acombination of impulses relayed to the brain from nerveendings in the lungs, rib cage, chest muscles, or dia-phragm, combined with the patient’s perception andinterpretation of the sensation. In some cases, thepatient’s sensation of breathlessness is intensified byanxiety about its cause. Patients describe dyspnea vari-\\nously as unpleasant shortness of breath, a feeling ofincreased effort or tiredness in moving the chest muscles,a panicky feeling of being smothered, or a sense of tight-ness or cramping in the chest wall.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nACUTE DYSPNEA. Acute dyspnea with sudden onset\\nis a frequent cause of emergency room visits. Most casesof acute dyspnea involve pulmonary (lung and breathing)disorders, cardiovascular disease, or chest trauma.\\nPULMONARY DISORDERS. Pulmonary disorders that\\ncan cause dyspnea include airway obstruction by a for-eign object, swelling due to infection, or anaphylacticshock ; acute pneumonia ; hemorrhage from the lungs; or\\nsevere bronchospasms associated with asthma .\\nCARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. Acute dyspnea can be\\ncaused by disturbances of the heart rhythm, failure of theleft ventricle, mitral valve (a heart valve) dysfunction, oran embolus (a clump of tissue, fat, or gas) that is block-ing the pulmonary circulation. Most pulmonary emboli(blood clots) originate in the deep veins of the lower legsand eventually migrate to the pulmonary artery.\\nTRAUMA. Chest injuries, both closed injuries and\\npenetrating wounds , can cause pneumothorax (the\\npresence of air inside the chest cavity), bruises , or frac-\\ntured ribs. Pain from these injuries results in dyspnea.\\nThe impact of the driver’s chest against the steeringwheel in auto accidents is a frequent cause of closedchest injuries.\\nOTHER CAUSES. Anxiety attacks sometimes cause\\nacute dyspnea; they may or may not be associated withchest pain. Anxiety attacks are often accompanied byhyperventilation, which is a breathing pattern character-ized by abnormally rapid and deep breaths. Hyperventi-lation raises the oxygen level in the blood, causing chestpain and dizziness .\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3035Shortness of breathGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3035'),\n",

Chronic dyspnea can be\\ncaused by asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD), bronchitis ,emphysema , inflammation of the\\nlungs, pulmonary hypertension , tumors, or disorders of\\nthe vocal cords.\\nHEART DISEASE. Disorders of the left side of the\\nheart or inadequate supply of blood to the heart musclecan cause dyspnea. In some cases a tumor in the heart orinflammation of the membrane surrounding the heartmay cause dyspnea.\\nNEUROMUSCULAR DISORDERS. Neuromuscular dis-\\norders cause dyspnea from progressive deterioration ofthe patient’s chest muscles. They include muscular dys-\\ntrophy ,myasthenia gravis , and amyotrophic lateral\\nsclerosis .\\nOTHER CAUSES. Patients who are severely anemic\\nmay develop dyspnea if they exercise vigorously.\\nHyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism may cause short-\\nness of breath, and so may gastroesophageal reflux dis-ease (GERD). Both chronic anxiety disorders and a low\\nlevel of physical fitness can also cause episodes of dysp-nea. Deformities of the chest or obesity can cause dysp-\\nnea by limiting the movement of the chest wall and theability of the lungs to fill completely.\\nDiagnosis\\nPatient history\\nThe patient’s history provides the doctor with such\\nnecessary information as a history of gastroesophagealreflux disease (GERD), asthma, or other allergic condi-tions; the presence of chest pain as well as difficultybreathing; recent accidents or recent surgery; informa-tion about smoking habits; the patient’s baseline level of\\nphysical activity and exercise habits; and a psychiatrichistory of panic attacks or anxiety disorders.\\nASSESSMENT OF BODY POSITION. How a person’s\\nbody position affects his/her dyspnea symptoms some-times gives hints as to the underlying cause of the disor-der. Dyspnea that is worse when the patient is sitting upis called platypnea and indicates the possibility of liverdisease. Dyspnea that is worse when the patient is lyingdown is called orthopnea, and is associated with heartdisease or paralysis of the diaphragm. Paroxysmal noc-\\nturnal dyspnea (PND) refers to dyspnea that occurs dur-ing sleep and forces the patient to awake gasping forbreath. It is usually relieved if the patient sits up orstands. PND may point to dysfunction of the left ventri-cle of the heart, hypertension , or narrowing of the\\nmitral valve.Physical examination\\nThe doctor will examine the patient’s chest in order\\nto determine the rate and depth of breathing, the effortrequired, the condition of the patient’s breathing mus-cles, and any evidence of chest deformities or trauma.He or she will listen for wheezing ,stridor , or signs of\\nfluid in the lungs. If the patient has a fever , the doctor\\nwill look for other signs of pneumonia. The doctor willcheck the patient’s heart functions, including bloodpressure, pulse rate, and the presence of heart mur-\\nmurs or other abnormal heart sounds. If the doctor sus-\\npects a blood clot in one of the large veins leading to theheart, he or she will examine the patient’s legs for signsof swelling.\\nDiagnostic tests\\nBASIC DIAGNOSTIC TESTS. Patients who are seen in\\nemergency rooms are given a chest x ray and electrocar-\\ndiogram (ECG) to assist the doctor in evaluating abnor-malities of the chest wall, also to determine the positionof the diaphragm, possible rib fractures or pneumotho-\\nrax, irregular heartbeat, or the adequacy of the supply ofblood to the heart muscle. Also, the patient may be givena breathing test on an instrument called a spirometer toscreen for airway disorders.\\nThe doctor may order blood tests and arterial blood\\ngas tests to rule out anemia, hyperventilation from ananxiety attack, or thyroid dysfunction. A sputum culture\\ncan be used to test for pneumonia.\\nSPECIALIZED TESTS. Specialized tests may be\\nordered for patients with normal results from basicdiagnostic tests for dyspnea. High-resolution CTscans can be used for suspected airway obstruction ormild emphysema. Tissue biopsy performed with abronchoscope can be used for patients with suspectedlung disease.\\nIf the doctor suspects a pulmonary embolism , he or\\nshe may order ventilation-perfusion scanning to inspectlung function, an angiogram of blood vessels, or ultra-sound studies of the leg veins. Echocardiography can be\\nused to test for pulmonary hypertension and heart disease.\\nPulmonary function studies or electromyography\\n(EMG) are used to assess neuromuscular diseases. Exer-cise testing is used to assess dyspnea related to COPD,anxiety attacks, poor physical fitness, and the severity oflung or heart disease. The level of acidity in the patient’sesophagus may be monitored to rule out GERD.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of dyspnea depends on its underlying cause.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3036Shortness of breathGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3036'),\n",

Frey\\nShy-Drager syndrome\\nDefinition\\nShy-Drager syndrome (SDS) is a rare condition that\\ncauses progressive damage to the autonomic nervoussystem. The autonomic nervous system controls vitalinvoluntary body functions such as heart rate, breathing,and intestinal, urinary, and sexual functions. The auto-nomic nervous system also controls skin and body tem-perature, and how the body responds to stress . Shy-\\nDrager syndrome leads to dizziness or fainting when\\nstanding up, urinary incontinence ,impotence , and\\nmuscle tremors .\\nDescription\\nSDS was named for neurologists Milton Shy, M.D.,\\nfrom the National Institutes of Health, and Glenn Drager,M.D., from the Baylor College of Medicine, who firstdescribed the condition in 1960. It typically affects thosebetween ages 50-70. It affects more men than women. Insevere cases, the person cannot even stand up. Symptomscan be mild as well. Sometimes, people with mild casesare misdiagnosed as having anxiety or hypertension .\\nMany nonprescription drugs, such as cold medicines\\nand diet capsules, can trigger extremely high blood pres-sure spikes in patients with SDS, even in very low doses.Therefore, these patients are at risk for strokes and exces-sive bleeding (hemorrhage) if they take even the recom-mended dosage of these drugs.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of SDS is unknown. Symptoms develop\\nbecause of degeneration of certain groups of nerve cellsin the spinal cord.\\nPatients with SDS usually have problems with the\\nfunction of the autonomic nervous system. Progressivedegeneration may occur in other areas of the nervous sys-tem as well. The hallmark of the syndrome is dizzinessand fainting when arising or after standing still for a longtime (postural hypotension ). This is caused by low blood\\npressure and inadequate blood flow to the brain. Whenthis problem becomes severe (for example, a blood pres-sure below 70/40 mmHg), it can lead to a momentary lossof consciousness. When the person faints, the blood pres-sure returns to normal and the person wakes up.\\nMany patients also notice impotence, urinary incon-\\ntinence, dry mouth and skin, and trouble regulating\\nbody temperature because of abnormal sweating. Sincethe autonomic nervous system also controls the narrow-ing and widening of the iris, some patients with SDShave vision problems, such as trouble focusing.\\nIn later stages, problems in the autonomic nervous\\nsystem lead to breathing difficulties such as sleep apnea ,\\nloud breathing, and snoring . In advanced stages of the\\ndisease, patients can die from irregular heartbeat.\\nOther symptoms of SDS do not involve the autonom-\\nic nervous system. These include parkinsonism (muscletremor, rigidity, and slow movements), double vision,problems controlling emotions, and wasting of muscles inthe hands and feet. Eventually, patients may have prob-lems chewing, swallowing, speaking, and breathing.There may be a loss of color pigment in the iris.\\nDiagnosis\\nWhile no blood test can reveal the disorder, a careful\\nassessment of symptoms should alert a neurologist tosuspect SDS. A combination of parkinsonism and certainautonomic problems (especially impotence, inconti-nence, and postural hypotension) are clear indications ofthe syndrome.\\nTests of the autonomic nervous system may help\\ndiagnose the condition. In normal patients, blood levelsof norepinephrine rise when they stand up. This doesn’thappen in people with SDS.

However, thetreatment of sick sinus syndrome is normally delayeduntil a patient shows symptoms. Once treatment isindicated, most patients will receive a pacemaker. Thisis a permanent treatment involving implantation of asmall device under the skin below the collarbone.Small electrodes run from the device to the heart; theydeliver and regulate the electrical signals that cause theheart to beat. Patients with sick sinus syndrome shouldgenerally receive dual chamber pacing systems to pre-vent atrial fibrillation (involuntary contraction of themuscles of the atria).

The red blood cells of affect-ed individuals contain a predominance of a structuralvariant of the usual adult hemoglobin. This varianthemoglobin, called sickle hemoglobin, has a tendencyto polymerize into rod-like structures that alter theshape of the usually flexible red blood cells. The cellstake on a shape that resembles the curved blade of thesickle, an agricultural tool. Sickle cells have a shorterlife span than normally-shaped red blood cells. Thisresults in chronic anemia characterized by low levels ofhemoglobin and decreased numbers of red blood cells.Sickle cells are also less flexible and more sticky thannormal red blood cells, and can become trapped insmall blood vessels preventing blood flow. This com-promises the delivery of oxygen, which can result inpain and damage to associated tissues and organs. Sick-\\nle cell disease presents with marked variability, evenwithin families.\\nCarriers of the sickle cell gene are said to have\\nsickle cell trait. Unlike sickle cell disease, sickle celltrait does not cause health problems. In fact, sickle celltrait is protective against malaria , a disease caused by\\nblood-borne parasites transmitted through mosquitobites. According to a widely accepted theory, the genet-ic mutation associated with the sickle cell trait occurredthousands of years ago. Coincidentally, this mutationincreased the likelihood that carriers would survivemalaria infection. Survivors then passed the mutationon to their offspring, and the trait became establishedthroughout areas where malaria was common. As popu-lations migrated, so did the sickle cell trait. Today,approximately one in 12 African Americans has sicklecell trait.\\nWorldwide, it has been estimated that one in every\\n250,000 babies is born annually with sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease primarily affects people of African,Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Asian Indianancestry. In the United States, sickle cell disease ismost often seen in African Americans, in whom the dis-ease occurs in one out of every 400 births. The diseasehas been described in individuals from several differentethnic backgrounds and is also seen with increased fre-quency in Latino Americans—particularly those ofCaribbean, Central American, and South Americanancestry. Approximately one in every 1000-1400 Latinobirths are affected.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nHumans normally make several types of the oxy-\\ngen-carrying protein hemoglobin. An individual’s stagein development determines whether he or she makes pri-marily embryonic, fetal, or adult hemoglobins. All typesof hemoglobin are made of three components: heme,alpha (or alpha-like) globin, and beta (or beta-like) glo-bin. Sickle hemoglobin is the result of a genetic changein the beta globin component of normal adult hemoglo-bin. The beta globin gene is located on chromosome 11.The sickle cell form of the beta globin gene results fromthe substitution of a single DNA nucleotide, or geneticbuilding-block. The change from adenine to thymine atcodon (position) 6 of the beta globin gene leads to inser-tion of the amino acid valine–instead of glutamicacid–at this same position in the beta globin protein. Asa result of this change, sickle hemoglobin has uniqueproperties in comparison to the usual type of adulthemoglobin.\\nMost individuals have two normal copies of the\\nbeta globin gene, which make normal beta globin that isincorporated into adult hemoglobin. Individuals whohave sickle cell trait (called sickle cell carriers) haveone normal beta globin gene and one sickle cell gene.These individuals make both the usual adult hemoglo-bin and sickle hemoglobin in roughly equal propor-tions, so they do not experience any health problems asa result of having the trait. Although traces of blood in\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3041Sickle cell diseaseGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3041'),\n",

Of the millions of peoplewith sickle cell trait worldwide, a small handful of indi-viduals have experienced acute symptoms. In these veryrare cases, individuals were subject to very severe phys-ical strain.\\nWhen both members of a couple are carriers of\\nsickle cell trait, there is a 25% chance in each pregnan-\\ncyfor the baby to inherit two sickle cell genes and have\\nsickle cell anemia, or SS disease. Correspondingly, thereis a 50% chance the baby will have sickle cell trait and a25% chance that the baby will have the usual type ofhemoglobin. Other types of sickle cell disease includeSC disease, SD disease, and S/beta thalassemia . These\\nconditions are caused by the co-inheritance of the sicklecell gene and another altered beta globin gene. Forexample, one parent may have sickle cell trait and theother parent may have hemoglobin C trait (anotherhemoglobin trait that does not cause health problems).For this couple, there would be a 25% chance of SC dis-ease in each pregnancy.\\nNormal adult hemoglobin transports oxygen from\\nthe lungs to tissues throughout the body. Sickle hemoglo-bin can also transport oxygen. However, once the oxygenis released, sickle hemoglobin tends to polymerize (line-up) into rigid rods that alter the shape of the red bloodcell. Sickling of the red blood cell can be triggered bylow oxygen, such as occurs in organs with slow bloodflow. It can also be triggered by cold temperatures anddehydration .\\nSickle cells have a decreased life span in comparison\\nto normal red blood cells. Normal red blood cells survivefor approximately 120 days in the bloodstream; sicklecells last only 10–12 days. As a result, the bloodstream ischronically short of red blood cells and hemoglobin, andthe affected individual develops anemia.\\nSickle cells can create other complications. Due to\\ntheir shape, they do not fit well through small blood ves-sels. As an aggravating factor, the outside surfaces ofsickle cells may have altered chemical properties thatincrease the cells’ ‘stickiness’. These sticky sickle cellsare more likely to adhere to the inside surfaces of smallblood vessels, as well as to other blood cells. As a resultof the sickle cells’ shape and stickiness, blockages formin small blood vessels. Such blockages prevent oxy-genated blood from reaching areas where it is needed,causing pain as well as organ and tissue damage.\\nThe severity of symptoms cannot be predicted based\\nsolely on the genetic inheritance. Some individuals withsickle cell disease develop health- or life-threateningproblems in infancy, but others may have only mildsymptoms throughout their lives. Individuals may experi-\\nence varying degrees of health at different stages in thelife cycle. For the most part, this clinical variability isunpredictable, and the reasons for the observed variabili-ty can not usually be determined. However, certain typesof sickle cell disease (i.e. SC disease) tend to result infewer and less severe symptoms on average than othertypes of sickle cell disease (i.e. SS disease). Some addi-tional modifying factors are known. For example, elevat-ed levels of fetal hemoglobin in a child or adult candecrease the quantity and severity of some symptomsand complications. Fetal hemoglobin is a normallyoccurring hemoglobin that usually decreases from over90% of the total hemoglobin to under 1% during the firstyear of life. This change is genetically determined,although some individuals may experience elevated lev-els of fetal hemoglobin due to variation in the genes thatcontrol fetal hemoglobin production. Such individualsoften experience a reduction in their symptoms and com-plications due to the ability of fetal hemoglobin to pre-vent the polymerization of sickle hemoglobin, whichleads to sickling of the red blood cell.\\nThere are several symptoms that warrant immediate\\nmedical attention, including the following:\\n• signs of infection ( fever greater than 101°F or 38.3°C,\\ncoughs frequently or breathing trouble, unusual cranki-ness, feeding difficulties)\\n• signs of severe anemia (pale skin or lips, yellowing of\\nthe skin or eyes, very tired, very weak)\\n• signs indicating possible dehydration (vomiting, diar-\\nrhea , fewer wet diapers)\\n• other signs (pain or swelling in the abdomen, swollen\\nhands or feet, screams when touched)\\nThese can be signs of various complications that\\noccur in sickle cell disease.\\nInfections and effects on the spleen\\nChildren with sickle cell disease who are under age\\nthree are particularly prone to life-threatening bacterialinfections. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most com-\\nmon offending bacteria, and invasive infection from thisorganism leads to death in 15% of cases. The spleen, an\\norgan that helps to fight bacterial infections, is particular-ly vulnerable to the effects of sickling. Sickle cells canimpede blood flow through the spleen, causing organdamage, which usually results in loss of spleen functionby late childhood. The spleen can also become enlargeddue to blockages and/or increased activity of the spleen.Rapid enlargement of the spleen may be a sign of anothercomplication called splenic sequestration , which occurs\\nmostly in young children and can be life-threatening.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3042Sickle cell diseaseGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3042'),\n",

The fre-quency and duration of the pain can vary tremendouslyfrom person to person and over an individual’s lifecycle.Painful events are the most common cause of hospitaliza-tions in sickle cell disease. However, only a small portionof individuals with sickle cell disease experience fre-quent and severe painful events. Most painful events canbe managed at home. Pain results when small blood ves-sel blockages prevent oxygen from reaching tissues. Paincan affect any area of the body, although the extremities,chest, abdomen, and bones are frequently affected sites.There is some evidence that cold temperatures or infec-tion can trigger a painful event, but most events occur forunknown reasons. The hand-foot syndrome, or dactylitis ,\\nis a particular type of painful event. Most common intoddlers, dactylitis results in pain and swelling in thehands and feet, sometimes accompanied by a fever.\\nAnemia\\nSickle cells have a high turnover rate leading to a\\ndeficit of red blood cells in the bloodstream. Commonsymptoms of anemia include fatigue , paleness, and a\\nshortness of breath . A particularly severe form of ane-\\nmia—aplastic anemia—occurs following infection withparvovirus. Parvovirus causes extensive destruction ofthe bone marrow, bringing production of new red bloodcells to a halt. Bone marrow production resumes afterseven to 10 days; however, given the short lives of sicklecells, even a brief shut-down in red blood cell productioncan cause a rapid decline in hemoglobin concentrations.\\nDelayed growth\\nThe energy demands of the bone marrow for red\\nblood cell production compete with the demands of agrowing body. Children with sickle cell anemia mayhave delayed growth and reach puberty at a later age\\nthan normal. By early adulthood, they catch up ongrowth and attain normal height; however, weight typi-cally remains below average.\\nStroke\\nChildren with sickle cell disease have a significantly\\nelevated risk of having a stroke , which can be one of the\\nmost concerning complications of sickle cell disease.Approximately 11% of individuals with sickle cell dis-ease will have a recognizable stroke by the age of 20.\\nMagnetic resonance imaging studies have found that\\n17% of children with sickle cell anemia have evidence ofa previous stroke or clinically ‘silent’ stroke-like eventscalled transient ischemic events . Stroke in sickle cell dis-\\nease is usually caused by a blockage of a blood vessel,but about one fourth of the time may be caused by a hem-orrhage (or rupture) of a blood vessel.\\nStrokes result in compromised delivery of oxygen to\\nan area of the brain. The consequences of stroke can rangefrom life-threatening, to severe physical or cognitiveimpairments, to apparent or subtle learning disabilities, toundetectable effects. Common stroke symptoms includeweakness or numbness that affects one side of the body,sudden behavioral changes, loss of vision, confusion, lossof speech or the ability to understand spoken words, dizzi-\\nness,headache , seizures, vomiting, or even coma .\\nApproximately two-thirds of the children who have\\na stroke will have at least one more. Transfusions havebeen shown to decrease the incidence of a second stroke.A recent study showed that children at highest risk toexperience a first stroke were 10 times more likely tostroke if untreated when compared to high-risk childrentreated with chronic blood transfusion therapy. High-\\nrisk children were identified using transcranial dopplerultrasound technology to detect individuals withincreased blood flow speeds due to constricted intracra-nial blood vessels.\\nAcute Chest Syndrome\\nAcute chest syndrome (ACS) is a leading cause of\\ndeath for individuals with sickle cell disease, and recur-rent attacks can lead to permanent lung damage.

Affected persons may experience fever,\\ncough , chest pain, and shortness of breath. ACS seems to\\nhave multiple causes including infection, sickling in thesmall blood vessels of the lungs, fat embolisms to thelungs, or a combination of factors.\\nPriapism\\nMales with sickle cell anemia may experience pri-\\napism , a condition characterized by a persistent and\\npainful erection of the penis. Due to blood vessel block-age by sickle cells, blood is trapped in the tissue of thepenis. Priapism may be short in duration or it may beprolonged. Priapism can be triggered by low oxygen(hypoxemia), alcohol consumption, or sexual inter-course. Since priapism can be extremely painful andresult in damage to this tissue causing impotence , rapid\\ntreatment is essential.\\nKidney disease\\nThe environment in the kidney is particularly prone\\nto damage from sickle cells. Signs of kidney damage caninclude blood in the urine, incontinence, and enlargedkidneys. Adults with sickle cell disease often experienceinsufficient functioning of the kidneys, which canprogress to kidney failure in a small percentage of adultswith sickle cell disease.\\nJaundice and gallstones\\nJaundice is indicated by a yellow tone in the skin\\nand eyes, and alone it is not a health concern. Jaundicemay occur if bilirubin levels increase, which can occurwith high levels of red blood cell destruction. Bilirubin isthe final product of hemoglobin degradation, and is typi-cally removed from the bloodstream by the liver. There-fore, jaundice can also be a sign of a poorly functioningliver, which may also be evidenced by an enlarged liver.Increased bilirubin also leads to increased chance forgallstones in children with sickle cell disease. Treatment,\\nwhich may include removal of the gall bladder, may beselected if the gallstones start causing symptoms.\\nRetinopathy\\nThe blood vessels that supply oxygen to the retina—\\nthe tissue at the back of the eye—may be blocked bysickle cells, leading to a condition called retinopathy.This is one of the only complications that is actuallymore common in SC disease as compared to SS disease.Retinopathy can be identified through regular ophthal-mology evaluations and effectively treated in order toavoid damage to vision.Joint problems\\nAvascular necrosis of the hip and shoulder joints, in\\nwhich bone damage occurs due to compromised bloodflow due to sickling, can occur later in childhood. Thiscomplication can affect an individual’s physical abilitiesand result in substantial pain.\\nDiagnosis\\nInheritance of sickle cell disease or trait cannot be\\nprevented, but it may be predicted. Screening is recom-mended for individuals in high-risk populations. In theUnited States, African Americans and Latino Americanshave the highest risk of having the disease or trait. Sicklecell is also common among individuals of Mediter-ranean, Middle Eastern, and Eastern Indian descent.\\nA complete blood count (CBC) will describe several\\naspects of an individual’s blood cells. A person with sick-le cell disease will have a lower than normal hemoglobinlevel, together with other characteristic red blood cellabnormalities. A hemoglobin electrophoresis is a test that\\ncan help identify the types and quantities of hemoglobinmade by an individual. This test uses an electric fieldapplied across a slab of gel-like material. Hemoglobinsmigrate through this gel at various rates and to specificlocations, depending on their size, shape, and electricalcharge. Although sickle hemoglobin (Hb S) and regularadult hemoglobin (called Hb A) differ by only one aminoacid, they can be clearly separated using hemoglobin\\nelectrophoresis . Isoelectric focusing and high-perfor-\\nmance liquid chromatography (HPLC) use similar princi-\\nples to separate hemoglobins and can be used instead ofor in various combinations with hemoglobin elec-trophoresis to determine the types of hemoglobin present.\\nAnother test called the ‘sickledex’ can help confirm\\nthe presence of sickle hemoglobin, although this test can-not provide accurate or reliable diagnosis when usedalone. When Hb S is present, but there is an absence oronly a trace of Hb A, sickle cell anemia is a likely diag-nosis. Additional beta globin DNA testing , which looks\\ndirectly at the beta globin gene, can be performed to helpconfirm the diagnosis and establish the exact genetictype of sickle cell disease. CBC and hemoglobin elec-trophoresis are also typically used to diagnose sickle celltrait and various other types of beta globin traits.\\nDiagnosis of sickle cell disease can occur under var-\\nious circumstances. If an individual has symptoms thatare suggestive of this diagnosis, the above-describedscreening tests can be performed followed by DNA test-ing, if indicated. Screening at birth using HPLC or arelated technique offers the opportunity for early inter-vention.

This allows for early identification and treatment.Hemoglobin trait screening is recommended for anyindividual of a high-risk ethnic background who may beconsidering having children. When both members of acouple are found to have sickle cell trait, or other relatedhemoglobin traits, they can receive genetic counseling\\nregarding the risk of sickle cell disease in their futurechildren and various testing options.\\nSickle cell disease can be identified before birth\\nthrough the use of prenatal diagnosis. Chorionic villus\\nsampling (CVS) can be offered as early as 10 weeks of\\npregnancy and involves removing a sample of the placen-ta made by the baby and testing the cells. CVS carries arisk of causing a miscarriage that is between one-half to\\none percent.\\nAmniocentesis is generally offered between 15 and\\n22 weeks of pregnancy, but can sometimes be offered ear-lier. Two to three tablespoons of the fluid surrounding thebaby is removed. This fluid contains fetal cells that can betested. This test carries a risk of causing a miscarriage,which is not greater than 1%. Pregnant woman and cou-ples may choose prenatal testing in order to prepare forthe birth of a baby that may have sickle cell disease.Alternately, knowing the diagnosis during pregnancyallows for the option of pregnancy termination.\\nPreimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is a rela-\\ntively new technique that involves in-vitro fertilizationfollowed by genetic testing of one cell from each devel-\\noping embryo. Only the embryos unaffected by sicklecell disease are transferred back into the uterus. PGD iscurrently available on a research basis only, and is rela-tively expensive.\\nTreatment\\nThere are several practices intended to prevent some\\nof the symptoms and complications of sickle cell disease.These include preventative antibiotics , good hydration,\\nimmunizations, and access to comprehensive care. Main-taining good health through adequate nutrition , avoiding\\nstresses and infection, and getting proper rest is alsoimportant. Following these guidelines is intended toimprove the health of individuals with sickle cell disease.\\nPenicillin\\nInfants are typically started on a course of penicillin\\nthat extends from infancy to age six. Use of this antibiot-ic is meant to ward off potentially fatal infections. Infec-tions at any age are treated aggressively with antibiotics.Vaccines for common infections, such as pneumococcal\\npneumonia , are also recommended.Pain management\\nPain is one of the primary symptoms of sickle cell ane-\\nmia, and controlling it is an important concern. The meth-ods necessary for pain control are based on individual fac-tors. Some people can gain adequate pain control throughover-the-counter oral painkillers ( analgesics ). Other indi-\\nviduals, or painful events, may require stronger methodswhich can include administration of narcotics. Alternativetherapies may be useful in avoiding or controlling pain,including relaxation, hydration, avoiding extremes of tem-perature, and the application of local warmth.\\nBlood transfusions\\nBlood transfusions are not usually given on a regular\\nbasis but are used to treat individuals with frequent andsevere painful events, severe anemia, and other emergen-cies. In some cases blood transfusions are given as a pre-ventative measure, for example to treat spleen enlarge-ment or prevent a second stroke (or a first stroke in anindividual shown to be at high risk).\\nRegular blood transfusions have the potential to\\ndecrease formation of hemoglobin S, and reduce associ-ated symptoms. However, there are limitations and risksassociated with regular blood transfusions, including therisk of blood-borne infection and sensitization to proteinsin the transfused blood that can make future transfusionsvery difficult. Most importantly, chronic blood transfu-sions can lead to iron overload. The body tends to storeexcess iron, such as that received through transfusions, invarious organs. Over time, this iron storage can causedamage to various tissues and organs, such as the heartand endocrine organs.\\nSome of this damage can be prevented by the admin-\\nistration of a medication called desferoxamine that helps\\nthe body to eliminate excess iron through the urine.Alternately, some individuals receive a new, non-stan-dard treatment called erythrocytapheresis . This involves\\nthe automated removal of sickle cells and is used in con-junction with a reduced number of regular transfusions.This treatment helps to reduce iron overload.\\nHydroxyurea\\nEmphasis is being placed on developing drugs that\\ntreat sickle cell anemia directly. The most promising ofthese drugs in the late 1990s is hydroxyurea, a drug thatwas originally designed for anticancer treatment. Hydrox-yurea has been shown to reduce the frequency of painfulcrises and acute chest syndrome in adults, and to lessenthe need for blood transfusions. Hydroxyurea, and otherrelated medications, seem to work by inducing a higherproduction of fetal hemoglobin. The major side effects of\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3046Sickle cell diseaseGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3046'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 751}, page_content='the drug include decreased production of platelets, red\\nblood cells, and certain white blood cells. The effects oflong-term hydroxyurea treatment are unknown.\\nBone marrow transplantation\\nBone marrow transplantation has been shown to\\ncure sickle cell anemia in some cases. This treatment isreserved primarily for severely affected children with ahealthy donor whose marrow proteins match those of therecipient, namely a brother or sister who has inheritedthe same tissue type. Indications for a bone marrowtransplant are stroke, recurrent acute chest syndrome,and chronic unrelieved pain.\\nBone marrow transplantations tend to be the most\\nsuccessful in children; adults have a higher rate of trans-plant rejection and other complications. There is approxi-mately a 10% fatality rate associated with bone marrowtransplants done for sickle cell disease. Survivors facepotential long-term complications, such as chronic graft-versus-host disease (an immune-mediated attack by thedonor marrow against the recipient’s tissues), infertility ,\\nand development of some forms of cancer . A relatively\\nrecent advance in transplantation involves the use of donorstem cells obtained from cord blood , the blood from the\\nplacenta that is otherwise discarded following the birth ofa new baby. Cord blood cells, as opposed to fully maturebone marrow cells, appear to be less likely to result ingraft-versus-host disease in the recipient. This increasesthe safety and efficacy of the transplant procedure.\\nSurgery\\nCertain surgical interventions are utilized in the\\ntreatment of specific sickle cell-related complications.Removal of a dysfunctioning gallbladder or spleen canoften lead to improvements in health. Investigations arecurrently underway to establish the efficacy of hip coringsurgery, in which a portion of affected bone is removedto treat avascular necrosis of the hip. The hope is that thismay provide an effective treatment to alleviate some painand restore function in the affected hip.\\nPsychosocial support\\nAs in any lifelong, chronic disease, comprehensive\\ncare is important. Assistance with the emotional, social,family-planning, economic, vocational, and other conse-quences of sickle cell disease can enable affected individ-uals to better access and benefit from their medical care.\\nPrognosis\\nSickle cell disease is characteristically variable\\nbetween and within affected individuals. Predicting thecourse of the disorder based solely on genes is not possi-\\nble. Several factors aside from genetic inheritance deter-mine the prognosis for affected individuals, including thefrequency, severity, and nature of specific complications inany given individual. The availability and access of com-prehensive medical care also plays an important role inpreventing and treating serious, acute complications,which cause the majority of sickle cell-related deaths. Forthose individuals who do not experience such acute events,life-expectancy is probably substantially greater than theaverage for all people with sickle cell disease. The impactof recent medical advances supports the hypothesis thatcurrent life-expectancies may be significantly greater thanthose estimated in the early 1990s. At that time, individu-als with SS disease lived to the early- to mid-40s, andthose with SC disease lived into the upper 50s on average .\\nWith early detection and comprehensive medical care,most people with sickle cell disease are in fairly goodhealth most of the time. Most individuals can be expectedto live well into adulthood, enjoying an improved qualityof life including the ability to choose a variety of educa-tion, career, and family-planning options for themselves.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBeutler, Ernest. “The Sickle Cell Diseases and Related Disor-\\nders.” In Williams Hematology, edited by Ernest Beutler,\\net al. 5th ed.

Abnormal, iron-saturated red cells arepresent in the blood of people who have this disease.Although the iron circulates normally from the plasma tothe bone marrow, where new red blood cells are created,it is not properly incorporated into new red blood cells.\\nSideroblastic anemia can be inherited, but the dis-\\nease is usually acquired as a result of illness or exposureto toxic substances.\\nSideroblastic anemia is a disease of adults.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of sideroblastic anemia cannot always be\\nidentified. Drug toxicity, alcohol abuse, and lead poison-\\ningare common causes of this condition.Sideroblastic anemia is also associated with:\\n• leukemia\\n• lymphoma ( cancer of the lymph glands)\\n• myeloma (cancer of the bone marrow)• rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory diseases\\nSymptoms of sideroblastic anemia are the same as\\nsymptoms of the disease that causes the condition, aswell as anemia.\\nComplications\\nPossible complications of sideroblastic anemia\\ninclude:\\n• congestive heart failure\\n• diabetes mellitus• enlargement of the liver and spleen\\n• formation of liver nodules and scar tissue\\n• irregular heartbeat• recurring inflammation of the sac that surrounds the\\nheart\\n• secondary hypopituitarism (dwarfism)\\n• skin darkening\\n• underactivity of the thyroid gland\\nDiagnosis\\nBlood tests are used to examine the appearance and\\nother characteristics of red cells and to measure theamount of iron in the blood. Bone marrow biopsy is alsoused.\\nTreatment\\nAcquired sideroblastic anemia may be cured when\\nthe condition that causes it is treated or removed.\\nIf the cause of a patient’s anemia cannot be deter-\\nmined, blood transfusions may be necessary. Medica-tions are prescribed to stimulate excretion or excess ironthat accumulates as a result of these transfusions.\\nIn rare instances, treatment with oral pyridoxine (a\\nB-complex vitamin) benefits patients whose sideroblasticanemia was present at birth. This treatment improves thecondition of some patients but does not cure the anemia.\\nPrognosis\\nSideroblastic anemia of unknown origin may lead to\\nleukemia. It may take as long as 10 years for this diseaseprogression to take place.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3048Sideroblastic anemiaGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3048'),\n",

It is also used for the diagnosis of inflammato-ry bowel disease and other benign diseases of the lowerintestine.\\nCancer of the rectum and colon is the second most\\ncommon cancer in the United States, and claims the livesof approximately 60,000 people annually. As a result,cancer authorities now recommend that people over 50be screened for colorectal cancer every three to fiveyears. Screening at an earlier age should be done onpatients who have a family history of colon or rectal\\ncancer , or small growths in the colon (polyps).\\nIndividuals with inflammatory bowel disease\\n(Crohn’s colitis or ulcerative colitis ) are at increasedrisk for colorectal cancer and should begin their screen-\\nings at a younger age, and be screened more frequently.Many doctors screen such patients more often than everythree to five years. Those with ulcerative colitis shouldbe screened beginning 10 years after the onset of disease;those with Crohn’s colitis beginning 15 years after theonset of disease.\\nSome doctors prefer to do this screening with a\\ncolonoscope, which allows them to see the entire colon(certain patients, such as those with Crohn’s colitis orulcerative colitis, must be screened with a colono-scope). However, compared with sigmoidoscopy,colonoscopy is a longer process, causes more discom-\\nfort, and is more costly.\\nStudies have indicated that about one quarter of all\\nprecancerous or small cancerous growths in the colorec-tal region can be seen with a rigid sigmoidoscope. Thelonger, flexible version, which is the primary type of sig-moidoscope used in the screening process, can detectmore than half of all growths in this region. This exami-nation is usually performed in combination with a fecal\\noccult blood test , in an effort to increase detection of\\npolyps and cancers that lie beyond the scope’s reach.\\nPrecautions\\nSigmoidoscopy can usually be conducted in a doc-\\ntor’s office or a health clinic. However, some individualsshould have the procedure done in a hospital day surgeryfacility. These include patients with rectal bleeding, andpatients whose blood does not clot well (possibly as aresult of blood-thinning medications).\\nDescription\\nMost sigmoidoscopy is done with a flexible fiber-\\noptic tube. The tube contains a light source and a cameralens. The doctor moves the sigmoidoscope up beyond therectum (the first 1 ft/30 cm of the colon), examining theinterior walls of the rectum. If a 2 ft/60 cm scope is used,the next portion of the colon can also be examined forany irregularities.\\nThe procedure takes 20 to 30 minutes, during which\\ntime the patient will remain awake. Light sedation may\\nbe given to some patients. There is some discomfort(usually bloating and cramping) because air is injectedinto the bowel to widen the passage for the sigmoido-scope. Pain is rare except in individuals with active\\ninflammatory bowel disease.\\nIn a colorectal cancer screening, the doctor is looking\\nfor polyps or tumors. Studies have shown that over time,many polyps develop into cancerous lesions and tumors.Using instruments threaded through the fiber-optic tube,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3049SigmoidoscopyGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3049'),\n",

People who have can-cerous polyps removed can be referred for full colonoscopy,or more frequent sigmoidoscopy, as necessary.\\nThe doctor may also look for signs of ulcerative coli-\\ntis, which include a loss of blood flow to the lining of thebowel, a thickening of the lining, and sometimes a dis-charge of blood and pus mixed with stool. The doctor canalso look for Crohn’s disease , which often appears as\\nshallow or deep ulcerations, or erosions and fissures inthe lining of the colon. In many cases, these signs appearin the first few centimeters of the colon above the rectum,and it is not necessary to do a full colonoscopic exam.\\nPrivate insurance plans often cover the cost of sigmoi-\\ndoscopy for screening in healthy individuals over 50, or fordiagnostic purposes. Medicare covers the cost for diagnos-tic exams, and may cover the costs for screening exams.\\nPreparation\\nThe purpose of preparation for sigmoidoscopy is to\\nclean the lower bowel of stool so that the doctor can seethe lining. Many patients are required to consume only\\nclear liquids on the day before the test, and to take twoenemas on the morning of the procedure. The bowel is\\ncleaner, however, if patients also take an oral laxativepreparation of 1.5 oz phospho-soda the evening beforethe sigmoidoscopy.\\nCertain medications should be avoided for a week\\nbefore having a sigmoidoscopy. These include:\\n• aspirin, or products containing aspirin\\n• ibuprofin products (Nuprin, Advil, or Motrin)\\n• iron or vitamins containing iron\\nAlthough most prescription medication can be taken\\nas usual, patients should check with their doctor inadvance.\\nAftercare\\nPatients may feel mild cramping after the procedure\\nthat will improve after passing gas. Patients can resumetheir normal activities almost immediately.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3050Sigmoidoscopy\\nSigmoidoscopy is a procedure most often used in screening for colorectal cancer and as a test in diagnosis of possible\\ninflammatory bowel disease. As illustrated above, the physician can view the rectum and colon through a sigmoidoscope, a12 inch (30 cm) or 24 inch (60 cm) flexible fiber-optic tube which contains a light source and a lens.

Zonderman\\nSildenafil citrate\\nDefinition\\nSildenafil citrate (Viagra) is a medication used to\\ntreat erectile dysfunction (ED), or impotence , in men.\\nPurpose\\nViagra treats erectile dysfunction, the inability to\\nachieve and/or maintain an erection of the penis that isadequate for sexual intercourse. Ten to fifteen million menin the United States suffer from ED, and by age 65, up to25% of men have experienced impotence problems. Erec-tile dysfunction can be caused by a number of physicaland psychological conditions, including diabetes, depres-sion, prostate cancer ,spinal cord injury ,multiple scle-\\nrosis , artherosclerosis, and heart disease. Injuries to the\\npenis that cause nerve, tissue, or vascular damage can trig-ger impotence. It is also a common side effect of someprescription medications, including antihistamines , anti-\\ndepressants, antihypertensives, antipsychotics, beta\\nblockers ,diuretics , tranquilizers, appetite suppressants,\\ncimetidine (Tagamet), and finasteride (Propecia).\\nAlthough not approved for use in women, clinical\\nstudies have shown that sildenafil citrate may be effec-tive in relieving female sexual dysfunction for some\\nwomen.

Severalstudies have also indicated the drug may be effective inimproving libido and arousal in women taking selectiveserotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\\nAnother investigational study conducted by re-\\nsearchers at Johns Hopkins University School of Medi-cine in Baltimore, and published in the August 2000issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation found that\\nViagra may have additional clinical promise for peoplewith diabetes beyond treating ED. In animal studies, Via-gra was effective in relaxing the pyloric muscle of stom-ach, improving digestion and relieving the symptoms ofgastroparesis. Up to 75% of people with diabetes sufferfrom gastroparesis, which causes bloating, nausea, lossof appetite, and vomiting. Further human studies areneeded to evaluate Viagra’s effectiveness in treating thiscommon diabetic complication.\\nBecause of its capacity to enhance nitric oxide pro-\\nduction, sildenafil has been investigated as a possible treat-ment for other disorders that are caused by impaired nitricoxide production. One such disorder is esophageal motili-ty dysfunction ( achalasia ), in which the smooth muscles\\nof the esophagus and the cardiac sphincter remain con-stricted, causing difficulty in swallowing, regurgitation offood, and chest pain when eating. A study published in\\n2000 in the journal Gastroenterology found that sildenafil\\ntemporarily improved the condition in some patients byrelaxing the lower esophageal muscles.\\nPrecautions\\nViagra is not labeled or approved for use by\\nwomen or children, or by men without erectile dys-function. The medication may also be contraindicated(not recommended for use) in patients with certainmedical conditions.\\nBecause sexual activity can stress the heart, men\\nwho have heart problems should check with their physi-cian to see if sexual activity is recommended. Viagra maytrigger temporary hypotension (low blood pressure) and\\nis known to increase cardiovascular nerve activity, so it isprescribed with caution in men with a history of heart\\nattack , artherosclerosis, angina , arrhythmia, and chronic\\nlow blood pressure problems. However, a study publishedin the March 15, 2001, British Medical Journal found no\\nevidence that the drug causes a higher incidence of heartattack. Further long-term studies are needed to determinethe full implications of sildenafil citrate on heart disease.\\nAnyone experiencing cardiovascular symptoms such\\nas dizziness , chest or arm pain, and nausea when partici-pating in sexual activity after taking Viagra should stop\\nthe encounter. They should also not take Viagra againuntil they have discussed the episode with their health-care provider.\\nIt is recommended that men with kidney or liver\\nimpairments, and men over age 65, start at the lowestpossible dosage of Viagra (25 mg). Clinical studies haveshown that the drug builds up in the plasma of thesepatients to a concentration that is three to eight timeshigher than normal. Caution is also recommended in pre-scribing the drug to individuals with retinitis pigmentosa ,\\na rare genetic eye disorder. Viagra should not be takenmore than once per day by anyone.\\nViagra has not been studied for use on patients with\\nstomach ulcers and bleeding disorders, and its safety inthese individuals is unknown. Men who have either ofthese conditions should let their physician know beforetaking Viagra. It should also be used with caution in menwith misshapen or deformed penises, such as those withPeyronie’s disease , cavernosal fibrosis, or with angula-\\ntion of the penis.\\nMen who take medications containing nitrates (e.g.,\\nnitroglycerin, isosorbide mononitrate, isosorbide dini-trate) should never take Viagra, as the interactionbetween the two drugs may cause a dramatic drop inblood pressure, and possibly trigger a heart attack orstroke .

Silicosisis marked by the formation of lumps (nodules) andfibrous scar tissue in the lungs. It is the oldest knownoccupational lung disease, and is caused by exposure toinhaled particles of silica, mostly from quartz in rocks,sand, and similar substances.\\nDescription\\nIt is estimated that there are two million workers in\\nthe United States employed in occupations at risk for thedevelopment of silicosis. These include miners, foundryworkers, stonecutters, potters and ceramics workers,sandblasters, tunnel workers, and rock drillers. Silicosisis mostly found in adults over 40. It has four forms:\\n• Chronic. Chronic silicosis may take 15 or more years of\\nexposure to develop. There is only mild impairment oflung functioning. Chronic silicosis may progress tomore advanced forms.\\n• Complicated. Patients with complicated silicosis have\\nnoticeable shortness of breath , weight loss, and exten-\\nsive formation of fibrous tissue (fibrosis) in the lungs.These patients are at risk for developing tuberculosis\\n(TB).\\n• Accelerated. This form of silicosis appears after 5-10\\nyears of intense exposure. The symptoms are similar tothose of complicated silicosis. Patients in this groupoften develop rheumatoid arthritis and other autoim-\\nmune disorders .• Acute. Acute silicosis develops within six months to\\ntwo years of intense exposure to silica. The patientloses a great deal of weight and is constantly short ofbreath. These patients are at severe risk of TB.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe precise mechanism that triggers the development\\nof silicosis is still unclear. What is known is that particlesof silica dust get trapped in the tiny sacs (alveoli) in thelungs where air exchange takes place. White blood cellscalled macrophages in the alveoli ingest the silica and die.The resulting inflammation attracts other macrophages tothe region. The nodule forms when the immune systemforms fibrous tissue to seal off the reactive area. The dis-ease process may stop at this point, or speed up anddestroy large areas of the lung. The fibrosis may continueeven after the worker is no longer exposed to silica.\\nEarly symptoms of silicosis include shortness of\\nbreath after exercising and a harsh, dry cough . Patients\\nmay have more trouble breathing and cough up blood asthe disease progresses. Congestive heart failure can give\\ntheir nails a bluish tint. Patients with advanced silicosismay have trouble sleeping and experience chest pain ,\\nhoarseness, and loss of appetite. Silicosis patients are athigh risk for TB, and should be checked for the diseaseduring the doctor’s examination.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of silicosis is based on:\\n• a detailed occupational history.• chest x rays will usually show small round opaque\\nareas in chronic silicosis; the round areas are larger incomplicated and accelerated silicosis\\n• bronchoscopy• lung function tests\\nIt should be noted that the severity of the patient’s\\nsymptoms does not always correlate with x-ray findingsor lung function test results.\\nTreatment\\nSymptom management\\nThere is no cure for silicosis. Therapy is intended to\\nrelieve symptoms, treat complications, and prevent respi-ratory infections. It includes careful monitoring for signsof TB. Respiratory symptoms may be treated with bron-\\nchodilators , increased fluid intake, steam inhalation, and\\nphysical therapy. Patients with severe breathing difficul-ties may be given oxygen therapy or placed on a mechan-ical ventilator.

They should\\nbe encouraged to increase their exercise capacity by\\nkeeping up regular activity, and to learn to pace them-selves with their daily routine.\\nPrognosis\\nSilicosis is currently incurable. The prognosis for\\npatients with chronic silicosis is generally good. Acutesilicosis, however, may progress rapidly to respiratoryfailure and death .\\nPrevention\\nSilicosis is a preventable disease. Preventive occupa-\\ntional safety measures include:\\n• controls to minimize workplace exposure to silica dust\\n• substitution of substances—especially in sandblast-\\ning—that are less hazardous than silica\\n• clear identification of dangerous areas in the workplace\\n• informing workers about the dangers of overexposure to\\nsilica dust, training them in safety techniques, and giv-ing them appropriate protective clothing and equipment\\nCoworkers of anyone diagnosed with silicosis\\nshould be examined for symptoms of the disease.

In sinus endoscopy, the endo-\\nscope is inserted into the nose, and the interior of thenasal passages, sinuses, and throat is examined.\\nPurpose\\nSinus endoscopy is used to help diagnose structural\\ndefects, infection or damage to the sinuses, or structuresin the nose and throat. It may be used to view polyps andgrowths in the sinuses and to investigate causes of recur-rent inflammation of the sinuses ( sinusitis ). During sur-\\ngical procedures, an endoscope may be used to view thearea to correct sinus-drainage problems or to removepolyps from the nose and throat.\\nPrecautions\\nInsertion of the endoscope may cause a gag reflex\\nand some discomfort, however, no special precautionsare required to prepare for nasal endoscopy.\\nDescription\\nThis procedure can be done in a physician’s office.\\nThe endoscope is inserted into a nostril and is threadedthrough the sinus passages to the throat. To make view-ing of these areas easier, and to record the areas beingexamined, a camera, monitor, or other such viewingdevice is connected to the endoscope\\nPreparation\\nFor the procedure, the patient is usually awake and\\nseated upright in a chair. A local anesthetic spray or liq-uid may be applied to the throat to make insertion of theendoscope less uncomfortable.\\nAftercare\\nAfter the endoscope is removed, the patient can\\nreturn to most normal activities. If an anesthetic wasused, the patient may have to wait until the numbnesswears off to be able to eat or drink.\\nRisks\\nThe insertion and removal of the endoscope may\\nstimulate a gag reflex, and can cause some discomfort.The procedure may also irritate the tissues of the noseand throat, causing a nosebleed or coughing.\\nNormal results\\nUnder normal conditions, no polyps, or growths are\\nfound in the sinuses.

The cilia beat constantly, to help\\nmove the mucus produced in the sinuses into the respira-tory tract. The beating cilia sweeping the mucus along therespiratory tract helps to clear the respiratory tract of anydebris, or any organisms which may be present. When thelining of the sinuses is at all swollen, the swelling inter-feres with the normal flow of mucus. Trapped mucus canthen fill the sinuses, causing an uncomfortable sensationof pressure and providing an excellent environment forthe growth of infection-causing bacteria.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSinusitis is almost always due to an infection,\\nalthough swelling from allergies can mimic the symptoms\\nof pressure, pain, and congestion; and allergies can set the\\nstage for a bacterial infection. Bacteria are the most com-mon cause of sinus infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae\\ncauses about 33% of all cases, while Haemophilus influen-\\nzae causes about 25% of all cases. Sinusitis in children\\nmay be caused by Moraxella catarrhalis (20%). In people\\nwith weakened immune systems (including patients withdiabetes; acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or\\nAIDS ; and patients who are taking medications which\\nlower their immune resistance, such as cancer and trans-\\nplant patients), sinusitis may be caused by fungi such asAspergillus ,Candida , or Mucorales.\\nAcute sinusitis usually follows some type of upper\\nrespiratory tract infection or cold. Instead of ending, thecold seems to linger on, with constant or even worseningcongestion. Drainage from the nose often changes from aclear color to a thicker, yellowish-green. There may befever . Headache and pain over the affected sinuses may\\noccur, as well as a feeling of pressure which may worsenwhen the patient bends over. There may be pain in thejaw or teeth. Some children, in particular, get upset stom-achs from the infected drainage going down the back oftheir throats, and being swallowed into their stomachs.Some patients develop a cough .\\nChronic sinusitis occurs when the problem has exist-\\ned for at least three months. There is rarely a fever withchronic sinusitis. Sinus pain and pressure is frequent, asis nasal congestion. Because of the nature of the swellingin the sinuses, they may not be able to drain out the nose.Drainage, therefore, drips constantly down the back ofthe throat, resulting in a continuously sore throat and\\nbad breath .\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is sometimes tricky, because the symp-\\ntoms so often resemble those of an uncomplicated cold.However, sinusitis should be strongly suspected when acold lingers beyond about a week’s time.Medical practitioners have differing levels of trust of\\ncertain basic examinations commonly conducted in theoffice. For example, tapping over the sinuses may causepain in patients with sinusitis, but it may not. A proce-dure called “sinus transillumination” may, or may not,also be helpful. Using a flashlight pressed up against theskin of the cheek, the practitioner will look in thepatient’s open mouth. When the sinuses are full of air(under normal conditions), the light will project throughthe sinus, and will be visible on the roof of the mouth asa lit-up, reddened area. When the sinuses are full ofmucus, the light will be stopped. While this simple testcan be helpful, it is certainly not a perfect way to diag-nose or rule out the diagnosis of sinusitis.\\nX-ray pictures and CT scans of the sinuses are help-\\nful for both acute and chronic sinusitis. People withchronic sinusitis should also be checked for allergies;and they may need a procedure with a scope to see if anykind of anatomic obstruction is causing their illness. Forexample, the septum (the cartilage which separates thetwo nasal cavities from each other) may be slightly dis-placed, called a deviated septum . This can result in\\nchronic obstruction, setting the person up for the devel-opment of an infection.\\nTreatment\\nAntibiotic medications are used to treat acute sinusi-\\ntis. Suitable antibiotics include sulfa drugs, amoxicillin,\\nand a variety of cephalosporins . These medications are\\nusually given for about two weeks, but may be given foreven longer periods of time. Decongestants , or the short-\\nterm use of decongestant nose sprays, can be useful.Acetaminophen and ibuprofen can decrease the pain\\nand headache associated with sinusitis. Also, running ahumidifier can prevent mucus within the nasal passagesfrom drying out uncomfortably, and can help soothe anyaccompanying sore throat or cough.\\nChronic sinusitis is often treated initially with antibi-\\notics. Steroid nasal sprays may be used to decreaseswelling in the nasal passages. If an anatomic reason isfound for chronic sinusitis, it may need to be correctedwith surgery. If a surgical procedure is necessary, samplesare usually taken at the same time to allow identificationof any organisms present which may be causing infection.\\nFungal sinusitis will require surgery to clean out the\\nsinuses. Then, a relatively long course of a very strongantifungal medication called amphotericin B is giventhrough a needle in the vein (intravenously).\\nAlternative treatment\\nChronic sinusitis is often associated with food aller-\\ngies.

Irrigating the\\nsinuses with a salt water solution is often recommendedfor sinusitis and allergies, in order to clear the nasal pas-sages of mucus. Another solution for nasal lavage (wash-ing) utilizes powdered goldenseal ( Hydrastis canaden-\\nsis). Other herbal treatments, taken internally, include a\\nmixture made of eyebright ( Euphrasia officinalis ), gold-\\nenseal, yarrow ( Achillea millefolium ), horseradish, and\\nephedra ( Ephedra sinica ), or, when infection is present, a\\nmixture made of echinacea (Echinacea spp.), wild indi-\\ngo, and poke root ( Phytolacca decandra-Americana ).\\nHomeopathic practitioners find a number of reme-\\ndies useful for treating sinusitis. Among those they rec-ommend are: Arsenicum album ,Kalium bichromium ,\\nNux vomica ,Mercurius iodatus , and Silica .\\nAcupuncture has been used to treat sinusitis, as\\nhave a variety of dietary supplements, including vita-\\nmins A, C, and E, and the mineral zinc. Contrast\\nhydrotherapy (hot and cold compresses, alternating 3\\nminutes hot, 30 seconds cold, repeated 3 times alwaysending with cold) applied directly over the sinuses canrelieve pressure and enhance healing. A direct inhalationof essential oils (2 drops of oil to 2 cups of water) usingthyme, rosemary, and lavender can help open the sinusesand kill bacteria that cause infection.Prognosis\\nPrognosis for sinus infections is usually excellent,\\nalthough some individuals may find that they are particu-larly prone to contracting such infections after a cold. Fun-gal sinusitis, however, has a relatively high death rate.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention involves the usual standards of good\\nhygiene to cut down on the number of colds an individualcatches. Avoiding exposure to cigarette smoke, identifyingand treating allergies, and avoiding deep dives in swim-ming pools may help prevent sinus infections. During thewinter, it is a good idea to use a humidifier. Dry nasal pas-sages may crack, allowing bacteria to enter. When aller-gies are diagnosed, a number of nasal sprays are availableto try to prevent inflammation within the nasal passage-ways, thus allowing the normal flow of mucus.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nDurand, Marlene, et al. “Infections of the Upper Respiratory\\nTract.” In Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine ,e d .\\nAnthony S.

Typically, the heart lies on the left side of thebody ( levocardia ), the liver and spleen lie on the right,\\nand the lung on the left has two lobes while the lung onthe right has three lobes. This normal arrangement isknown as situs solitus .\\nHowever, in about 1 in 8,500 people, the organs of\\nthe chest and abdomen are arranged in the exact oppositeKEY TERMS\\nCilia—Tiny, hair-like projections from a cell. With-\\nin the respiratory tract, the cilia act to move mucusalong, in an effort to continually flush out andclean the respiratory tract.\\nSinus —An air-filled cavity.position: the heart is on the right ( dextrocardia ), as is the\\ntwo-lobed lung, and the liver, spleen, and three-lobedlung are on the left. Yet because this arrangement, calledsitus inversus , is a perfect mirror image, the relationship\\nbetween the organs is not changed, so functional prob-lems rarely occur.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nEarly in the normal development of an embryo, the\\ntube-like structure that becomes the heart forms a looptoward the left, identifying the left/right axis along whichthe other organs should be positioned. Although themechanism that causes the heart loop to go left is notfully understood, at least one gene has been identified tohave a role in this process. However, it is thought thatmany factors may be involved in causing situs inversus.Rarely, situs inversus can run in families, but most oftenit is an isolated and accidental event occurring in an indi-vidual for the first time in the family.\\nMost people with situs inversus have no medical\\nsymptoms or complications resulting from the condition.Although only 3-5% of people with situs inversus haveany type of functional heart defect, this is higher than therate of heart defects in the general population, which isless than 1%.\\nIt is estimated that about 25% of people with situs\\ninversus have an underlying condition called primary cil-iary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD, also known as Kartagener’ssyndrome, is characterized as situs inversus, chronicsinus infections, increased mucous secretions from thelungs, and increased susceptibility to respiratory infec-tions. PCD is caused by a defect in the cilia that impairstheir normal movements.\\nDiagnosis\\nSitus inversus should detected by a thorough physical\\nexamination . It is often picked up when a physician,\\nusing a stethoscope, hears otherwise normal heart soundson the right side of the body instead of the left. To confirmthe a suspected diagnosis of situs inversus, imaging studiessuch as MRI, CT, or ultrasound may be ordered, and areferral may be made to a cardiologist or internist for com-pleteness. Imaging studies will also rule out the possibilityof random arrangement of the organs, or heterotaxy, whichhas a much higher risk for serious medical complications.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no treatment for situs inversus. In the\\nunlikely case that a heart defect is present, it should betreated accordingly by a cardiologist.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3060Situs inversusGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3060'),\n",

Its name comes from the German verb“sitzen,” meaning “to sit.”\\nPurpose\\nA sitz bath is used for patients who have had surgery\\nin the area of the rectum, or to ease the pain of hemor-\\nrhoids , uterine cramps, prostate infections, painful\\novaries, and/or testicles. It is also used to ease discomfortfrom infections of the bladder, prostate, or vagina. Inflam-matory bowel diseases are also treated with sitz baths.\\nPrecautions\\nSome patients may become dizzy when standing up\\nafter sitting in hot water; it is best to have someone elsepresent when doing a contrast sitz bath.\\nDescription\\nThe sitz bath is a European tradition in which only\\nthe pelvis and abdominal area are placed in water, withthe upper body, arms, legs, and feet out of the water. Thewater can be warm or cool and one or two tubs may beused.\\nWarm sitz baths are one of the easiest and most\\neffective ways to ease the pain of hemorrhoids.

Turkington\\nSjögren’s syndrome\\nDefinition\\nSjögren’s syndrome is a disorder where the mouth\\nand eyes become extremely dry. Sjögren’s syndrome isoften associated with other autoimmune disorders .\\nDescription\\nLike other autoimmune disorders, Sjögren’s syn-\\ndrome occurs when the body’s immune system mistaken-ly begins treating parts of the body as foreign invaders.While the immune cells should attack and kill invaderslike bacteria, viruses, and fungi, these cells should notattack the body itself. In autoimmune disorders, however,cells called antibodies see tissues of the body as foreign,and help to start a chain of events that results in damageand destruction of those tissues.\\nThere are three types of Sjögren’s syndrome. Prima-\\nry Sjögren’s syndrome occurs by itself, with no otherassociated disorders. Secondary Sjögren’s syndromeoccurs along with other autoimmune disorders, like sys-\\ntemic lupus erythematosus ,rheumatoid arthritis ,scle-\\nroderma ,vasculitis , or polymyositis . When the disorder\\nis limited to involvement of the eyes, with no other organor tissue involvement evident, it is called sicca complex.\\nWomen are about nine times more likely to suffer\\nfrom Sjögren’s syndrome than are men. It affects all agegroups, although most patients are diagnosed when theyare between 40 and 55 years old. Sjögren’s syndrome iscommonly associated with other autoimmune disorders.In fact, 30% of patients with certain autoimmune disor-ders will also have Sjögren’s syndrome.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of Sjögren’s syndrome has not been clearly\\ndefined, but several causes are suspected. The syndromesometimes runs in families. Other potential causes includehormonal factors (since there are more women than menwith the disease) and viral factors. The viral theory sug-gests that the immune system is activated in response to aviral invader, but then fails to turn itself off. Some otherimmune malfunction then causes the overly activeimmune system to begin attacking the body’s own tissues.\\nThe main problem in Sjögren’s syndrome is dryness.\\nThe salivary glands are often attacked and slowlydestroyed, leaving the mouth extremely dry and sticky.Swallowing and talking become difficult. Normally, thesaliva washes the teeth clean. Saliva cannot perform thisfunction in Sjögren’s syndrome, so the teeth developmany cavities and decay quickly. The parotid glands pro-duce the majority of the mouth’s saliva. They are locatedlying over the jaw bones behind the area of the cheeksand in front of the ears, and may become significantlyenlarged in Sjögren’s syndrome.\\nThe eyes also become extremely dry as the tear\\nglands (called glands of lacrimation) are slowly destroyed.Eye symptoms include itching , burning, redness,\\nincreased sensitivity to light, and thick secretions gather-ing at the eye corners closest to the nose. The cornea mayhave small irritated pits in its surface (ulcerations).\\nDestruction of glands in other areas of the body may\\ncause a variety of symptoms. In the nose, dryness mayresult in nosebleeds. In the rest of the respiratory tract,the rates of ear infection, hoarseness, bronchitis , and\\npneumonia may increase. Vaginal dryness can be quite\\nuncomfortable. Rarely, the pancreas may slow produc-tion of enzymes important for digestion. The kidney maymalfunction. About 33% of all patients with Sjögren’ssyndrome have other symptoms unrelated to glanddestruction. These symptoms include fatigue , decreased\\nenergy, fevers, muscle aches and pains, and joint pain .\\nPatients who also have other autoimmune diseases\\nwill suffer from the symptoms specific to those conditions.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of Sjögren’s syndrome is based on the\\npatient having at least three consecutive months of both-ersome eye and/or mouth dryness. A variety of tests canthen be done to determine the quantity of tears produced,the quantity of saliva produced, and the presence orabsence of antibodies that could be involved in thedestruction of glands.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no cure for Sjögren’s syndrome. Instead,\\ntreatment usually attempts to reduce the discomfort andcomplications associated with dryness of the eyes and\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3063Sjögren’s syndromeGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3063'),\n",

By usingthese types of products, the patient is more comfortableand avoids the complications associated with eyes thatare overly dry. Dry mouth is treated by sipping fluids\\nslowly but constantly throughout the day. Sugarlesschewing gum can also be helpful. An artificial saliva isavailable for use as a mouthwash. Careful dental hygieneis important in order to avoid tooth decay , and it is wise\\nfor patients to decrease sugar intake. Vaginal dryness canbe treated with certain gel preparations. Steroid medica-tions may be required when other symptoms of autoim-mune disorders complicate Sjögren’s syndrome. Howev-er, these medications should be avoided when possiblebecause they may make the cornea thin and even moresusceptible to injury.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for patients with primary Sjögren’s\\nsyndrome is particularly good.

Thedoctor can usually substitute another anesthetic agent.\\nDescription\\nThe first part of the skin biopsy test is obtaining a\\nsample of tissue that best represents the lesion beingevaluated. Many biopsy techniques are available. Thechoice of technique and precise location from which totake the biopsy material are determined by factors suchas the type and shape of the lesion. Biopsies can be clas-sified as excisional or incisional. In excisional biopsy, thelesion is completely removed; in incisional biopsy, a por-tion of the lesion is removed.\\nThe most common biopsy techniques are:\\n• Shave biopsy. A scalpel or razor blade is used to shave\\noff a thin layer of the lesion parallel to the skin.\\n• Punch biopsy. A small cylindrical punch is screwed into\\nthe lesion through the full thickness of the skin and aplug of tissue is removed. A stitch or two may be need-ed to close the wound.\\n• Scalpel biopsy. A scalpel is used to make a standard\\nsurgical incision or excision to remove tissue. Thistechnique is most often used for large or deep lesions.The wound is closed with stitches.\\n• Scissors biopsy. Scissors are used to snip off surface\\n(superficial) skin growths and lesions that grow from astem or column of tissue. Such growths are sometimesseen on the eyelids or neck.\\nAfter the biopsy tissue is removed, bleeding may be\\ncontrolled by applying pressure or by burning with elec-tricity or chemicals.

Placek\\nSkin cancer seeMelanoma\\nSkin cancer, non-melanoma\\nDefinition\\nNon-melanoma skin cancer is a malignant growth\\nof the external surface or epithelial layer of the skin.\\nDescription\\nSkin cancer is the growth of abnormal cells capable\\nof invading and destroying other associated skin cells.Skin cancer is often subdivided into either melanoma ornon-melanoma. Melanoma is a dark-pigmented, usuallymalignant tumor arising from a skin cell capable ofmaking the pigment melanin (a melanocyte). Non-melanoma skin cancer most often originates from theexternal skin surface as a squamous cell carcinoma or abasal cell carcinoma.The cells of a cancerous growth originate from a sin-\\ngle cell that reproduces uncontrollably, resulting in theformation of a tumor. Exposure to sunlight is document-ed as the main cause of almost 800,000 cases of non-melanoma skin cancer diagnosed each year in the UnitedStates. The incidence increases for those living wheredirect sunshine is plentiful, such as near the equator.\\nBasal cell carcinoma affects the skin’s basal layer\\nand has the potential to grow progressively larger in size,although it rarely spreads to distant areas (metastasizes).Basal cell carcinoma accounts for 80% of skin cancers(excluding melanoma), whereas squamous cell cancermakes up about 20%. Squamous cell carcinoma is amalignant growth of the external surface of the skin.Squamous cell cancers metastasize at a rate of 2-6%,with up to 10% of lesions affecting the ear and lip.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCumulative sun exposure is considered a significant\\nrisk factor for non-melanoma skin cancer. There is evi-dence suggesting that early, intense exposure causingblistering sunburn in childhood may also play an impor-\\ntant role in the cause of non-melanoma skin cancer. Basalcell carcinoma most frequently affects the skin of face,with next most common sites being the ears, the backs ofthe hands, the shoulders, and the arms. It is prevalent inboth sexes and most commonly occurs in people over 40.\\nBasal cell carcinoma usually appears as a small skin\\nlesion that persists for at least three weeks. This form ofnon-melanoma looks flat and waxy, with the edges of thelesion translucent and rounded. The edges also containsmall, fresh blood vessels. An ulcer found in the centergives the lesion a dimpled appearance. Basal cell carci-noma lesions vary from 0.16–0.2 (4–6 mm) in size, butcan slowly grow larger if untreated.\\nSquamous cell carcinoma also involves skin exposed\\nto the sun, such as the face, ears, hands or arms. Thisform of non-melanoma is also most common among peo-ple over 40. Squamous cell carcinoma presents itself as asmall, scaling, raised bump on the skin with a crustingulcer in the center, but without pain and itching .\\nBasal cell and squamous cell carcinomas can grow\\nmore easily when people have a suppressed immune sys-tem because they are taking immunosuppressive drugs orare exposed to radiation. Some people must takeimmunosuppressive drugs to prevent the rejection of atransplanted organ or because they have a disease inwhich the immune system attacks the body’s own tissues(autoimmune illnesses); others may need radiation ther-\\napy to treat another form of cancer. Because of this,\\neveryone taking these immunosuppressive drugs or\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3066Skin cancer, non-melanomaGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3066'),\n",

If proper treatmentis delayed and the tumor continues to grow, the tumorcells can spread (metastasize) to muscle, bone, nerves,and possibly the brain.\\nDiagnosis\\nTo diagnose skin cancer, doctors must carefully\\nexamine the lesion and ask the patient about how long ithas been there, whether it itches or bleeds, and otherquestions about the patient’s medical history. If skin can-cer cannot be ruled out, a sample of the tissue is removedand examined under a microscope (a biopsy). A definitivediagnosis of squamous or basal cell cancer can only bemade with microscopic examination of the tumor cells.Once skin cancer has been diagnosed, the stage of the dis-ease’s development is determined. The information fromthe biopsy and staging allows the physician and patient toplan for treatment and possible surgical intervention.\\nTreatment\\nA variety of treatment options are available for those\\ndiagnosed with non-melanoma skin cancer. Some carci-nomas can be removed by cryosurgery, the process offreezing with liquid nitrogen. Uncomplicated and previ-ously untreated basal cell carcinoma of the trunk andarms is often treated with curettage and electrodesicca-tion, which is the scraping of the lesion and the destruc-tion of any remaining malignant cells with an electricalcurrent. Removal of a lesion layer-by-layer down to nor-mal margins (Moh’s surgery) is an effective treatment forboth basal and squamous cell carcinoma. Radiation ther-apy is best reserved for older, debilitated patients orwhen the tumor is considered inoperable. Laser therapyis sometimes useful in specific cases; however, this formof treatment is not widely used to treat skin cancer.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative medicine aims to prevent, rather than\\ntreat, skin cancer. Vitamins have been shown to prevent\\nsunburn and, possibly, skin cancer. Some dermatologistshave suggested that taking vitamins E and C may helpprevent sunburn. In one particular study, men and womentook these vitamins for eight days prior to being exposedto ultraviolet light. The researchers found that those whoconsumed vitamins required about 20% more ultravioletlight to induce sunburn than did people who didn’t takevitamins. This is the first study that indicates the oral useof vitamins E and C increases resistance to sunburn.These antioxidants are thought to reduce the risk of skincancer, and are expected to provide protection from thesun even in lower doses. Other anitoxidant nutrients,\\nincluding beta carotene, selenium, zinc, and the bio-flavonoid quercetin, antioxidant herbs as bilberry ( Vac-\\ncinium myrtillus ), hawthorn ( Crataegus laevigata ),\\ntumeric ( Curcuma longa ), and ginkgo ( Ginkgo biloba )\\nmay also help prevent skin cancer.\\nPrognosis\\nBoth squamous and basal cell carcinoma are curable\\nwith appropriate treatment. Early detection remains criti-cal for a positive prognosis.\\nPrevention\\nAvoiding exposure to the sun reduces the incidence\\nof non-melanoma skin cancer. Sunscreen with a sun-pro-tective factor of 15 or higher is helpful in prevention,along with a hat and clothing to shield the skin from sun\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3067Skin cancer, non-melanoma\\nA close up image of a precancerous mole that could devel-\\nop into a melanoma.

A culture\\nenables a physician to diagnose and treat a skin infection.\\nDescription\\nSeveral groups of microorganisms cause skin infec-\\ntions: bacteria, fungi (molds and yeast), and viruses. Basedon the appearance of the infection, the physician deter-mines what group of microorganisms is likely causing theinfection, then he or she collects a specimen for one ormore types of cultures. A sample of material—such asskin cells, pus, or fluid—is taken from the infection site,placed in a sterile container, and sent to the laboratory. Inthe laboratory, each type of culture is handled differently.\\nBacterial infections are the most common. Bacteria\\ncause lesions, ulcers, cellulitis , and boils . Pyoderma are\\npus-containing skin infections, such as impetigo , caused\\nby Staphylococcus or group A Streptococcus bacteria. To\\nculture bacteria, a portion of material from the infectionsite is spread over the surface of a culture plate andplaced in an incubator at body temperature for one to twodays. Bacteria in the skin sample multiply and appear onthe plates as visible colonies. They are identified by not-ing the appearance of their colonies, and by performingbiochemical tests and a Gram’s stain.\\nThe Gram’s stain is done by smearing part of a colony\\nonto a microscope slide. After it dries, the slide is coloredwith purple and red stains, then examined under a micro-scope. The color of stain picked up and retained by the bac-teria (purple or red), their shape (such as round or rectan-gle), and their size provide valuable clues as to their identity.\\nA sensitivity test, also called antibiotic susceptibility\\ntest, is also done. The bacteria are tested against differentantibiotics to determine which will effectively treat the\\ninfection by killing the bacteria.\\nFungal cultures are done less frequently. A group of\\nfungi called dermatophytes cause a skin infection calledringworm . Yeast causes an infection called thrush. These\\ninfections are usually diagnosed using a method otherthan culture, such as the KOH test . A culture is done only\\nwhen specific identification of the mold or yeast is neces-sary. The specimen is spread on a culture plate designedto grow fungi, then incubated. Several different biochemi-cal tests and stains are used to identify molds and yeasts.\\nViruses, such as herpes, can also cause skin infec-\\ntions. Specimens for viral cultures are mixed with com-mercially-prepared animal cells in a test tube. Character-istic changes to the cells caused by the growing virushelp identify the virus.\\nResults for bacterial cultures are usually available in\\none to three days. Cultures for fungi and viruses maytake longer—up to three weeks.

Wounds that are left to heal on their own can con-tract, often resulting in serious scarring; if the wound islarge enough, the scar can actually prevent movement oflimbs. Non-healing wounds, such as diabetic ulcers,venous ulcers, or pressure sores, can be treated with skingrafts to prevent infection and further progression of thewounded area.\\nPrecautions\\nSkin grafting is generally not used for first- or sec-\\nond-degree burns, which generally heal with little or noscarring. Also, the tissue for grafting and the recipientsite must be as sterile as possible to prevent later infec-tion that could result in failure of the graft.\\nDescription\\nThe skin is the largest organ of the human body. It\\nconsists of two main layers: the epidermis is the outerlayer, sitting on and nourished by the thicker dermis.These two layers are approximately 0.04-0.08 in (1-2mm) thick. The epidermis consists of an outer layer ofdead cells, which provides a tough, protective coating,and several layers of rapidly dividing cells called ker-atinocytes. The dermis contains the blood vessels,nerves, sweat glands, hair follicles, and oil glands. Thedermis consists mainly of connective tissue, primarilythe protein collagen, which gives the skin its flexibilityand provides structural support. Fibroblasts, which makecollagen, are the main cell type in the dermis.\\nSkin protects the body from fluid loss, aids in tem-\\nperature regulation, and helps prevent disease-causingbacteria or viruses from entering the body. Skin that isdamaged extensively by burns or non-healing woundscan compromise the health and well-being of the patient.More than 50,000 people are hospitalized for burn treat-ment each year in the United States, and 5,500 die.Approximately 4 million people suffer from non-healingwounds, including 1.5 million with venous ulcers and800,000 with diabetic ulcers, which result in 55,000amputations per year in the United States.\\nSkin for grafting can be obtained from another area\\nof the patient’s body, called an autograft, if there isenough undamaged skin available, and if the patient ishealthy enough to undergo the additional surgery\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3069Skin graftingGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3069'),\n",

Alternatively, skin can be obtained from anoth-\\ner person (donor skin from cadavers is frozen, stored,and available for use), called an allograft, or from an ani-mal (usually a pig), called a xenograft. Allografts andxenografts provide only temporary covering—they arerejected by the patient’s immune system within seven to10 days and must be replaced with an autograft.\\nA split-thickness skin graft takes mainly the epider-\\nmis and a little of the dermis, and usually heals withinseveral days. The wound must not be too deep if a split-thickness graft is going to be successful, since the bloodvessels that will nourish the grafted tissue must comefrom the dermis of the wound itself.\\nA full-thickness graft involves both layers of the\\nskin. Full-thickness autografts provide better contour,more natural color, and less contraction at the graftedsite. The main disadvantage of full-thickness skin graftsis that the wound at the donor site is larger and requiresmore careful management; often a split-thickness graftmust be used to cover the donor site.\\nA composite skin graft is sometime used, consisting\\nof combinations of skin and fat, skin and cartilage, ordermis and fat. Composite grafts are used where three-dimensional reconstruction is necessary. For example, awedge of ear containing skin and cartilage can be used to\\nrepair the nose.\\nSeveral artificial skin products are available for burns\\nor non-healing wounds. Unlike allographs and xenographs,these products are not rejected by the patient’s body andactually encourage the generation of new tissue. Artificialskin usually consists of a synthetic epidermis and a colla-gen-based dermis. This artificial dermis, the fibers of whichare arranged in a lattice, acts as a template for the formationof new tissue. Fibroblasts, blood vessels, nerve fibers, andlymph vessels from surrounding healthy tissue cross intothe collagen lattice, which eventually degrades as thesecells and structures build a new dermis. The synthetic epi-dermis, which acts as a temporary barrier during thisprocess, is eventually replaced with a split-thickness auto-graft or with an epidermis cultured in the laboratory fromthe patient’s own epithelial cells. The cost for the syntheticproducts in about $1,000 for a 40-in (100-cm) square pieceof artificial skin, in addition to the costs of the surgery.

Most procedures are performed on an outpa-\\ntient basis, using a local anesthetic. Some of the morecomplex procedures may require specialized equipmentavailable only in an outpatient surgery center. Most ofthe procedures are not highly invasive and, frequently,can be well-tolerated by young and old patients, as wellas those with other medical conditions.\\nDescription\\nA variety of techniques are used to remove skin\\nlesions . The particular technique selected will depend on\\nsuch factors as the seriousness of the lesion, its location,and the patient’s ability to tolerate the procedure. Some ofthe simpler techniques, such as a biopsy or cryosurgery,can be performed by a primary care physician. Some ofthe more complex techniques, such as excision with ascalpel, electrosurgery, or laser surgery , are typically per-\\nformed by a dermatologic surgeon, plastic surgeon, orother surgical specialist. Often, the technique selected willdepend on how familiar the physician is with the proce-dure and how comfortable he or she is with performing it.\\nBiopsy\\nIn this procedure, the physician commonly injects a\\nlocal anesthetic at the site of the skin lesion, thenremoves a sample of the lesion, so that a definite diagno-sis can be made. The sample is sent to a pathology labo-ratory, where it is examined under a microscope. Certaincharacteristic skin cells, and their arrangement in theskin, offer clues to the type of skin lesion, and whether itis cancerous or otherwise poses danger. Depending onthe results of the microscopic examination, additionalsurgery may be scheduled.\\nA variety of methods are used to obtain a skin biop-\\nsy. The physician may use a scalpel to cut a piece or\\nremove all of the lesion for examination. Lesions that areconfined to the surface may be sampled with a shavebiopsy, where the physician holds a scalpel blade parallelto the surface of the skin and slides the blade across thebase of the lesion, removing a sample. Some physiciansuse a single-edge razor blade for this, instead of ascalpel. A physician may also perform a punch biopsy, inwhich a small circular punch removes a plug of skin.\\nExcision\\nWhen excising a lesion, the physician attempts to\\nremove it completely by using a scalpel to cut the shapeof an ellipse around the lesion. Leaving an ellipticalwound, rather than a circular wound, makes it easier toinsert stitches. If a lesion is suspected to be cancerous,the physician will not cut directly around the lesion, but\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3072Skin lesion removalGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3072'),\n",

This is to ensure that no cancerous cellsremain, which would allow the tumor to reappear. Toprevent recurrence of basal and squamous cell skin can-cers, experts recommend a margin of 0.08–0.16 in (2–4mm) for malignant melanoma, the margin may be 1.2 in(3 cm) or more.\\nDestruction\\nNot all lesions need to be excised. A physician may\\nsimply seek to destroy the lesion using a number ofdestructive techniques. These techniques do not leavesufficient material to be examined by a pathologist, how-ever, and are best used in cases where a visual diagnosisis certain.\\n• Cryosurgery. This technique employs an extremely cold\\nliquid or instrument to freeze and destroy abnormalskin cells that require removal. Liquid nitrogen is themost commonly used cryogen. It is typically sprayedon the lesion in several freeze-thaw cycles to ensureadequate destruction of the lesion.\\n• Curettage. In this procedure, an instrument with a cir-\\ncular cutting loop at the end is drawn across the lesion,starting at the middle and moving outward. With suc-cessive strokes, the physician scrapes portions of thelesion away. Sometimes a physician will use the curetto reduce the size of the lesion before turning to anothertechnique to finish removing it.\\n• Electrosurgery. This utilizes an alternating current to\\nselectively destroy skin tissue. Depending on the typeof current and device used, physicians may use electro-surgical equipment to dry up surface lesions (elec-trodessication), to burn off the lesion (electrocoagula-tion), or to cut the lesion (electrosection). One advan-tage of electrosurgery is that it minimizes bleeding.\\nMohs’ micrographic surgery\\nThe real extent of some lesions may not be readily\\napparent to the eye, making it difficult for the surgeon todecide where to make incisions. If some cancer cells are\\nleft behind, for example, the cancer may reappear orspread. In a technique called Mohs’ micrographic surgery,surgeons begin by removing a lesion and examining itsmargins under a microscope for evidence of cancer. Ifcancerous cells are found, the surgeon then removesanother ring of tissue and examines the margins again.The process is repeated until the margins appear clear ofcancerous cells. The technique is considered ideal foraggressive tumors in areas such as the nose or upper lip,where an excision with wide margins may be difficult torepair, and may leave a cosmetically poor appearance.Lasers\\nLaser surgery is now applied to a variety of skin\\nlesions, ranging from spider veins to more extensive bloodvessel lesions called hemangiomas. Until recently, CO\\n2\\nlasers were among the more common laser devices usedby physicians, primarily to destroy skin lesions. Otherlasers, such as the Nd:YAG and flashlamp-pumped pulsedye laser have been developed to achieve more selectiveresults when used to treat vascular lesions, such as heman-giomas, or pigmented lesions, such as café-au-lait spots.\\nPreparation\\nNo extensive preparation is required for skin lesion\\nremoval. Most procedures can be performed on an outpa-tient basis with a local anesthetic. The lesion and sur-rounding area is cleaned with an antibacterial compoundbefore the procedure. A sterile operating room is notrequired.\\nAftercare\\nThe amount of aftercare will vary, depending on the\\nskin lesion removal technique. For biopsy, curettage,cryosurgery, and electrosurgery procedures, the patient istold to keep the wound clean and dry. Healing will take atleast several weeks, and may take longer, depending onthe size of the wound and other factors. Healing timeswill also vary with excisions and with Mohs’ micro-graphic surgery, particularly if a skin graft or skin flap isneeded to repair the resulting wound. Laser surgery mayproduce changes in skin coloration that often resolve intime. Pain is usually minimal following most outpatient\\nprocedures, so pain medicines are not routinely pre-scribed. Some areas of the body, such as the scalp andfingers, can be more painful than others, however, and apain medicine may be required.\\nRisks\\nAll surgical procedures present risk of infection.\\nKeeping the wound clean and dry can minimize the risk.Antibiotics are not routinely given to prevent infection\\nin skin surgery, but some doctors believe they have arole. Other potential complications include:\\n• bleeding below the skin, which may create a hematoma\\nand sometimes requires the wound to be reopened anddrained,\\n• temporary or permanent nerve damage resulting from\\nexcision in an area with extensive and shallow nervebranches,\\n• wounds that may reopen after they have been stitched\\nclosed, increasing the risk of infection and scarring.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3073Skin lesion removalGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3073'),\n",

Camer\\nSkin lesions\\nDefinition\\nA skin lesion is a superficial growth or patch of the\\nskin that does not resemble the area surrounding it.\\nDescription\\nSkin lesions can be grouped into two categories: pri-\\nmary and secondary. Primary skin lesions are variationsin color or texture that may be present at birth, such asmoles or birthmarks , or that may be acquired during a\\nperson’s lifetime, such as those associated with infec-tious diseases (e.g., warts ,acne , or psoriasis ), allergic\\nreactions (e.g., hives or contact dermatitis ), or environ-\\nmental agents (e.g., sunburn , pressure, or temperature\\nextremes). Secondary skin lesions are those changes inthe skin that result from primary skin lesions, either as anatural progression or as a result of a person manipulat-ing (e.g., scratching or picking at) a primary lesion.\\nThe major types of primary lesions are:\\n• Macule. A small, circular, flat spot less than 0.4 in (1 cm)\\nin diameter. The color of a macule is not the same as thatof nearby skin. Macules come in a variety of shapes andare usually brown, white, or red. Examples of maculesinclude freckles and flat moles. A macule more than 0.4in (1 cm) in diameter is called a patch.\\n• Vesicle. A raised lesion less than 0.2 in (5 mm) across\\nand filled with a clear fluid. Vesicles that are more than0.2 in (5 mm) across are called bullae or blisters. Theselesions may may be the result of sunburns, insect bites,chemical irritation, or certain viral infections, such asherpes.\\n• Pustule. A raised lesion filled with pus. A pustule is\\nusually the result of an infection, such as acne, impti-geo, or boils .\\n• Papule. A solid, raised lesion less than 0.4 in (1 cm)\\nacross. A patch of closely grouped papules more than0.4 in (1 cm) across is called a plaque. Papules andplaques can be rough in texture and red, pink, or brownin color. Papules are associated with such conditions aswarts, syphilis , psoriasis, seborrheic and actinic ker-\\natoses, lichen planus , and skin cancer .\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3074Skin lesionsGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3074'),\n",

A solid lesion that has distinct edges and that is\\nusually more deeply rooted than a papule. Doctors oftendescribe a nodule as “palpable,” meaning that, whenexamined by touch, it can be felt as a hard mass distinctfrom the tissue surrounding it. A nodule more than 0.8in (2 cm) in diameter is called a tumor. Nodules areassociated with, among other conditions, keratinouscysts, lipomas, fibromas, and some types of lymphomas.\\n• Wheal. A skin elevation caused by swelling that can be\\nitchy and usually disappears soon after erupting.Wheals are generally associated with an allergic reac-tion, such as to a drug or an insect bite.\\n• Telangiectasia. Small, dilated blood vessels that appear\\nclose to the surface of the skin. Telangiectasia is often asymptom of such diseases as rosacea or scleroderma .\\nThe major types of secondary skin lesions are:\\n• Ulcer. Lesion that involves loss of the upper portion of\\nthe skin (epidermis) and part of the lower portion (der-mis). Ulcers can result from acute conditions such asbacterial infection or trauma, or from more chronicconditions, such as scleroderma or disorders involvingperipheral veins and arteries. An ulcer that appears as a\\ndeep crack that extends to the dermis is called a fissure.\\n• Scale. A dry, horny build-up of dead skin cells that\\noften flakes off the surface of the skin. Diseases thatpromote scale include fungal infections, psoriasis, andseborrheic dermatitis .\\n• Crust. A dried collection of blood, serum, or pus. Also\\ncalled a scab, a crust is often part of the normal healingprocess of many infectious lesions.\\n• Erosion. Lesion that involves loss of the epidermis.• Excoriation. A hollow, crusted area caused by scratch-\\ning or picking at a primary lesion.\\n• Scar. Discolored, fibrous tissue that permanently\\nreplaces normal skin after destruction of the dermis. Avery thick and raised scar is called a keloid.\\n• Lichenification. Rough, thick epidermis with exagger-\\nated skin lines. This is often a characteristic of scratchdermatitis and atopic dermatitis .\\n• Atrophy. An area of skin that has become very thin and\\nwrinkled.

A tendency toward developingmoles, freckles, or birthmarks may be inherited. Infec-tion of the skin itself by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or para-sites is the most common cause of skin lesions. Acne,athlete’s foot (tinea pedis), warts, and scabies are exam-\\nples of skin infections that cause lesions. Allergic reac-tions and sensitivity to outside environmental factors canalso lead to the formation of skin lesions. Underlyingconditions can also precipitate the appearance of skinlesions. For example, the decreased sensitivity and poorcirculation that accompanies diabetes mellitus can con-\\ntribute to the formation of extensive ulcers on extremitiessuch as the feet. Infections of body’s entire system cancause the sudden onset of skin lesions. For example, skinlesions are a hallmark symptom of such diseases aschicken pox, herpes, and small pox. Cancers affectingthe skin, including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cellcarcinoma, malignant melanoma , and Kaposi’s sarco-\\nma, are recognized by their lesions.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of the underlying cause of skin lesions is\\nusually based on patient history, characteristics of thelesion, and where and how it appears on the patient’s body(e.g., pustules confined to the face, neck, and upper backcan indicate acne, while scales appearing on the scalp andface may indicate seborrheic dermatitis). To determine thecause of an infection, doctors may also take scrapings orswab samples from lesions for examination under a micro-scope or for use in bacterial, fungal, or viral cultures. Incases where a fungal infection is suspected, a doctor mayexamine a patient’s skin under ultraviolet light using a fil-ter device called a Woods light—under these conditions,certain species will taken on specific fluorescent colors.Dermatologists may also use contrast lighting and sub-dued lighting to detect variations in the skin. Wheninvolvement of the immune system is suspected, doctorsmay order a immunofluorescence test, which detects anti-bodies to specific antigens using a fluorescent chemical. Incases of contact dermatitis, a condition in which a allergicreaction to something irritates the skin, doctors may usepatch tests, in which samples of specific antigens are intro-duced into the skin via a scratch or a needle prick, to deter-mine what substances are provoking the reaction.\\nThe vast majority of skin lesions are noncancerous.\\nHowever, doctors will determine whether or not a partic-ular lesion or lesions are cancerous based on observationand the results of an excisional or punch biopsy, in whicha tissue sample is excised for microscopic analysis. Sinceearly detection is a key to successful treatment, individu-als should examine their skin on a monthly basis for\\nchanges to existing moles, the presence of new moles, ora change in a certain area of skin. When examiningmoles, factors to look for include:\\n• Asymmetry. A normal mole is round, whereas a suspi-\\ncious mole is uneven.\\n• Border. A normal mole has a clear-cut border with the\\nsurrounding skin, whereas the edges of a suspect molemay be irregular.\\n• Color. Normal moles are uniformly tan or brown, but\\ncancerous moles may appear as mixtures of red, white,blue, brown, purple, or black.\\n• Diameter. Normal moles are usually less than 0.2 in (5\\nmm) in diameter, a skin lesion greater than this may besuspected as cancerous.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of skin lesions depends upon the underly-\\ning cause, what type of lesions they are, and the patient’soverall health. If the cause of the lesions is an allergicreaction, removing the allergen from the patient’s environ-ment is the most effective treatment. Topical preparationscan also be used to clean and protect irritated skin as wellas to remove dead skin cells and scales. These may comein a variety of forms, including ointments, creams, lotions,and solutions. Topical antibiotics , fungicides, pediculi-\\ncides (agents that kill lice), and scabicides (agents that killthe scabies parasite) can be applied to treat appropriateskin infections. Oral medications may be taken to addresssystemic infections or conditions. Deeply infected lesionsmay require minor surgery to lance and drain pus. Topicalagents to sooth irritated skin and reduce inflammation mayalso be applied. Corticosteroids are particularly effective\\nin reducing inflammation and itching (puritis). Oatmeal\\nbaths, baking soda mixtures, and calamine lotion are alsorecommended for the relief of these symptoms. A type ofcorticosteroid may be used to reduce the appearance ofkeloid scars. Absorbent powders may also be used toreduce moisture and prevent the spread of infection. Incases of ulcers that are slow to heal, pressure dressingsmay be used. At times, surgical removal of a lesion may berecommended—this is the usual course of therapy for skincancer. Surgical removal usually involves a simple exci-sion under local anesthetic, but it may also be accom-plished through freezing ( cryotherapy ) or laser surgery .\\nPrognosis\\nSkin lesions such as moles, freckles, and birthmarks\\nare a normal part of skin and will not disappear unlessdeliberately removed by a surgical procedure.

Healing of lesions due to\\ninfections or disorders depends upon the type of infectionor disorder and the overall health of the individual. Prog-nosis for skin cancer primarily depends upon whether ornot the lesion is localized and whether or not it has spreadto other areas of the body, such as the lymph nodes. Incases where the lesion is localized and has not spread toother parts of the body, the cure rate is 95–100%.\\nPrevention\\nNot all skin lesions are preventable; moles and freck-\\nles, for example, are benign growths that are common andunavoidable. However others can be avoided or mini-mized by taking certain precautions. Skin lesions causedby an allergic reaction can be avoided by determiningwhat the offending agent is and removing it from thehome or workplace, or, if this is impossible, developingstrategies for safely handling it, such as with gloves andprotective clothing. Keeping the skin, nails, and scalpclean and moisturized can help reduce or prevent the inci-dence of infectious skin diseases, as can not sharing per-sonal care items such as combs and make-up with others.Skin lesions associated with sexually transmitted dis-\\neases can be prevented by the use of condoms. Scratching\\nor picking at existing lesions should be avoided since thisusually serves only to spread infection and may result inscarring. Individuals who have systemic conditions, suchas diabetes mellitus or poor circulation, that could lead toserious skin lesions should inspect their bodies regularlyfor changes in their skin’s condition.

Others, such as age spots,are very common.\\nSkin pigmentation disorders occur because the body\\nproduces either too much or too little melanin, a pigmentthat creates hair, skin, and eye color. Melanin protects thebody by absorbing ultraviolet light.\\nIn hypopigmentation means the body does not pro-\\nduces enough melanin. Albinism, for example, is an inher-ited condition that causes a lack of pigment. So peoplewith albinism typically have light skin, white or pale yel-low hair, and light blue or gray eyes. Another conditioncalled vitilgo, creates smooth, depigmented white spots onthe skin. Vitilgo affects nearly 2% of the population, but itstrikes people between 10 and 30 years old more often,and is more evident in people with darker skin.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3077Skin pigmentation disordersGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3077'),\n",

Melasma can occur during the end of preg-\\nnancy . People with the autoimmune disease (when\\nimmune cells, which attack invaders, become abnormallyprogramed to kill self cells inside the body) systemic lupusalso may develop a similar butterfly-shaped mask on theirfaces. In addition, many people have moles , freckles, age\\nspots, and birthmarks , ranging from red or brown to\\nbluish-black, covering various parts of their bodies.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nScientists are still studying the reasons why skin\\npigmentation disorders occur. In some cases there aretangible causes, such as sun exposure, drug reactions orgenetic inheritance. In other cases, it is not as clear.\\nAlbinism is an inherited recessive trait. Albinism has\\nmany different forms, but most people who have this con-dition have pale skin, hair, and eyes. Melanin also createseye color, and serves as a filter that prevents too muchlight from entering the eye. Since they lack melanin intheir eyes, many people with albinism also have visual\\nimpairment . With little skin pigmentation, they also sun-\\nburn easily and are more prone to skin cancer .\\nThe hypopigmentation spots associated with vitilgo\\nsometimes form where a person has been cut or injured.Research has shown that the light patches associatedwith vitilgo do not contain melanocytes, the type of skincells that create melanin. Some scientists believe vitilgomay be caused by an autoimmune disorder. It also hasbeen linked to other conditions such as hyperthyroidism\\n(too much thyroid hormone) and Addison’s Disease ,\\nwhich affects the adrenal gland.\\nHyperpigmentation can be caused by many factors,\\nfrom too much sunbathing to drug reactions or poor nutri-\\ntion. Wounds and scars also can develop darker patches\\nof skin. A psychological syndrome gives people withlichen simplex chronicus to develop a compulsive need toscratch, which causes dark, leathery skin to form. This canlead to permanent scarring and infection if untreated. Sci-entists believe lamellar ichthyosis is caused by genetics.\\nThe mask caused by melasma may be related to\\npregnancy hormones, and usually disappears after awoman gives birth. Birthmarks, moles, and aging spotsusually are harmless. Some moles, however, can change\\nin size, color, texture, or start bleeding, which could indi-cate possible skin cancer.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnostic tests vary for different types of skin pig-\\nmentation disorders. Physicians usually can diagnosealbinism by looking carefully at a person’s hair, skin, andeyes. They may order blood tests and eye exams as well.A visual exam also is enough to diagnose vitilgo.\\nFor most hyperpigmentation disorders, doctors can\\nmake a diagnosis by looking at a person’s appearance. Todetect conditions like lichen simplex chronicus or lamel-lar ichthyosis, or skin cancer they may also do a biopsy,to remove some of the affected skin for further studyunder a microscope. Some physicians also use a wood’slamp, or black light test, to diagnose skin conditions.Affected areas would absorb the ultraviolet light andstand out with flourescent colors in the darkened room.\\nTreatment\\nFor albinism, health care providers advise people to\\ncover up, use sunscreen and avoid excess sunlight to pre-vent skin cancer. People with albinism also must wearprotective sunglasses and, in some cases, prescriptioncorrective lenses. Surgery may be necessary to correctvisual impairments.\\nTo treat vitilgo, physicians may prescribe a combi-\\nnation of photo-sensitive medications like trimethylpso-ralen and ultraviolet light therapy to darken the spots. Ifthe person has depigmented patches covering more than50% of the body, doctors also may be able to use skinbleaching agents like monobenzone to give the skin alighter, more uniform appearance. Other options includecosmetic concealers and skin grafting .\\nSkin-lightening creams are available for hyperpig-\\nmentation disorders. Doctors also advise staying out ofthe sun. Counseling with a dietitian may help in casescaused by poor nutrition. For lichen simplex chronicus,doctors could prescribe antihistamines and topical\\nsteroid creams to stop the itching. If a mole or birthmarkappears suspicious, physicians often will surgicallyremove it to prevent skin cancer.\\nPrognosis\\nMost skin pigmentation disorders do not affect a\\nperson’s health, only the outward appearance.\\nPrevention\\nIn most cases, doctors will recommend using sun-\\nscreen and avoiding too much sun exposure.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3078Skin pigmentation disordersGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3078'),\n",

They may also beused as a medical treatment, such as removing large num-bers of certain precancerous lesions called actinic ker-atoses. Physicians sometimes combine techniques, usingdermabrasion or laser resurfacing on some areas of theface, while performing a chemical peel on other areas.\\nPrecautions\\nAs the popularity of skin resurfacing techniques has\\nincreased, many unqualified or inexperienced providershave entered the field. Patients should choose theirprovider with the same degree of care they take for anyother medical procedure. Complications of skin resurfac-ing techniques can be serious, including severe infectionand scarring.\\nPatient’s with active herpesvirus infections are not\\ngood candidates for resurfacing procedures. Persons whotend to scar easily may also experience poor results.Patients who have recently used the oral acne medication\\nisotretinoin (Accutane) may be at higher risk of scarringfollowing skin resurfacing.\\nDescription\\nChemical peel\\nChemical peels employ a variety of caustic chemi-\\ncals to selectively destroy several layers of skin. Thepeeling solutions are “painted on,” area-by-area, toensure that the entire face is treated. After the skin heals,discoloration, wrinkles, and other surface irregularitiesare often eliminated.\\nChemical peels are divided into three types: superfi-\\ncial, medium-depth, and deep. The type of peel depends onthe strength of the chemical used, and on how deeply itpenetrates. Superficial peels are used for fine wrinkles, sundamage, acne, and rosacea . The medium-depth peel is\\nused for more obvious wrinkles and sun damage, as well asfor precancerous lesions like actinic keratoses. Deep peelsare used for the most severe wrinkling and sun damage.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3079Skin resurfacingGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3079'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 784}, page_content='Dermabrasion\\nDermabrasion uses an abrasive tool to selectively\\nremove layers of skin. Some physicians use a hand-heldmotorized tool with a small wire brush or diamond-impregnated grinding wheel at the end. Other physiciansprefer to abrade the skin by hand with an abrasive pad orother instrument. Acne scarring is one of the prime usesfor dermabrasion. It also can be used to treat wrinkling,remove surgical scars, and obliterate tattoos.\\nLaser resurfacing\\nLaser resurfacing is the most recently developed\\ntechnique for skin resurfacing. Specially designed,pulsed CO\\n2lasers can vaporize skin layer-by-layer, caus-\\ning minimal damage to other skin tissue. Special scan-ning devices move the laser light across the skin in pre-determined patterns, ensuring proper exposure. Wrin-kling around the eyes, mouth, and cheeks are the primaryuses for laser resurfacing. Smile lines or those associatedwith other facial muscles tend to reappear after laserresurfacing. Laser resurfacing appears to achieve its bestresults as a spot treatment; patients expecting completeelimination of their wrinkles will not be satisfied.\\nPreparation\\nChemical peel\\nPreparation for the chemical peel begins several\\nweeks before the actual procedure. To promote turnoverof skin cells, patients use a mild glycolic acid lotion orcream in the morning, and the acne cream tretinoin in theevening. They also use hydroquinone cream, a bleachingproduct that helps prevent later discoloration. To preventreappearance of a herpes simplex virus infection, antivi-ral medicine is started a few days before the procedureand continues until the skin has healed.\\nPatients arrive for the procedure wearing no makeup.\\nThe physician “degreases” the patient’s face using alco-hol or another cleanser. Some degree of pain accompa-\\nnies all types of peels. For a superficial peel, use of a handheld fan to cool the face during the procedure is often suf-ficient. For medium-depth peels, the patient may take asedative or aspirin . During the procedure, cold compress-\\nes and a hand-held fan can also reduce pain. Deep peelscan be extremely painful. Some physicians prefer generalanesthesia, but local anesthetics combined with intra-venous sedatives are frequently sufficient to control pain.\\nDermabrasion\\nDermabrasion does not require much preparation. It\\nis usually performed under local anesthesia, althoughsome physicians use intravenous sedation or general\\nanesthesia. The physician begins by marking the areas tobe treated and then chilling them with ice packs. In orderto stiffen the skin, a spray refrigerant is applied to thearea, which also helps control pain. Some physicians pre-fer to inject the area with a solution of saline and localanesthetic, which also leaves the skin’s surface moresolid. Since dermabrasion can cause quite a bit of bleed-ing, physicians and their assistants will wear gloves,gowns, and masks to protect themselves from possibleblood-transmitted infection.\\nLaser resurfacing\\nAntiviral medications should be started several days\\nbefore the procedure. Laser resurfacing is performedunder local anesthesia. An oral sedative may also betaken. The patient’s eyes must be shielded, and the areasurrounding the face should be shielded with wet drapesor crumpled foil to catch stray beams of laser light. Thephysician will mark the areas to be treated before begin-ning the procedure.\\nAftercare\\nChemical peel\\nWithin a day or so following a superficial peel, the\\nskin will turn faint pink or brown. Over the next fewdays, dead skin will peel away. Patients will be instructedto wash their skin frequently with a mild cleanser andcool water, then apply an ointment to the skin to keep itmoist. After a medium-depth peel, the skin turns deep redor brown, and crusts may form. Care is similar to thatfollowing a superficial peel. Redness may persist for aweek or more. Deep-peeled skin will turn brown andcrusty. There may also be swelling and some oozing offluid. Frequent washing and ointments are favored overdressings. The skin typically heals in about two weeks,but redness may persist.\\nDermabrasion\\nFollowing the procedure, an ointment may be\\napplied, and the wound will be covered with a dressingand mask. Patients with a history of herpesvirus infec-tions will begin taking an antiviral medication to preventa recurrence. After 24 hours, the dressing is removed,and ointment is reapplied to keep the wound moist.Patients are encouraged to wash their face with plainwater and reapply ointment every few hours. Thisrelieves itching and pain and helps remove oozing fluid\\nand other matter. Patients may require a pain medication.A steroid medication may be taken during the first fewdays to reduce swelling. The skin will take a week ormore to heal, but may remain very red.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3080Skin resurfacingGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3080'),\n",

In either case, care of the skin is similar to that givenfollowing a chemical peel. The face is washed with plainwater to remove ooze, and an ointment is reapplied. Heal-ing will take approximately two weeks. Pain medicationsand a steroid to reduce swelling may also be taken.\\nRisks\\nAll resurfacing procedures can lead to infection and\\nscarring. It is also possible that skin coloration will bealtered, or that redness of the skin will be prolonged formany months.

These studies may also bereferred to as sinus x rays. X-ray studies produce films,also known as radiographs, by aiming x rays at softbones and tissues of the body. X-ray beams are similar tolight waves, except their shorter wavelength allows themto penetrate dense substances, producing images andshadows on film.\\nPurpose\\nDoctors may order skull x rays to aid in the diagno-\\nsis of a variety of diseases or injuries.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3081Skull x raysGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3081'),\n",

Tumors may be benign (notcancerous) or malignant (cancerous).\\nOther\\nBirth defects (referred to as congenital anomalies)\\nmay be detected on a skull x ray by changes in bone struc-ture. Abnormal tissues or glands resulting from various con-ditions or diseases may also be shown on a skull radiograph.\\nPrecautions\\nAs with any x-ray procedure, women who may be\\npregnant are advised against having a skull x ray if it is notabsolutely necessary. However, a lead apron may be worn\\nacross the abdomen during the procedure to protect thefetus. Children are also more sensitive to x-ray exposure.Children of both sexes should wear a protective covering(a lead apron) in the genital/reproductive area. In general,skull x-ray exposure is minimal and x-ray equipment andprocedures are monitored to ensure radiation safety.\\nDescription\\nSkull or sinus x rays may be performed in a doctor’s\\noffice that has x-ray equipment and a technologist avail-able. The exam may also be performed in an outpatientradiology facility or a hospital radiology department.\\nIn many instances, particularly for sinus views, the\\npatient will sit upright in a chair, perhaps with the headheld stable by a foam vise. A film cassette is locatedbehind the patient. The x-ray tube is in front of thepatient and may be moved to allow for different positionsand views. A patient may also be asked to move his orher head at various angles and positions.\\nIn some cases, technologists will ask the patient to lie\\non a table and will place the head and neck at variousangles. In routine skull x rays, as many as five differentviews may be taken to allow a clear picture of variousbones and tissues. The length of the test will vary depend-ing on the number of views taken, but in general, it shouldlast about 10 minutes. The technologist will usually ask apatient to wait while the films are being developed toensure that they are clear before going to the radiologist.\\nPreparation\\nThere is no preparation for the patient prior to arriv-\\ning at the radiology facility. Patients will be asked toremove jewelry, dentures, or other metal objects that mayproduce artifacts on the film.

Sleep apnea is amajor, though often unrecognized, cause of daytimesleepiness.\\nDescription\\nA sleeping person normally breathes continuously\\nand uninterruptedly throughout the night. A person withsleep apnea, however, has frequent episodes (up to400–500 per night) in which he or she stops breathing.This interruption of breathing is called “apnea.” Breath-ing usually stops for about 30 seconds; then the personusually startles awake with a loud snort and begins tobreathe again, gradually falling back to sleep.\\nThere are two forms of sleep apnea. In obstructive\\nsleep apnea (OSA), breathing stops because tissue in thethroat closes off the airway. In central sleep apnea, (CSA),the brain centers responsible for breathing fail to sendmessages to the breathing muscles. OSA is much morecommon than CSA. It is thought that about 1–10% ofadults are affected by OSA; only about one tenth of thatnumber have CSA. OSA can affect people of any age andof either sex, but it is most common in middle-aged, some-what overweight men, especially those who use alcohol.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nObstructive sleep apnea\\nObstructive sleep apnea occurs when part of the air-\\nway is closed off (usually at the back of the throat) whilea person is trying to inhale during sleep. People whoseairways are slightly narrower than average are more like-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3083Sleep apneaGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3083'),\n",

Obesity , especially obesity in\\nthe neck, can increase the risk of developing OSA,because the fat tissue tends to narrow the airway. In somepeople, the airway is blocked by enlarged tonsils, anenlarged tongue, jaw deformities, or growths in the neckthat compress the airway. Blocked nasal passages mayalso play a part in some people.\\nWhen a person begins to inhale, the expansion of the\\nlungs lowers the air pressure inside the airway. If the mus-cles that keep the airway open are not working hardenough, the airway narrows and may collapse, shuttingoff the supply of air to the lungs. OSA occurs during sleepbecause the neck muscles that keep the airway open arenot as active then. Congestion in the nose can make col-lapse more likely, since the extra effort needed to inhalewill lower the pressure in the airway even more. Drinkingalcohol or taking tranquilizers in the evening worsens thissituation, because these cause the neck muscles to relax.(These drugs also lower the “respiratory drive” in the ner-vous system, reducing breathing rate and strength.)\\nPeople with OSA almost always snore heavily,\\nbecause the same narrowing of the airway that causessnoring can also cause OSA. Snoring may actually help\\ncause OSA as well, because the vibration of the throattissues can cause them to swell. However, most peoplewho snore do not go on to develop OSA.\\nCentral sleep apnea\\nIn central sleep apnea, the airway remains open, but\\nthe nerve signals controlling the respiratory muscles are notregulated properly. This can cause wide fluctuations in thelevel of carbon dioxide (CO\\n2) in the blood. Normal activity\\nin the body produces CO2, which is brought by the blood to\\nthe lungs for exhalation. When the blood level of CO2rises,\\nbrain centers respond by increasing the rate of respiration,clearing the CO\\n2. As blood levels fall again, respiration\\nslows down. Normally, this interaction of CO2and breath-\\ning rate maintains the CO2level within very narrow limits.\\nCSA can occur when the regulation system becomes insen-sitive to CO\\n2levels, allowing wide fluctuations in both CO2\\nlevels and breathing rates. High CO2levels cause very rapid\\nbreathing (hyperventilation), which then lowers CO 2so\\nmuch that breathing becomes very slow or even stops. CSAoccurs during sleep because when a person is awake,breathing is usually stimulated by other signals, includingconscious awareness of breathing rate.\\nA combination of the two forms is also possible, and\\nis called “mixed sleep apnea.” Mixed sleep apneaepisodes usually begin with a reduced central respiratorydrive, followed by obstruction.\\nOSA and CSA cause similar symptoms. The most\\ncommon symptoms are:• daytime sleepiness\\n• morning headaches\\n• a feeling that sleep is not restful\\n• disorientation upon waking\\nSleepiness is caused not only by the frequent inter-\\nruption of sleep, but by the inability to enter long periodsof deep sleep, during which the body performs numerousrestorative functions. OSA is one of the leading causes ofdaytime sleepiness, and is a major risk factor for motorvehicle accidents. Headaches and disorientation arecaused by low oxygen levels during sleep, from the lackof regular breathing.\\nOther symptoms of sleep apnea may include sexual\\ndysfunction , loss of concentration, memory loss, intel-\\nlectual impairment, and behavioral changes includinganxiety and depression.\\nSleep apnea can also cause serious changes in the\\ncardiovascular system. Daytime hypertension (high\\nblood pressure) is common. An increase in the number ofred blood cells (polycythemia) is possible, as is anenlarged left ventricle of the heart ( cor pulmonale ), and\\nleft ventricular failure. In some people, sleep apnea caus-es life-threatening changes in the rhythm of the heart,including heartbeat slowing (bradycardia), racing (tachy-cardia), and other types of “arrhythmias.” Sudden death\\nmay occur from such arrhythmias . Patients with the\\nPickwickian syndrome (named after a Charles Dickens\\ncharacter) are obese and sleepy, with right heart failure ,\\npulmonary hypertension , and chronic daytime low\\nblood oxygen (hypoxemia) and increased blood CO\\n2\\n(hypercapnia).\\nDiagnosis\\nExcessive daytime sleepiness is the complaint that\\nusually brings a person to see the doctor. A careful med-ical history will include questions about alcohol or tran-quilizer use, snoring (often reported by the person’s part-ner), and morning headaches or disorientation. A physi-cal exam will include examination of the throat to lookfor narrowing or obstruction. Blood pressure is also mea-sured. Measuring heart rate or blood levels of oxygenand CO\\n2during the daytime will not usually be done,\\nsince these are abnormal only at night in most patients.\\nConfirmation of the diagnosis usually requires mak-\\ning measurements while the person sleeps. These testsare called a polysomnography study, and are conducted\\nduring an overnight stay in a specialized sleep laboratory.Important parts of the polysomnography study includemeasurements of:\\n• Heart rate\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3084Sleep apneaGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3084'),\n",

The home-based study usually includes ear oximetry and cardiacmeasurements. If these measurements support the diag-nosis of OSA, initial treatment is usually suggested with-out polysomnography. Home-based measurements arenot used to rule out OSA, however, and if the measure-ments do not support the OSA diagnosis, polysomnogra-phy may be needed to define the problem further.\\nBoth types of studies are usually covered by insur-\\nance with the appropriate referral from a physician.Without insurance, lab-based polysomnography costapproximately $1,500 in 1997, while overnight homemonitoring cost between $500 and $1,000.\\nTreatment\\nBehavioral changes\\nTreatment of obstructive sleep apnea begins with\\nreducing the use of alcohol or tranquilizers in theevening, if these have been contributing to the problem.Weight loss is also effective, but if the weight returns, asit often does, so does the apnea. Changing sleeping posi-tion may be effective; snoring and sleep apnea are bothmost common when a person sleeps on his back. Turningto sleep on the side may be enough to clear up the symp-toms. Raising the head of the bed may also help. Open-ing of the nasal passages can provide some relief. Thereare a variety of nasal devices such as clips, tapes, orholders which may help, though discomfort may limittheir use. Nasal decongestants may be useful, but should\\nnot be taken for sleep apnea without the consent of thetreating physician.\\nOxygen and drug therapy\\nSupplemental nighttime oxygen can be useful for\\nsome people with either central and obstructive sleepapnea. Tricyclic antidepressant drugs such as protripty-\\nline (Vivactil) may help by increasing the muscle tone ofthe upper airway muscles, but their side effects mayseverely limit their usefulness.Mechanical ventilation\\nFor moderate to severe sleep apnea, the most suc-\\ncessful treatment is nighttime use of a ventilator, calleda CPAP machine. CPAP (continuous positive airwaypressure) blows air into the airway continuously, pre-venting its collapse. CPAP requires the use of a nasalmask. The appropriate pressure setting for the CPAPmachine is determined by polysomnography in the sleeplab. Its effects are dramatic; daytime sleepiness usuallydisappears within one to two days after treatmentbegins. CPAP is used to treat both obstructive and cen-tral sleep apnea.\\nCPAP is tolerated well by about two-thirds of\\npatients who try it. Bilevel positive airway pressure(BiPAP), is an alternative form of ventilation. WithBiPAP, the ventilator reduces the air pressure when theperson exhales. This is more comfortable for some.\\nSurgery\\nSurgery can be used to correct the obstruction in\\nthe airways. The most common surgery is called UPPP,for uvulopalatopharngyoplasty. This surgery removestissue from the rear of the mouth and top of the throat.The tissues removed include parts of the uvula (the flapof tissue that hangs down at the back of the mouth), thesoft palate, and the pharynx. Tonsils and adenoids areusually removed in this operation. This operation sig-nificantly improves sleep apnea in slightly more thanhalf of all cases.\\nReconstructive surgery is possible for those whose\\nOSA is due to constriction of the airway by lower jawdeformities.\\nWhen other forms of treatment are not successful,\\nobstructive sleep apnea may be treated by a tracheosto-my. In this procedure, an opening is made into the tra-chea (windpipe) below the obstruction, and a tube insert-ed to maintain an air passage. A tracheostomy requires agreat deal of care to prevent infection of the tracheosto-my site. In addition, since air is no longer being filteredand moistened by the nasal passages before entering thelungs, the lower airways can become dry and susceptibleto infection as well. Tracheostomy is usually reserved forthose whose apnea has led to life-threatening heartarrhythmias, and who have not been treated successfullywith other treatments.\\nPrognosis\\nThe combination of behavioral changes, ventilation\\nassistance, drug therapy, and surgery allow most peoplewith sleep apnea to be treated successfully, although itmay take some time to determine the most effective and\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3085Sleep apneaGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3085'),\n",

There are about70 different sleep disorders. To qualify for the diagnosisof sleep disorder, the condition must be a persistentproblem, cause the patient significant emotional dis-tress, and interfere with his or her social or occupation-al functioning. \\nAlthough sleep is a basic behavior in animals as well\\nas humans, researchers still do not completely under-stand all of its functions in maintaining health. In the past30 years, however, laboratory studies on human volun-teers have yielded new information about the differenttypes of sleep. Researchers have learned about the cycli-cal patterns of different types of sleep and their relation-ships to breathing, heart rate, brain waves, and otherphysical functions. These measurements are obtained bya technique called polysomnography .\\nThere are five stages of human sleep. Four stages\\nhave non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, withunique brain wave patterns and physical changes occur-ring. Dreaming occurs in the fifth stage, during rapid eyemovement (REM) sleep.\\n• Stage 1 NREM sleep. This stage occurs while a person\\nis falling asleep. It represents about 5% of a normaladult’s sleep time.\\n• Stage 2 NREM sleep. In this stage, (the beginning of\\n“true” sleep), the person’s electroencephalogram (EEG)will show distinctive wave forms called sleep spindlesand K complexes. About 50% of sleep time is stage 2REM sleep.\\n• Stages 3 and 4 NREM sleep. Also called delta or slow\\nwave sleep, these are the deepest levels of human sleepand represent 10–20% of sleep time. They usuallyoccur during the first 30–50% of the sleeping period.\\n• REM sleep. REM sleep accounts for 20–25% of total\\nsleep time. It usually begins about 90 minutes after theperson falls asleep, an important measure called REMlatency. It alternates with NREM sleep about everyhour and a half throughout the night. REM periodsincrease in length over the course of the night.\\nSleep cycles vary with a person’s age. Children and\\nadolescents have longer periods of stage 3 and stage 4NREM sleep than do middle aged or elderly adults.Because of this difference, the doctor will need to take a\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3086Sleep disordersGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:17 PM  Page 3086'),\n",

Total REM sleep also declines with age.\\nThe average length of nighttime sleep varies among\\npeople. Most people sleep between seven and nine hoursa night. This population average appears to be constantthroughout the world. In temperate climates, however,people often notice that sleep time varies with the sea-sons. It is not unusual for people in North America andEurope to sleep about 40 minutes longer per night duringthe winter.\\nDescription\\nSleep disorders are classified based on what causes\\nthem. Primary sleep disorders are distinguished fromthose that are not caused by other mental disorders, pre-scription medications, substance abuse, or medical con-ditions. The two major categories of primary sleep disor-ders are the dyssomnias and the parasomnias.\\nDyssomnias\\nDyssomnias are primary sleep disorders in which\\nthe patient suffers from changes in the amount, restful-ness, and timing of sleep. The most important dyssom-nia is primary insomnia , which is defined as difficulty\\nin falling asleep or remaining asleep that lasts for atleast one month. It is estimated that 35% of adults in theUnited States experience insomnia during any givenyear, but the number of these adults who are experienc-ing true primary insomnia is unknown. Primary insom-nia can be caused by a traumatic event related to sleepor bedtime, and it is often associated with increasedphysical or psychological arousal at night. People whoexperience primary insomnia are often anxious aboutnot being able to sleep. The person may then associateall sleep-related things (their bed, bedtime, etc.) withfrustration, making the problem worse. The person thenbecomes more stressed about not sleeping. Primaryinsomnia usually begins when the person is a youngadult or in middle age.\\nHypersomnia is a condition marked by excessive\\nsleepiness during normal waking hours. The patient haseither lengthy episodes of daytime sleep or episodes ofdaytime sleep on a daily basis even though he or she issleeping normally at night. In some cases, patients withprimary hypersomnia have difficulty waking in themorning and may appear confused or angry. This condi-tion is sometimes called sleep drunkenness and is morecommon in males. The number of people with primaryhypersomnia is unknown, although 5-10% of patients insleep disorder clinics have the disorder. Primary hyper-somnia usually affects young adults between the agesof 15 and 30.Nocturnal myoclonus and restless legs syndrome\\n(RLS) can cause either insomnia or hypersomnia in adults.Patients with nocturnal myoclonus wake up because ofcramps or twitches in the calves. These patients feel sleepythe next day. Nocturnal myoclonus is sometimes calledperiodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). RLS patientshave a crawly or aching feeling in their calves that can berelieved by moving or rubbing the legs. RLS often pre-vents the patient from falling asleep until the early hoursof the morning, when the condition is less intense.\\nKleine-Levin syndrome is a recurrent form of hyper-\\nsomnia that affects a person three or four times a year. Doc-tors do not know the cause of this syndrome. It is markedby two to three days of sleeping 18–20 hours per day,hypersexual behavior, compulsive eating, and irritability.Men are three times more likely than women to have thesyndrome. Currently there is no cure for this disorder.\\nNarcolepsy is a dyssomnia characterized by recur-\\nrent “sleep attacks” that the patient cannot fight. Thesleep attacks are about 10–20 minutes long. The patientfeels refreshed by the sleep, but typically feels sleepyagain several hours later. Narcolepsy has three majorsymptoms in addition to sleep attacks: cataplexy, halluci-\\nnations , and sleep paralysis . Cataplexy is the sudden loss\\nof muscle tone and stability (“drop attacks”). Hallucina-tions may occur just before falling asleep (hypnagogic) orright after waking up (hypnopompic) and are associatedwith an episode of REM sleep. Sleep paralysis occursduring the transition from being asleep to waking up.About 40% of patients with narcolepsy have or have hadanother mental disorder. Although narcolepsy is oftenregarded as an adult disorder, it has been reported in chil-dren as young as three years old. Almost 18% of patientswith narcolepsy are 10 years old or younger. It is estimat-ed that 0.02–0.16% of the general population suffer fromnarcolepsy. Men and women are equally affected.\\nBreathing-related sleep disorders are syndromes in\\nwhich the patient’s sleep is interrupted by problems withhis or her breathing. There are three types of breathing-related sleep disorders:\\n• Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. This is the most\\ncommon form of breathing-related sleep disorder,marked by episodes of blockage in the upper airwayduring sleep. It is found primarily in obese people.Patients with this disorder typically alternate betweenperiods of snoring or gasping (when their airway is\\npartly open) and periods of silence (when their airwayis blocked). Very loud snoring is a clue to this disorder.\\n• Central sleep apnea syndrome. This disorder is primari-\\nly found in elderly patients with heart or neurologicalconditions that affect their ability to breathe properly.

This disor-\\nder is found most often in extremely obese people. Thepatient’s airway is not blocked, but his or her bloodoxygen level is too low.\\n• Mixed-type sleep apnea syndrome. This disorder com-\\nbines symptoms of both obstructive and central sleepapnea.\\nCircadian rhythm sleep disorders are dyssomnias\\nresulting from a discrepancy between the person’s dailysleep/wake patterns and demands of social activities, shiftwork, or travel. The term circadian comes from a Latinword meaning daily. There are three circadian rhythmsleep disorders. Delayed sleep phase type is characterizedby going to bed and arising later than most people. Jet lag\\ntype is caused by travel to a new time zone. Shift worktype is caused by the schedule of a person’s job. Peoplewho are ordinarily early risers appear to be more vulnera-ble to jet lag and shift work-related circadian rhythm dis-orders than people who are “night owls.” There are somepatients who do not fit the pattern of these three disordersand appear to be the opposite of the delayed sleep phasetype. These patients have an advanced sleep phase patternand cannot stay awake in the evening, but wake up ontheir own in the early morning.\\nPARASOMNIAS. Parasomnias are primary sleep dis-\\norders in which the patient’s behavior is affected by spe-cific sleep stages or transitions between sleeping andwaking. They are sometimes described as disorders ofphysiological arousal during sleep.\\nNightmare disorder is a parasomnia in which the\\npatient is repeatedly awakened from sleep by frighteningdreams and is fully alert on awakening. The actual rate ofoccurrence of nightmare disorder is unknown. Approxi-mately 10–50% of children between three and five yearsold have nightmares. They occur during REM sleep, usu-ally in the second half of the night. The child is usuallyable to remember the content of the nightmare and maybe afraid to go back to sleep. More females than maleshave this disorder, but it is not known whether the sex dif-ference reflects a difference in occurrence or a differencein reporting. Nightmare disorder is most likely to occur inchildren or adults under severe or traumatic stress .\\nSleep terror disorder is a parasomnia in which the\\npatient awakens screaming or crying. The patient alsohas physical signs of arousal, like sweating, shaking, etc.It is sometimes referred to as pavor nocturnus. Unlikenightmares, sleep terrors typically occur in stage 3 orstage 4 NREM sleep during the first third of the night.The patient may be confused or disoriented for severalminutes and cannot recall the content of the dream. He or\\nshe may fall asleep again and not remember the episodethe next morning. Sleep terror disorder is most commonin children four to 12 years old and is outgrown in ado-lescence. It affects about 3% of children. Fewer than 1%of adults have the disorder. In adults, it usually beginsbetween the ages of 20 and 30. In children, more malesthan females have the disorder. In adults, men andwomen are equally affected.\\nSleepwalking disorder, which is sometimes called\\nsomnambulism, occurs when the patient is capable ofcomplex movements during sleep, including walking.Like sleep terror disorder, sleepwalking occurs duringstage 3 and stage 4 NREM sleep during the first part ofthe night. If the patient is awakened during a sleepwalk-ing episode, he or she may be disoriented and have nomemory of the behavior. In addition to walking around,patients with sleepwalking disorder have been reportedto eat, use the bathroom, unlock doors, or talk to others.It is estimated that 10–30% of children have at least oneepisode of sleepwalking. However, only 1-5% meet thecriteria for sleepwalking disorder. The disorder is mostcommon in children eight to 12 years old. It is unusualfor sleepwalking to occur for the first time in adults.\\nUnlike sleepwalking, REM sleep behavior disorder\\noccurs later in the night and the patient can rememberwhat they were dreaming. The physical activities of thepatient are often violent.\\nSleep disorders related to other conditions\\nIn addition to the primary sleep disorders, there are\\nthree categories of sleep disorders that are caused by orrelated to substance use or other physical or mental dis-orders.\\nSLEEP DISORDERS RELATED TO MENTAL DISORDERS.\\nMany mental disorders, especially depression or one ofthe anxiety disorders , can cause sleep disturbances.\\nPsychiatric disorders are the most common cause ofchronic insomnia.\\nSLEEP DISORDERS DUE TO MEDICAL CONDITIONS.\\nSome patients with chronic neurological conditions likeParkinson’s disease or Huntington’s disease may devel-\\nop sleep disorders. Sleep disorders have also been associ-ated with viral encephalitis , brain disease, and hypo- or\\nhyperthyroidism .\\nSUBSTANCE-INDUCED SLEEP DISORDERS. The use of\\ndrugs, alcohol, and caffeine frequently produces distur-\\nbances in sleep patterns. Alcohol abuse is associated withinsomnia. The person may initially feel sleepy afterdrinking, but wakes up or sleeps fitfully during the sec-ond half of the night. Alcohol can also increase the sever-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3088Sleep disordersGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3088'),\n",

With ampheta-\\nmines or cocaine , the patient typically suffers from\\ninsomnia during drug use and hypersomnia during drugwithdrawal. Opioids usually make short-term userssleepy. However, long-term users develop tolerance andmay suffer from insomnia.\\nIn addition to alcohol and drugs that are abused, a\\nvariety of prescription medications can affect sleep pat-terns. These medications include antihistamines ,corti-\\ncosteroids ,asthma medicines, and drugs that affect the\\ncentral nervous system.\\nSleep disorders in children and adolescents\\nPediatricians estimate that 20–30% of children have\\ndifficulties with sleep that are serious enough to disturbtheir families. Although sleepwalking and night terrordisorder occur more frequently in children than in adults,children can also suffer from narcolepsy and sleep apneasyndrome.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe causes of sleep disorders have already been dis-\\ncussed with respect to the classification of these disorders.The most important symptoms of sleep disorders are\\ninsomnia and sleepiness during waking hours. Insomniais by far the more common of the two symptoms. It cov-ers a number of different patterns of sleep disturbance.These patterns include inability to fall asleep at bedtime,repeated awakening during the night, and/or inability togo back to sleep once awakened.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of sleep disorders usually requires a psy-\\nchological history as well as a medical history. With theexception of sleep apnea syndromes, physical examina-tions are not usually revealing. The patient’s sex and ageare useful starting points in assessing the problem. Thedoctor may also talk to other family members in order toobtain information about the patient’s symptoms. Thefamily’s observations are particularly important to evalu-ate sleepwalking, kicking in bed, snoring loudly, or otherbehaviors that the patient cannot remember.\\nSleep logs\\nMany doctors ask patients to keep a sleep diary or\\nsleep log for a minimum of one to two weeks in order to\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3089Sleep disorders\\nA patient suffering from acute sleep apnea is hooked up to monitors in preparation for a night’s sleep at a Stanford University\\nsleep lab.

Trazodone, a sedating antidepres-\\nsant, is often used for chronic insomnia that does notrespond to other treatments. Sleep medications may alsocause problems for elderly patients because of possibleinteractions with their other prescription medications.Among the safer hypnotic agents are lorazepam, temaze-pam, and zolpidem. Chloral hydrate is often preferred forshort-term treatment in elderly patients because of itsmildness.

Acupuncture treatments can help bring about\\nbalance and facilitate sleep.\\nDietary changes like eliminating stimulant foods\\n(coffee, cola, chocolate) and late-night meals or snackscan be effective in treating some sleep disorders. Nutri-\\ntional supplementation with magnesium, as well asbotanical medicines that calm the nervous system, canalso be helpful.

Chil-\\ndren usually outgrow sleep disorders. Patients with Kleine-Levin syndrome usually get better around age 40. Narcolep-sy is a life-long disorder. The prognosis for sleep disordersrelated to other conditions depends on successful treatmentof the substance abuse, medical condition, or other mentaldisorder. The prognosis for primary sleep disorders is affect-ed by many things, including the patient’s age, sex, occupa-tion, personality characteristics, family circumstances,neighborhood environment, and similar factors.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBecker, Philip M. “Sleep Disorders.” In Current Diagnosis.\\nV ol. 9.

If left untreated,the infection progresses to death within months or years.\\nDescription\\nProtozoa are single-celled organisms considered to\\nbe the simplest life form in the animal kingdom. The pro-tozoa responsible for sleeping sickness are a variety thatbear numerous flagella (hair-like projections from thecell that help the cell to move). These protozoa exist onlyon the continent of Africa. The type of protozoa causingsleeping sickness in humans is referred to as the Try-\\npanasoma brucei complex, which can be divided further\\ninto Rhodesian (Central and East African) and Gambian(Central and West African) subspecies.\\nThe Rhodesian variety live within antelopes in\\nsavanna and woodland areas, and they cause no problemswith the antelope’s health. The protozoa are thenacquired by tsetse flies when they bite and suck the bloodof an infected antelope or cow.\\nWithin the tsetse fly, the protozoa cycle through sev-\\neral different life forms; ultimately they migrate to thesalivary glands of the tsetse fly. Once the protozoa areharbored in the salivary glands, they are ready to bedeposited into the bloodstream of the fly’s next source ofa blood meal.\\nHumans most likely to become infected by Rhode-\\nsian trypanosomes are people such as game wardens andvisitors to game parks in East Africa, who may be bittenby a tsetse fly that has fed on game (antelope) carryingthe protozoa. The Rhodesian variety of sleeping sicknesscauses a much more severe illness, with even greaterlikelihood of eventual death than the Gambian form.\\nThe Gambian variety of Trypanosoma thrives in\\ntropical rain forests throughout Central and West Africa;it does not infect game or cattle, and is primarily a threatto people dwelling in such areas, rarely infecting visitors.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe first sign of infection with the trypanosome may\\nbe a sore appearing at the site of the tsetse fly bite abouttwo to tree days after having been bitten. Redness, pain ,\\nand swelling occur, but are often ignored by the patient.\\nStage I illness\\nTwo to three weeks later, Stage I disease develops as\\na result of the protozoa being carried through the bloodand lymph circulation of the host. This systemic (mean-ing that symptoms affect the whole body) phase of theillness is characterized by a fever that rises quite high,\\nthen falls to normal, then respikes (rises rapidly). A rashwith intense itching may be present, and headache and\\nmental confusion may occur. The Gambian form, in par-ticular, includes extreme swelling of lymph tissue, withenlargement of both the spleen and liver, and greatlyswollen lymph nodes. “Winterbottom’s sign” is classic ofGambian sleeping sickness, and consists of a visiblyswollen area of lymph nodes located behind the ear andjust above the base of the neck. During this stage, theheart may be affected by a severe inflammatory reaction,particularly when the infection is caused by the Rhode-sian variety of trypanosomiasis.\\nMany of the symptoms of sleeping sickness are actu-\\nally the result of attempts by the patient’s immune sys-tem to get rid of the invading organism. The heightenedactivity of the cells of the immune system result in dam-age to the patient’s own organs, anemia, and leaky bloodvessels. These leaks in the blood vessels end up helpingto further spread the protozoa throughout the afflictedperson’s body.\\nOne reason for the intense reaction of the immune\\nsystem to the presence of the trypanosomes is also thereason why the trypanosomes survive so well despite theefforts of the immune system to eradicate them. The pro-tozoa causing sleeping sickness are able to rapidlychange specific markers (unique proteins) on their outercoats. These kinds of markers usually serve to stimulatethe host’s immune system to produce immune cells thatwill specifically target the marker, allowing quickdestruction of those cells bearing the markers. Try-panosomes, however, are able to express new markers atsuch a high rate of change that the host’s immune systemis constantly trying to catch up.\\nStage II illness\\nStage II sleeping sickness involves the nervous sys-\\ntem. Gambian sleeping sickness, in particular, has aclearly delineated phase in which the predominant symp-toms involve the brain. The patient’s speech becomesslurred, mental processes slow, and the patient sits andstares for long periods of time, or sleeps. Other symp-toms resemble Parkinson’s disease , including imbal-\\nance when walking, slow and shuffling gait, trembling of\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3093Sleeping sicknessGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3093'),\n",

Untreated, these symptomseventually lead to coma and then to death.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of sleeping sickness can be made by\\nmicroscopic examination of fluid from the original soreat the site of the tsetse fly bite. Trypanosomes will bepresent in the fluid for a short period of time followingthe bite. If the sore has already resolved, fluid can beobtained from swollen lymph nodes for examination.Other methods of trypanosome diagnosis involve cultur-ing blood, lymph node fluid, bone marrow, or spinalfluid. These cultures are then injected into rats, whichdevelop blood-borne protozoa infection that can bedetected in blood smears within one to two weeks. How-ever, this last method is effective only for the Rhodesianvariety of sleeping sickness.\\nTreatment\\nWithout treatment, sleeping sickness will lead to\\ndeath. Unfortunately, however, those medications effec-tive against the Trypanosoma brucei complex protozoa all\\nhave significant potential side effects for the patient.Suramin, eflornithine, pentamidine, and several drugs thatcontain arsenic (a chemical, which in higher doses ishighly poisonous to humans), are all effective anti-try-panosomal agents. Each of these drugs, however, requirescareful monitoring to ensure that the drugs themselves donot cause serious complications such as fatal hypersensi-tivity (allergic) reaction, kidney or liver damage, orinflammation of the brain.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention of sleeping sickness requires avoiding\\ncontact with the tsetse fly.

It has three sections: the duodenum (a short, curvedsegment fixed to the back wall of the abdomen), thejejunum, and the ileum (two larger, coiled, and mobilesegments). Some digestion occurs in the stomach, but thesmall intestine is mainly responsible for digestion andabsorption of foods.\\nMalabsorption syndromes occur when certain condi-\\ntions result in impaired absorption of nutrients, vitamins ,\\nor minerals from the diet by the lining of the small intes-\\ntine. For example, injury to the intestinal lining can inter-fere with absorption, as can infections, some drugs,blockage of the lymphatic vessels, poor blood supply tothe intestine, or diseases like sprue.\\nMalabsorption is suspected when a patient not only\\nloses weight, but has diarrhea and nutritional deficien-\\ncies despite eating well (weight loss alone can have othercauses). Laboratory tests like fecal fat, a measurement offat in stool samples collected over 72 hours, are the mostreliable tests for diagnosing fat malabsorption, but abnor-malities of the small intestine itself are diagnosed bysmall-intestine biopsy.\\nSeveral different methods are used to detect abnor-\\nmalities of the small intestine. A tissue specimen can beobtained by using an endoscope (a flexible viewingtube), or by using a thin tube with a small cutting instru-ment at the end. This latter procedure is ordered whenspecimens larger than those provided by endoscopicbiopsy are needed, because it allows removal of tissuefrom areas beyond the reach of an endoscope.\\nSeveral similar types of capsules are used for tissue\\ncollection. In each, a mercury-weighted bag is attached toone end of the capsule, while a thin polyethylene tube about5 ft (1.5 m) long is attached to the other end. Once the bag,capsule, and tube are in place in the small bowel, suction onthe tube draws the tissue into the capsule and closes it, cut-ting off the piece of tissue within. This is an invasive proce-dure, but it causes little pain and complications are rare.\\nSmall-intestine biopsy procedure\\nAfter application of a topical anesthetic to the back\\nof the patient’s throat, the capsule and the tube are intro-duced, and the patient is asked to swallow as the tube is\\nadvanced. The patient is then placed on the right side andthe instrument tip is advanced another 20 in (51 cm) orso. The tube’s position is checked by fluoroscopy or byinstilling air through the tube and listening with a stetho-scope for air to enter the stomach.\\nThe tube is advanced 2–4 in (5.1–10 cm) at a time to\\npass the capsule through the stomach outlet (pylorus).When fluoroscopy confirms that the capsule has passedthe pylorus, small samples of small intestine tissue areobtained by the instrument’s cutting edge, after whichthe instrument and tube are withdrawn. The entire proce-dure may be completed in minutes.\\nPreparation\\nThis procedure requires tissue specimens from the\\nsmall intestine through means of a tube inserted into thestomach through the mouth. The patient is to withholdfood and fluids for at least eight hours before the test.\\nAftercare\\nThe patient should not have anything to eat or drink\\nuntil the topical anesthetic wears off (usually about oneto two hours). If intravenous sedatives were administeredduring the procedure, the patient should not drive for theremainder of the day. Complications from this procedureare uncommon, but can occur. The patient is to note anyabdominal pain or bleeding and report either immediate-ly to the doctor.\\nRisks\\nComplications from this procedure are rare, but can\\ninclude bleeding (hemorrhage), bacterial infection withfever and pain, and bowel puncture (perforation). The\\npatient should immediately report any abdominal pain orbleeding to the physician in charge.

Flores\\nSmallpox\\nDefinition\\nSmallpox is an infection caused by the virus called\\nvariola, a member of the poxvirus family. Throughout allof history, smallpox has been a greatly feared disease,responsible for huge epidemics worldwide, and the causeof great suffering and massive numbers of deaths. In1980, the World Health Organization (WHO) announcedthat an extensive program of vaccination against the\\ndisease had resulted in the complete eradication of thevirus, with the exception of samples of stored virus intwo laboratories.KEY TERMS\\nSprue —A disorder of impaired absorption of nutri-\\nents from the diet by the small intestine (malab-sorption), resulting in malnutrition. Two forms ofsprue exist: tropical sprue, which occurs mainly intropical regions; and celiac sprue, which occursmore widely and is due to sensitivity to the wheatprotein gluten.\\nWhipple’s disease —A disorder of impaired\\nabsorption of nutrients by the small intestine.Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, pro-gressive weight loss, joint pain, swollen lymphnodes, abnormal skin pigmentation, anemia, andfever. The precise cause is unknown, but it is prob-ably due to an unidentified bacterial infection.Description\\nSmallpox was strictly an infection of human beings.\\nAnimals and insects could neither be infected by small-pox, nor carry the virus in any form. Most infectionswere caused by contact with a person who had alreadydeveloped the characteristic skin lesions (pox) of the dis-\\nease, although a person who had a less severe infection(not symptomatic or diagnosable in the usual way) couldunwittingly spreading the virus.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSmallpox was a relatively contagious disease, which\\naccounts for its ability to cause massive epidemics. Thevariola virus was acquired from direct contact with indi-viduals sick with the disease, from contaminated airdroplets, and even from objects used by another small-pox victim (books, blankets, utensils, etc.). The respira-tory tract was the usual entry point for the variola virusinto a human being.\\nAfter the virus entered the body, there was a 12–14\\nday incubation period during which the virus multiplied,although no symptoms were recognizable. After the incu-bation period, symptoms appeared abruptly and includedfever and chills, muscle aches, and a flat, reddish purple\\nrash on the chest, abdomen, and back. These symptomslasted about three days, after which the rash faded and thefever dropped. A day or two later, fever would return,along with a bumpy rash starting on the feet, hands, andface. The rash would progress, ultimately reaching thechest, abdomen, and back. The individual bumps(papules) would fill with clear fluid, and eventuallybecome pus-filled over the course of 10–12 days. Thesepox would eventually scab over, each leaving a perma-nently scarred pock or pit when the scab dropped off.\\nDeath from smallpox usually followed complica-\\ntions such as bacterial infection of the open skin lesions,pneumonia , or bone infections. A very severe and quick-\\nly fatal form of smallpox was called “sledgehammersmallpox,” and resulted in massive, uncontrollable bleed-ing (hemorrhage) from the skin lesions, as well as fromthe mouth, nose, and other areas of the body.\\nFear of smallpox came from both the epidemic\\nnature of the disease, as well as from the fact that notherapies were ever discovered to either treat the symp-toms of smallpox, or shorten the course of the disease.\\nDiagnosis\\nIn modern times, prior to the eradication of the vari-\\nola virus, a diagnosis of smallpox could be made usingan electron microscope to identify virus in fluid from thepapules, urine, or in the patient’s blood prior to theappearance of the papular rash.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3096SmallpoxGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3096'),\n",

No treatments were everfound that would halt the progression of the disease.\\nPrognosis\\nDeath from smallpox ranged up to about 35%, with\\nthe more severe, hemorrhagic form nearly 100% fatal.Patients who survived smallpox infection nearly alwayshad multiple areas of scarring where each pock had been.\\nPrevention\\nFrom about the tenth century in China, India, and\\nthe Americas, it was noted that individuals who had hadeven a mild case of smallpox could not be infected again.Fascinating accounts appear in writings from all over theworld of ways in which people tried to vaccinate them-selves against smallpox. Material from people ill withsmallpox (fluid or pus from the papules, scabs over thepox) was scratched into the skin of people who had neverhad the illness, in an attempt to produce a mild reactionand its accompanying protective effect. These effortsoften resulted in full-fledged smallpox, and probablyserved only to help effectively spread the infectionthroughout a community. In fact, such crude smallpoxvaccinations were against the law in Colonial America.\\nIn 1798, Edward Jenner published a paper in which\\nhe discussed his important observation that milkmaidswho contracted a mild infection of the hands (calledcowpox, and caused by a relative of the variola virus)appeared to be immune to smallpox. Jenner created animmunization against smallpox that used the pus foundin the lesions of cowpox infection. Jenner’s paper led tomuch work in the area of vaccinations, and ultimatelyresulted in the creation of a very effective vaccinationagainst smallpox which utilized the vaccinia virus,another close relative of variola.\\nIn 1967, WHO began its attempt to eradicate the\\nsmallpox virus worldwide. The methods used in the pro-gram were simple:\\n• Careful surveillance for all smallpox infections world-\\nwide, to allow for quick diagnosis and immediate quar-antine of patients.\\n• Immediate vaccination of all contacts diagnosed with\\ninfection, in order to interrupt the virus’ usual pattern ofinfection.\\nThe WHO’s program was extremely successful, and\\nthe virus was declared to have been eradicated world-wide in May of 1980. Today, two laboratories (in Atlanta,Georgia, and in Moscow, Russia) retain samples of the\\nsmallpox virus. These samples, as well as stockpiles ofthe smallpox vaccine, are stored because some level ofconcern exists that another poxvirus could undergogenetic changes (mutate) and cause human infection.Other areas of concern include the possibility of small-pox virus being utilized in biological warfare, or theremote chance that smallpox virus could somehowescape from the laboratories where it is stored. For thesereasons, surveillance continues of various animal groupsthat continue to be infected with viruses related to thevariola virus, and large quantities of vaccine are stored indifferent countries around the world, so that response toany future threat by the smallpox virus could be prompt.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nLyons, Albert S., and R.

These nasaldysfunctions range from the total loss of smell ( anosmia )\\nto dysosmia, a distorted sense of smell.\\nDescription\\nAn awareness of how the olfactory system works is\\nhelpful for understanding how smelling disorders affectKEY TERMS\\nEpidemic —A situation in which a particular infec-\\ntion is experienced by a very large percentage ofthe people in a given community within a giventime frame.\\nEradicate —To completely do away with some-\\nthing, eliminate it, end its existence.\\nHemorrhage —Bleeding that is massive, uncon-\\ntrollable, and often life-threatening.\\nLesion —The tissue disruption or the loss of func-\\ntion caused by a particular disease process.\\nPapules —Firm bumps on the skin.\\nPock—A pus-filled bump on the skin.\\nVaccine —A preparation using a non-infectious ele-\\nment or relative of a particular virus or bacteria, andadministered with the intention of halting theprogress of an infection, or completing preventing it.the sense of smell. People detect odors because sensory\\nreceptors located in the nose carry smell sensations to thebrain. The receptors, which are nerve cell endings, arefound in the mucous membrane in the roof of the nose.This section of the nose called the olfactory area is locat-ed just below the brain’s frontal lobes.\\nIn the olfactory area are millions of tiny olfactory\\ncells. Each cell contains about 12 cilia, tiny hairs thatextend into a mucus layer. The mucus moistens the cilia.Mucus also catches odor molecules, while receptors inthe cilia stimulate the molecules and send nerve impulsesto the brain.\\nOlfactory nerve fibers carry the impulse to two\\nolfactory bulbs located in the brain. Information isprocessed in the bulbs and then sent to the cerebral cor-tex. Once the transmission is inside the smell center ofthe brain, a person experiences the sense of smell.\\nA person with a normal sense of smell (normosmia) is\\nable to distinguish 10,000 odors. The sense of smell stimu-lates salivary glands. As a result, smelling disorders oftenaffect the sense of taste. The olfactory sense allows peopleto experience pleasurable odors like the scent of roses.And smell is thought to contribute to sexual attraction.\\nA smelling disorder that affects the sense of smell is\\ngenerally not life-threatening. However, it can be danger-ous. Without a sense of smell, a person might eat spoiledfood. Lack of a sense of smell could pose a health risk if aperson has little appetite and fails to eat enough. Further-more, without a sense of smell, a person might not detect agas leak or the smell of something burning. Loss of smelland the resulting loss of taste may lead to depression.\\nTypes of smelling disorders\\nSmelling disorders differ in the way that the sense of\\nsmell is affected and how long a person has the disorder.For example, anosmia, the loss of the sense of smell, isoften a temporary symptom of a cold or flu. However, ahead injury could cause permanent anosmia. In addition, a\\nhead injury could produce dysosmia, the distorted sense ofsmell that could cause a person to hallucinate a foul odor.\\nSmelling disorders are categorized as:\\n• Anosmia, the loss of the sense of smell. It is the most\\ncommon smelling disorder. This condition can be tem-porary or permanent.\\n• Dysosmia is a distorted sense of smell. A person senses\\nnon-existent unpleasant odors. It can be caused by med-ical and mental conditions.\\n• Hyperosmia is an increased sensitivity to smell. It can\\nbe a characteristic of someone with a neurotic or histri-onic personality.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3098Smelling disordersGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3098'),\n",

This is usu-\\nally a temporary condition that a person may experi-ence after a case of acute influenza . Sometimes this\\ncondition is referred to as partial anosmia.\\n• Presbyosmia refers to the lessening or loss of the olfac-\\ntory sense that occurs when a person ages.\\nSmelling disorder demographics\\nAnosmia occurs in about 10% of head trauma\\ninjuries, and head trauma is a leading cause of anosmiain young adults. In older adults, the disorder is generallycaused by viral infection. Aging may also bring a loss of\\nthe sense of smell. In rare cases, anosmia is inherited. Itis a symptom of male hypogonadism (Kallmann’s syn-\\ndrome).\\nOlfactory hallucinations known as dysosmia are\\ngenerally associated with psychological conditions. Insome cases, people may believe they are the source offoul odors.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAnosmia is the most common type of smelling dis-\\norder. Loss of the olfactory sense is generally caused bynasal congestion or obstruction. Temporary partial anos-mia often occurs when a person has a cold, the flu, orsome types of rhinitis , especially hay fever ( allergic\\nrhinitis ). During these conditions, nasal mucus mem-\\nbranes become inflamed. Other causes for anosmia are:\\n•Nasal polyps and other disorders that prevent air from\\ngetting to the area in the nose where the smell receptorsare found. Hay fever or an allergy may cause one ormore polyps to show up.\\n• Viral upper respiratory infection.• Atrophic rhinitis. This condition causes mucus mem-\\nbrane to waste away. The person may experience somelevel of permanent anosmia. One symptom of this con-dition is that a person expels a foul-smelling discharge.\\n• Hypertrophic rhinitis. Mucous membrane thickens,\\ncovering the olfactory nerve endings. If not treated,hypertrophic rhinitis can lead to permanent anosmia.This discharge could overpower other odors.\\n• Cigarettes. Smoking aggravates the nose’s membrane\\nand intensifies nasal polyp symptoms.\\n• A crooked nose or a deviated septum.• When the olfactory bulbs, tracts, or central connections\\nare destroyed. This can occur in situations such as headtrauma, infections or nasal or sinus surgery.\\n• Head injury. If both olfactory nerves are torn during a\\nhead injury, permanent anosmia results.• Medications such as antihistamines and deconges-\\ntants , especially prolonged use of decongestants.\\n• Drugs like amphetamines, estrogen, naphazoline, phe-\\nnothiazines, and resperine.\\n• The aging process may cause the sense to lessen. In\\nmost cases, there is no other obvious cause for the dis-order.\\n• A tumor behind the nose or in the membranes sur-\\nrounding the brain.\\n• Lead poisoning.• Exposure to insecticides or other chemicals.• Radiation therapy.\\n• Nervous disorders.\\n• Idiopathic loss, which means there is no diagnosable\\ncause for the condition.\\nAnosmia symptoms\\nMost people with anosmia can distinguish salty,\\nsweet, bitter, and sour tastes since the tongue senses thesetastes. However, people with anosmia cannot sense othertastes. Since taste is largely based on the olfactory sense,people complain of losing the sense of taste (ageusia).\\nDysosmia\\nInfected nasal sinuses and damage to the olfactory\\nbulbs can cause dysosmia, the distorted sense of smell.Head trauma can cause this disorder. Poor oral hygiene\\ncan lead to dysosmia. In these cases, a person may alsofind that disagreeable odors are accompanied by thesensing of unpleasant tastes. In addition, brain-stem dis-ease can cause smelling disorders.

A series of tests including ataste-and-smell test cost $250 in May of 2001.\\nTreatment\\nTreating a condition that causes a smelling disorder\\ncan sometimes restore the olfactory sense. Treatmentsfor smelling disorders are as varied as the olfactory dys-functions. Treatment for smelling disorders ranges fromlifestyle changes to surgery. Treatment of mental condi-tions could affect the smelling disorder. In some cases,the disorder can’t be treated, and the person must adjustto the loss of the sense of smell. Anosmia associated withaging is not treatable.\\nBasic treatments for anosmia\\nThe sense of smell should return after a condition\\nlike a cold or the flu ends. Decongestants such asSudafed help reduce congestion related to colds, aller-gies, and sinus conditions. Manufacturer’s dosage rec-ommendations should be followed. If anosmia is relatedto excessive use of nasal decongestants, a person shoulddiscontinue use of those medications.\\nSaline sprays can be used to clean the interior of the\\nnose.\\nIf smoking causes anosmia, a person should quit\\nsmoking.\\nThe sense of smell may return after treatment of\\nallergic or bacterial rhinitis and sinusitis.

However, cigarettesmoking also causes similar damage on a smaller scale\\nover a longer period of time. People who are trapped infires may suffer from smoke inhalation independent ofreceiving skin burns ; however, the incidence of smoke\\ninhalation increases with the percentage of total bodysurface area burned. Smoke inhalation contributes to thetotal number of fire-related deaths each year for severalreasons: the damage is serious; its diagnosis is notalways easy and there are no sensitive diagnostic tests;and patients may not show symptoms until 24–48 hoursafter the event. Children under age 11 and adults overage 70 are most vulnerable to the effects of smokeinhalation.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe harmful materials given off by combustion\\ninjure the airways and lungs in three ways: heat dam-age, tissue irritation, and oxygen starvation of tissues\\n(asphyxiation). Signs of heat damage are singed nasalhairs, burns around and inside the nose and mouth,and internal swelling of the throat. Tissue irritation ofthe throat and lungs may appear as noisy breathing,coughing, hoarseness, black or gray spittle, and fluidin the lungs. Asphyxiation is apparent from shortness\\nof breath and blue-gray or cherry-red skin color. Insome cases, the patient may not be conscious or\\nbreathing.\\nDiagnosis\\nIn addition to looking for the signs of heat damage,\\ntissue irritation, and asphyxiation, the physician willassess the patient’s breathing by the respiratory rate(number of breaths per minute) and motion of the chestas the lungs inflate and deflate. The patient’s circulationis also evaluated by the pulse rate (number of heartbeatsper minute) and blood pressure. Blood tests will indicatethe levels of oxygen and byproducts of poisonous gases.Chest x rays are too insensitive to show damage to deli-cate respiratory tissues, but can show fluid in the lungs(pulmonary edema ).\\nThe physician may perform a bronchoscopy , a visu-\\nal examination in which the airways and lungs are seenthrough a fiber optic tube inserted down the patient’swindpipe (trachea). Other pulmonary function tests maybe performed to measure how efficiently the lungs areworking.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment will vary with the severity of the damage\\ncaused by smoke inhalation. The primary focus of treat-ment is to maintain an open airway and provide an ade-quate level of oxygen. If the airway is open and stable,the patient may be given high-flow humidified 100%oxygen by mask. If swelling of the airway tissues isclosing off the airway, the patient may require the inser-tion of an endotracheal tube to artificially maintain anopen airway.\\nOxygen is often the only medication necessary.\\nHowever, patients who have a cough with wheezing\\n(bronchospasm), indicating that the bronchial airwaysare narrowed or blocked, may be given a bronchodila-tor to relax the muscles and increase ventilation. Thereare also antidotes for specific poisonous gases in theblood; dosage is dependent upon the level indicated byblood tests. Antibiotics are not given until sputum and\\nblood cultures confirm the presence of a bacterialinfection.\\nIn institutions where it is available, hyperbaric oxy-\\ngen therapy may be used to treat smoke inhalation result-ing in severe carbon monoxide or cyanide poisoning .\\nThis treatment requires a special chamber in which thepatient receives pure oxygen at three times the normalatmospheric pressure, thus receiving more oxygen fasterto overcome loss of consciousness, altered mental state,cardiovascular dysfunction, pulmonary edema , and\\nsevere neurological damage.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3102Smoke inhalationGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3102'),\n",

Casualsmoking is the act of smoking only occasionally, usuallyin a social situation or to relieve stress . A smoking habit\\nis a physical addiction to tobacco products. Many health\\nexperts now regard habitual smoking as a psychologicaladdiction, too, and one with serious health consequences.\\nDescription\\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has asserted\\nthat cigarettes and smokeless tobacco should be consid-ered nicotine delivery devices. Nicotine, the active ingre-dient in tobacco, is inhaled into the lungs, where most ofit stays. The rest passes into the bloodstream, reachingthe brain in about 10 seconds and dispersing throughoutthe body in about 20 seconds.\\nDepending on the circumstances and the amount con-\\nsumed, nicotine can act as either a stimulant or tranquiliz-er. This can explain why some people report that smokinggives them energy and stimulates their mental activity,while others note that smoking relieves anxiety and relax-\\nes them. The initial “kick” results in part from the drug’sstimulation of the adrenal glands and resulting release ofepinephrine into the blood. Epinephrine causes severalphysiological changes—it temporarily narrows the arter-ies, raises the blood pressure, raises the levels of fat in theblood, and increases the heart rate and flow of blood fromthe heart. Some researchers think epinephrine contributesto smokers’ increased risk of high blood pressure.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3103SmokingGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3103'),\n",

However, when a person smokes, he or she isingesting a lot more than nicotine. Smoke from a ciga-rette, pipe, or cigar is made up of many additional toxicchemicals, including tar and carbon monoxide. Tar is asticky substance that forms into deposits in the lungs,causing lung cancer and respiratory distress. Carbon\\nmonoxide limits the amount of oxygen that the red bloodcells can convey throughout your body. Also, it maydamage the inner walls of the arteries, which allows fatto build up in them.\\nBesides tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide, tobacco\\nsmoke contains 4,000 different chemicals. More than 200of these chemicals are known be toxic. Nonsmokers whoare exposed to tobacco smoke also take in these toxicchemicals. They inhale the smoke exhaled by the smokeras well as the more toxic sidestream smoke —the smoke\\nfrom the end of the burning cigarette, cigar, or pipe.\\nHere’s why sidestream smoke is more toxic than\\nexhaled smoke: When a person smokes, the smoke he orshe inhales and then breathes out leaves harmful depositsinside the body. But because lungs partially cleanse thesmoke, exhaled smoke contains fewer poisonous chemi-cals. That’s why exposure to tobacco smoke is dangerouseven for a nonsmoker.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nNo one starts smoking to become addicted to nico-\\ntine. It isn’t known how much nicotine may be consumedbefore the body becomes addicted. However, once smok-ing becomes a habit, the smoker faces a lifetime of healthrisks associated with one of the strongest addictionsknown to man.\\nSmoking risks\\nSmoking is recognized as the leading preventable\\ncause of death , causing or contributing to the deaths of\\napproximately 430,700 Americans each year. Anyonewith a smoking habit has an increased chance of lung,cervical, and other types of cancer; respiratory diseasessuch as emphysema ,asthma , and chronic bronchitis ;\\nand cardiovascular disease, such as heart attack , high\\nblood pressure, stroke , and atherosclerosis (narrowing\\nand hardening of the arteries). The risk of stroke is espe-cially high in women who take birth control pills.\\nSmoking can damage fertility, making it harder to\\nconceive, and it can interfere with the growth of thefetus during pregnancy . It accounts for an estimated\\n14% of premature births and 10% of infant deaths.There is some evidence that smoking may cause impo-\\ntence in some men.Because smoking affects so many of the body’s sys-\\ntems, smokers often have vitamin deficiencies and sufferoxidative damage caused by free radicals. Free radicalsare molecules that steal electrons from other molecules,turning the other molecules into free radicals and desta-bilizing the molecules in the body’s cells.\\nSmoking is recognized as one of several factors that\\nmight be related to a higher risk of hip fractures in older\\nadults.\\nStudies reveal that the more a person smokes, the\\nmore likely he is to sustain illnesses such as cancer,chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. But even smokerswho indulge in the habit only occasionally are moreprone to these diseases.\\nSome brands of cigarettes are advertised as “low\\ntar,” but no cigarette is truly safe. If a smoker switches toa low-tar cigarette, he is likely to inhale longer and moredeeply to get the chemicals his body craves. A smokerhas to quit the habit entirely in order to improve hishealth and decrease the chance of disease.\\nThough some people believe chewing tobacco is\\nsafer, it also carries health risks. People who chew tobac-co have an increased risk of heart disease and mouth andthroat cancer. Pipe and cigar smokers have increasedhealth risks as well, even though these smokers generallydo not inhale as deeply as cigarette smokers do. Thesegroups haven’t been studied as extensively as cigarettesmokers, but there is evidence that they may be at a slight-ly lower risk of cardiovascular problems but a higher riskof cancer and various types of circulatory conditions.\\nRecent research reveals that passive smokers, or\\nthose who unavoidably breathe in second-hand tobaccosmoke, have an increased chance of many health prob-lems such as lung cancer and asthma, and in children,sudden infant death syndrome .\\nSmokers’ symptoms\\nSmokers are likely to exhibit a variety of symptoms\\nthat reveal the damage caused by smoking. A naggingmorning cough may be one sign of a tobacco habit.\\nOther symptoms include shortness of breath ,wheezing ,\\nand frequent occurrences of respiratory illness, such asbronchitis.

That’s why it may be\\nwise for a smoker to turn to his physician for help. Forthe greatest success in quitting and to help with the with-drawal symptoms, the smoker should talk over a treat-ment plan with his doctor or alternative practitioner. Heshould have a general physical examination to gauge his\\ngeneral health and uncover any deficiencies. He shouldalso have a thorough evaluation for some of the seriousdiseases that smoking can cause.\\nTreatment\\nResearch shows that most smokers who want to quit\\nbenefit from the support of other people. It helps to quitwith a friend or to join a group such as those organizedby the American Cancer Society. These groups providesupport and teach behavior modification methods thatcan help the smoker quit. The smoker’s physician canoften refer him to such groups.\\nOther alternatives to help with the withdrawal symp-\\ntoms of kicking the habit include nicotine replacementtherapy in the form of gum, patches, nasal sprays, andoral inhalers. These are available by prescription or overthe counter. A physician can provide advice on how touse them. They slowly release a small amount of nicotineinto the bloodstream, satisfying the smoker’s physicalcraving. Over time, the amount of gum the smoker chewsis decreased and the amount of time between applying\\nthe patches is increased. This helps wean the smokerfrom nicotine slowly, eventually beating his addiction tothe drug. But there’s one important caution: If the smok-er lights up while taking a nicotine replacement, a nico-tine overdose may cause serious health problems.\\nThe prescription drug Zyban (buproprion hydrochlo-\\nride) has shown some success in helping smokers quit.This drug contains no nicotine, and was originally devel-oped as an antidepressant. It isn’t known exactly howbuproprion works to suppress the desire for nicotine.\\nExpected results\\nResearch on smoking shows that 80% of all smok-\\ners desire to quit. But smoking is so addictive that fewerthan 20% of the people who try ever successfully kickthe habit. Still, many people attempt to quit smokingover and over again, despite the difficulties—the crav-ings and withdrawal symptoms, such as irritability andrestlessness.\\nFor those who do quit, it’s well worth the effort. The\\ngood news is that once a smoker quits the health effectsare immediate and dramatic. After the first day, oxygenand carbon monoxide levels in the blood return to nor-mal. At two days, nerve endings begin to grow back andthe senses of taste and smell revive. Within two weeks tothree months, circulation and breathing improve. Afterone year of not smoking, the risk of heart disease isreduced by 50%. After 15 years of abstinence, the risksof health problems from smoking virtually vanish.

But the habit is also hard tobreak for physical reasons. Tobacco contains nicotine, adrug that is as addictive as cocaine or heroin. Of those\\nwho have ever tried even a single cigarette, about a thirdwill become nicotine-dependent. A person who is addict-ed to nicotine has withdrawal symptoms, such as irri-tability, anxiety , difficulty concentrating, and craving for\\ntobacco when he or she stops using tobacco.\\nSome people can stop smoking through willpower\\nalone, but most do better if they have support fromfriends, family, a physician or pharmacist, or a formalstop-smoking program. Heavy tobacco users may findthat smoking cessation products also help by easing theirwithdrawal symptoms. Most smoking cessation productscontain nicotine, but the nicotine is delivered in small,steady doses spread out over many hours. In contrast,\\nwhen a person inhales a cigarette, nicotine enters thelungs and then travels to the brain within seconds, deliv-ering the “rush” that smokers come to crave. Another dif-ference is that smoking cessation products do not containthe tar, carbon monoxide, and other toxins that make cig-arettes so harmful to people’s health. According to oneCanadian study, tobacco smoke contains over 40 differ-ent chemicals known to cause cancer .\\nThe importance of smoking cessation is reflected in\\nlegal penalties against the tobacco industry for its long-standing denial of the harm caused by tobacco products.Recent legal findings against the tobacco industry haveled to legislation in three states concerning lawsuitsagainst the industry. In Florida, state agencies can sue onbehalf of Medicaid recipients for repayment of benefits.Maryland allows the use of statistical analysis in lawsuitsagainst tobacco companies. In Vermont, the state canbring direct lawsuits against tobacco manufacturers torecover Medicaid benefits for tobacco-related illnessespaid after April 1998.

There are four forms approved bythe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as of 2001—chewing gum, skin patch, nasal spray, and inhaler. Thenasal spray and inhaler are available only with a prescrip-tion, but the gum and some brands of the patch can bebought over the counter (without a prescription). Peoplewho buy the nonprescription products should check witha physician before starting to use them. The patches aresold under the brand names Nicotrol, Nicoderm CQ, andHabitrol (prescription only). The gum is sold under thebrand name Nicorette. The nasal spray and inhaler aremarketed as Nicotrol NS and Nicotrol respectively. Thecosts of these products are about $30 for a box of 48pieces of the gum and about $30 per week for the patches.\\nOther medications\\nAnother type of smoking cessation drug, bupropion\\n(Zyban), also reduces craving and withdrawal symptoms,although it is not a nicotine replacement product. Bupro-pion is an antidepressant medication that is thought tohelp people stop smoking by mimicking some of theeffects of tobacco on brain tissue. Bupropion can be usedtogether with nicotine replacement products; severalstudies indicate that the combination helps more smokersquit than either method by itself.\\nBuspirone (BuSpar) is a tranquilizer that appears to\\nbe effective in helping smokers deal with feelings of anx-iety resulting from tobacco withdrawal.\\nAlternative approaches\\nOther approaches that have been used to help smok-\\ners quit include hypnosis and acupuncture . The evi-\\ndence for the usefulness of hypnosis is largely anecdotal;it appears to be most helpful when used in combinationwith nicotine replacement products or bupropion.Although acupuncture has been used in Western coun-tries since the 1970s to help people quit smoking, it doesnot appear to be particularly effective in this regard. ABritish study that was published in 1999 found thatsmokers who received acupuncture did not have a higherquit rate than those who received only sham acupuncture.Recommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage of nicotine replacement\\nproducts depends on the method of administration. Eachform of this medicine comes with detailed instructionsfor its use. Following directions exactly is very impor-tant. For example, nicotine gum should not be chewedlike regular chewing gum. It must be chewed very slowlyuntil it has a slight taste or causes a slight tingling sensa-tion in the mouth; then “parked” between the cheek andgum until the taste and tingling goes away; then chewedand parked in the same way for about 30 minutes. Nico-tine patches and other products also must be used cor-rectly to be effective. Some patches are meant to be wornonly during the day and removed at night; others areworn 24 hours a day.\\nSmokers who are heavily dependent on nicotine may\\nwant to ask their doctors about using a combination ofnicotine replacement products. Studies done between1995 and 2000 indicate that combining the transdermalpatch with either the gum or the nasal spray helps moresmokers quit than any of the three products by them-selves. It is thought that the higher success rate is due tothe different rates of speed at which these products deliv-er nicotine to the body. The nasal spray delivers nicotinevery rapidly, and can be used to relieve intense cravingsat times of the day when the smoker is accustomed tohaving a cigarette, while the patch delivers a smallerdosage of nicotine to the body at a steadier rate.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3109Smoking-cessation drugs\\nThe wheals on the arm of this patient was caused by an\\nallergic reaction to nicotine patches used to help subduethe urge to smoke.

It occurs when thesoft palate, uvula, tongue, tonsils, and/or muscles in theback of the throat rub against each other and generate avibrating sound during sleep. Twenty percent of alladults are chronic snorers, and 45% of normal adultssnore occasionally. As people grow older, their chance ofsnoring increases. Approximately half of all individualsover 60 snore regularly.\\nIn some cases, snoring is a symptom of a more seri-\\nous disorder called obstructed sleep apnea (OSA). OSA\\noccurs when part of the airway is closed off (usually atthe back of the throat) while a person is trying to inhaleduring sleep, and breathing stops for more than 10 sec-onds before resuming again. These breathless episodescan occur as many as several hundred times a night.\\nPeople with OSA almost always snore heavily,\\nbecause the same narrowing of the airway that causes snor-ing can also cause OSA. Snoring may actually attribute toOSA as well, because the vibration of the throat tissueswhich occurs in snoring can cause the tissue to swell.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are several major causes of snoring, including:\\n• Excessively relaxed throat muscles. Alcohol, drugs, and\\nsedatives can cause the throat muscles to become lax,and/or the tongue to pull back into the airway.\\n• Large uvula. The piece of tissue that hangs from the\\nback of the throat is called the uvula. Individuals with alarge or longer than average uvula can suffer from snor-ing when the uvula vibrates in the airway.\\n• Large tonsils and/or adenoids. The tonsils (tissue at the\\nback of either side of the throat) can also vibrate if theyare larger than normal, as can the adenoids.\\n• Excessive weight. Overweight people are more likely to\\nsnore. This is frequently caused by the extra throat andneck tissue they are carrying around.\\n• Nasal congestion. Colds and allergies can plug the\\nnose, creating a vacuum in the throat that results insnoring as airflow increases.\\n• Cysts and tumors. Cysts and/or tumors of the throat can\\ntrigger snoring.\\n• Structural problems of the nose. A deviated septum or\\nother nasal problems can also cause snoring.\\nDiagnosis\\nA patient interview, and possibly an interview with\\nthe patient’s spouse or anyone else in the household whohas witnessed the snoring, is usually enough for a diag-\\nnosis of snoring. A medical history which includes ques-tions about alcohol or tranquilizer use; past ear, nose, andthroat problems; and the pattern and degree of snoringwill be completed, and a physical exam will be per-formed to determine the cause of the problem. This willtypically include examination of the throat to look fornarrowing, obstruction, or malformations. If the snoringis suspected to be a symptom of a more serious disordersuch as obstructive sleep apnea, the patient will requirefurther testing. This testing is called a polysomnography\\nstudy, and is conducted during an overnight stay in a spe-cialized sleep laboratory. The polysomnography studyinclude measurements of heart rate, airflow at the mouthand nose, respiratory effort, sleep stage (light sleep, deepsleep, dream sleep, etc.), and oxygen level in the blood.\\nTreatment\\nSeveral surgical procedures are available for treating\\nchronic snoring. These include:\\n• Uvulopalathopharyngoplasty (UPPP), a surgical proce-\\ndure which involves removing excess throat tissues (e.g.,tonsils, parts of the soft palate) to expand the airway.\\n• Laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP) uses a surgi-\\ncal laser to remove part of the uvula and palate.\\n• Palatal stiffening is a minimally-invasive surgical tech-\\nnique where a laser or a cauterizer is used to producescar tissue in the soft palate in order to stop the vibra-tions that produce snoring.\\n• Radiofrequency ablation is another technique which\\nuses scarring to shrink the uvula and/or soft palate. Aneedle electrode is used to shrink and scar the mouthand throat tissues.\\nAlternative treatment\\nThere are a number of remedies for snoring, but few\\nare proven clinically effective. Popular treatmentsinclude:\\n• Mechanical devices. Many splints, braces, and other\\ndevices are available which reposition the nose, jaw,and/or mouth in order to clear the airways. Otherdevices are designed to wake an individual when snor-ing occurs.\\n• Nasal strips. Nasal strips that attach like an adhesive\\nbandage to the bridge of the nose are available at mostdrugstores, and can help stop snoring in some individu-als by opening the nasal passages.\\n• Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Some\\nchronic snorers find relief by sleeping with a nasalmask which provides air pressure to the throat.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3112SnoringGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3112'),\n",

These disorders are character-ized by physical complaints that appear to be medical inorigin but that cannot be explained in terms of a physicaldisease, the results of substance abuse, or by anothermental disorder. In order to meet the criteria for asomatoform disorder, the physical symptoms must beserious enough to interfere with the patient’s employ-ment or relationships, and must be symptoms that are notunder the patient’s voluntary control.\\nIt is helpful to understand that the present classifica-\\ntion of these disorders reflects recent historical changesin the practice of medicine and psychiatry. When psychi-atry first became a separate branch of medicine at the endof the nineteenth century, the term hysteria was com-\\nmonly used to describe mental disorders characterized byaltered states of consciousness (for example, sleepwalk-ing or trance states) or physical symptoms (for example,a “paralyzed” arm or leg with no neurologic cause) thatcould not be fully explained by a medical disease. Theterm dissociation was used for the psychological mecha-\\nnism that allows the mind to split off uncomfortable feel-ings, memories, or ideas so that they are lost to consciousrecall. Sigmund Freud and other pioneering psychoana-lysts thought that the hysterical patient’s symptomsresulted from dissociated thoughts or memories reemerg-ing through bodily functions or trance states. Prior to thecategorization in 1980, all mental disorders that wereconsidered to be forms of hysteria were grouped togeth-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3113Somatoform disordersGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3113'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 818}, page_content='er on the basis of this theory about their cause. Since\\n1980, however, the somatoform disorders and the so-called dissociative disorders have been placed in sepa-\\nrate categories on the basis of their chief symptoms. Ingeneral, the somatoform disorders are characterized bydisturbances in the patient’s physical sensations or abilityto move the limbs or walk, while the dissociative disor-ders are marked by disturbances in the patient’s sense ofidentity or memory.\\nDescription\\nAs a group, the somatoform disorders are difficult to\\nrecognize and treat because patients often have long his-tories of medical or surgical treatment with several dif-ferent doctors. In addition, the physical symptoms arenot under the patient’s conscious control, so that he orshe is not intentionally trying to confuse the doctor orcomplicate the process of diagnosis. Somatoform disor-ders are, however, a significant problem for the healthcare system because patients with these disturbancesoveruse medical services and resources.\\nSomatization disorder (Briquet’s syndrome)\\nSomatization disorder was formerly called Briquet’s\\nsyndrome, after the French physician who first recognizedit. The distinguishing characteristic of this disorder is agroup or pattern of symptoms in several different organsystems of the patient’s body that cannot be accounted forby medical illness. The criteria for this disorder requirefour symptoms of pain , two symptoms in the digestive\\ntract, one symptom involving the sexual organs, and onesymptom related to the nervous system. Somatization dis-order usually begins before the age of 30. It is estimatedthat 0.2% of the United States population will develop thisdisorder in the course of their lives. Another researcherestimates that 1% of all women in the United States havesymptoms of this disorder. The female-to-male ratio isestimated to range between 5:1 and 20:1.\\nSomatization disorder is considered to be a chronic\\ndisturbance that tends to persist throughout the patient’slife. It is also likely to run in families. Some psychiatriststhink that the high female-to-male ratio in this disorderreflects the cultural pressures on women in North Ameri-can society and the social “permission” given to womento be physically weak or sickly.\\nConversion disorder\\nConversion disorder is a condition in which the\\npatient’s senses or ability to walk or move are impairedwithout a recognized medical or neurological disease orcause and in which psychological factors (such as stress\\nor trauma) are judged to be temporarily related to onsetor exacerbation. The disorder gets its name from the\\nnotion that the patient is converting a psychological con-flict or problem into an inability to move specific parts ofthe body or to use the senses normally. An example of aconversion reaction would be a patient who loses his orher voice in a situation in which he or she is afraid tospeak. The symptom simultaneously contains the anxi-\\netyand serves to get the patient out of the threatening sit-\\nuation. The resolution of the emotion that underlies thephysical symptom is called the patient’s primary gain ,\\nand the change in the patient’s social, occupational, orfamily situation that results from the symptom is called asecondary gain . Doctors sometimes use these terms\\nwhen they discuss the aftereffects of conversion disorderor of other somatoform disorders on the patient’s emo-tional adjustment and lifestyle.\\nThe specific physical symptoms of conversion disor-\\nder may include a loss of balance or paralysis of an arm\\nor leg; the inability to swallow or speak; the loss of touchor pain sensation; going blind or deaf; seeing double; orhaving hallucinations , seizures, or convulsions.\\nUnlike somatization disorder, conversion disorder\\nmay begin at any age, and it does not appear to run infamilies. It is estimated that as many as 34% of the popu-lation experiences conversion symptoms over a lifetime,but that the disorder is more likely to occur among lesseducated or sophisticated people. Conversion disorder isnot usually a chronic disturbance; 90% of patients recov-er within a month, and most do not have recurrences. Thefemale-to-male ratio is between 2:1 and 5:1. Malepatients are likely to develop conversion disorders inoccupational settings or military service.\\nPain disorder\\nPain disorder is marked by the presence of severe\\npain as the focus of the patient’s concern. This categoryof somatoform disorder covers a range of patients with avariety of ailments, including chronic headaches, backproblems, arthritis, muscle aches and cramps, or pelvicpain. In some cases the patient’s pain appears to be large-ly due to psychological factors, but in other cases thepain is derived from a medical condition as well as thepatient’s psychology.\\nPain disorder is relatively common in the general\\npopulation, partly because of the frequency of work-relat-ed injuries in the United States. This disorder appears tobe more common in older adults, and the sex ratio is near-ly equal, with a female-to-male ratio of 2:1.\\nHypochondriasis\\nHypochondriasis is a somatoform disorder marked\\nby excessive fear of or preoccupation with having a seri-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3114Somatoform disordersGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3114'),\n",

It was formerly called hypochondriacal neurosis.\\nAlthough hypochondriasis is usually considered a\\ndisorder of young adults, it is now increasingly recog-nized in children and adolescents. It may also develop inelderly people without previous histories of health-relatedfears. The disorder accounts for about 5% of psychiatricpatients, and is equally common in men and women.Hypochondriasis may persist over a number of years butusually occurs as a series of episodes rather than continu-ous treatment-seeking. The flare-ups of the disorder areoften correlated with stressful events in the patient’s life.\\nBody dysmorphic disorder\\nBody dysmorphic disorder is a new category of\\nsomatoform disorders. It is defined as a preoccupationwith an imagined or exaggerated defect in appearance.Most cases involve features on the patient’s face or head,but other body parts—especially those associated withsexual attractiveness, such as the breasts or genitals—may also be the focus of concern.\\nBody dysmorphic disorder is regarded as a chronic\\ncondition that usually begins in the patient’s late teens andfluctuates over the course of time. It was initially consid-ered to be a relatively unusual disorder, but may be morecommon than was formerly thought. It appears to affectmen and women with equal frequency. Patients with bodydysmorphic disorder frequently have histories of seekingor obtaining plastic surgery or other procedures to repairor treat the supposed defect. Some may even meet the cri-teria for a delusional disorder of the somatic type.\\nSomatoform disorders in children and adolescents\\nThe most common somatoform disorders in chil-\\ndren and adolescents are conversion disorders, althoughbody dysmorphic disorders are being reported more fre-quently. Conversion reactions in this age group usuallyreflect stress in the family or problems with schoolrather than long-term psychiatric disturbances. Somepsychiatrists speculate that adolescents with conversiondisorders frequently have overprotective or overinvolvedparents with a subconscious need to see their child assick; in many cases the son or daughter’s symptomsbecome the center of family attention. The rise in bodydysmorphic disorders in adolescents is thought to reflectthe increased influence of media preoccupation withphysical perfection.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBecause the somatoform disorders are categorized\\non the basis of symptom patterns, their causes as present-ly understood include several different factors.Family stress\\nFamily stress is believed to be one of the most com-\\nmon causes of somatoform disorders in children and ado-lescents. Conversion disorders in this age group may alsobe connected with physical or sexual abuse within thefamily of origin.\\nParental modeling\\nSomatization disorder and hypochondriasis may\\nresult in part from the patient’s unconscious reflection orimitation of parental behaviors. This “copycat” behavioris particularly likely if the patient’s parent derived con-siderable secondary gain from his or her symptoms.\\nCultural influences\\nCultural influences appear to affect the gender ratios\\nand body locations of somatoform disorders, as well astheir frequency in a specific population. Some cultures(for example, Greek and Puerto Rican) report higherrates of somatization disorder among men than is thecase for the United States. In addition, researchers foundlower levels of somatization disorder among people withhigher levels of education. People in Asia and Africa aremore likely to report certain types of physical sensations(for example, burning hands or feet, or the feeling of antscrawling under the skin) than are Westerners.\\nBiological factors\\nGenetic or biological factors may also play a role.\\nFor example, people who suffer from somatization disor-der may also differ in how they perceive and process pain.\\nDiagnosis\\nAccurate diagnosis of somatoform disorders is impor-\\ntant to prevent unnecessary surgery, laboratory tests, orother treatments or procedures. Because somatoform dis-orders are associated with physical symptoms, patients areoften diagnosed by primary care physicians as well as bypsychiatrists. In many cases the diagnosis is made in ageneral medical clinic. Children and adolescents withsomatoform disorders are most likely to be diagnosed bypediatricians. Diagnosis of somatoform disorders requiresa thorough physical workup to exclude medical and neuro-logical conditions, or to assess their severity in patientswith pain disorder. A detailed examination is especiallynecessary when conversion disorder is a possible diagno-sis, because some neurological conditions—includingmultiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis—have on occa-\\nsion been misdiagnosed as conversion disorder. Somepatients who receive a diagnosis of somatoform disorderultimately go on to develop neurologic disorders.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3115Somatoform disordersGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3115'),\n",

Somatoform disorders often coexist with per-\\nsonality disorders because of the chicken-and-egg rela-\\ntionship between physical illness and certain types ofcharacter structure or personality traits. At one time, theinfluence of Freud’s theory of hysteria led doctors toassume that the patient’s hidden emotional needs “cause”the illness. But in many instances, the patient’s personali-ty may have changed over time due to the stresses ofadjusting to a chronic disease. This gradual transforma-tion is particularly likely in patients with pain disorder.Patients with somatization disorder often develop panicattacks or agoraphobia together with their physical\\nsymptoms. In addition to anxiety or personality disorders,the doctor will usually consider major depression as apossible diagnosis when evaluating a patient with symp-toms of a somatoform disorder.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy is also\\nused sometimes to treat pain disorder.\\nFamily therapy is usually recommended for chil-\\ndren or adolescents with somatoform disorders, particu-larly if the parents seem to be using the child as a focusto divert attention from other difficulties.

Relief of symptoms, including pain, can occuron the physical level, as well as on the mental, emotional,and spiritual levels.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for somatoform disorders depends, as\\na rule, on the patient’s age and whether the disorder ischronic or episodic. In general, somatization disorderand body dysmorphic disorder rarely resolve completely.Hypochondriasis and pain disorder may resolve if thereare significant improvements in the patient’s overallhealth and life circumstances, and people with both dis-orders may go through periods when symptoms becomeless severe (remissions) or become worse (exacerba-tions). Conversion disorder tends to be rapidly resolved,but may recur in about 25% of all cases.\\nPrevention\\nGeneralizations regarding prevention of somatoform\\ndisorders are difficult because these syndromes affect dif-ferent age groups, vary in their symptom patterns and per-sistence, and result from different problems of adjustmentto the surrounding culture. In theory, allowing expressionof emotional pain in children, rather than regarding it as“weak,” might reduce the secondary gain of physicalsymptoms that draw the care or attention of parents.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nClark, R.

Proper treatment depends onunderstanding the cause of the sore throat.\\nViral sore throat\\nViruses cause 90–95% of all sore throats. Cold and\\nflu viruses are the main culprits. These viruses cause aninflammation in the throat and occasionally the tonsils(tonsillitis ). Cold symptoms almost always accompany a\\nviral sore throat. These can include a runny nose, cough ,\\ncongestion, hoarseness, conjunctivitis , and fever. The\\nlevel of throat pain varies from uncomfortable to excru-\\nciating, when it is painful for the patient to eat, breathe,swallow, or speak.\\nAnother group of viruses that cause sore throat are\\nthe adenoviruses. These may also cause infections of thelungs and ears. In addition to a sore throat, symptomsthat accompany an adenovirus infection include cough,runny nose, white bumps on the tonsils and throat, milddiarrhea , vomiting, and a rash. The sore throat lasts\\nabout one week.\\nA third type of virus that can cause severe sore\\nthroat is the coxsackie virus. It can cause a disease calledherpangina. Although anyone can get herpangina, it ismost common in children up to age ten and is moreprevalent in the summer or early autumn. Herpangina issometimes called summer sore throat.\\nThree to six days after being exposed to the virus, an\\ninfected person develops a sudden sore throat that isaccompanied by a substantial fever usually between102–104°F (38.9–40°C). Tiny grayish-white blistersform on the throat and in the mouth. These fester andbecome small ulcers. Throat pain is often severe, inter-fering with swallowing. Children may become dehydrat-ed if they are reluctant to eat or drink because of the pain.In addition, people with herpangina may vomit, haveabdominal pain, and generally feel ill and miserable.\\nOne other common cause of a viral sore throat is\\nmononucleosis. Mononucleosis occurs when theEpstein-Barr virus infects one specific type of lympho-cyte. The infection spreads to the lymphatic system, res-piratory system, liver, spleen, and throat. Symptomsappear 30–50 days after exposure.\\nMononucleosis, sometimes called the kissing dis-\\nease, is extremely common. It is estimated that by theage of 35–40, 80–95% of Americans will have hadmononucleosis. Often, symptoms are mild, especially in\\nyoung children, and are diagnosed as a cold. Since symp-toms are more severe in adolescents and adults, morecases are diagnosed as monomucleosis in this age group.One of the main symptoms of mononucleosis is a severesore throat.\\nAlthough a runny nose and cough are much more\\nlikely to accompany a sore throat caused by a virus thanone caused by a bacteria, there is no absolute way to tellwhat is causing the sore throat without a laboratory test.Viral sore throats are contagious and are passed directlyfrom person to person by coughing and sneezing.\\nBacterial sore throat\\nFrom 5–10% of sore throats are caused by bacteria.\\nThe most common bacterial sore throat results from aninfection by group A Streptococcus . This type of infection\\nis commonly called strep throat . Anyone can get strep\\nthroat, but it is most common in school age children.\\nPharyngeal gonorrhea , a sexually transmitted bac-\\nterial disease, causes a severe sore throat. Gonorrhea inthe throat is transmitted by having oral sex with aninfected person.\\nNoninfectious sore throat\\nNot all sore throats are caused by infection. Post-\\nnasal drip can irritate the throat and make it sore. It canbe caused by hay fever and other allergies that irritate the\\nsinuses. Environmental and other conditions, such asheavy smoking or breathing secondhand smoke, heavy\\nalcohol consumption, breathing polluted air or chemicalfumes, or swallowing substances that burn or scratch thethroat can also cause pharyngitis. Dry air, like that in air-planes or from forced hot air furnaces, can make thethroat sore. People who breathe through their mouths atnight because of nasal congestion often get sore throatsthat improve as the day progresses. Sore throat caused byenvironmental conditions is not contagious.\\nDiagnosis\\nIt is easy for people to tell if they have a sore throat,\\nbut difficult to know what has caused it without laborato-ry tests. Most sore throats are minor and heal without anycomplications. A small number of bacterial sore throatsdo develop into serious diseases. Because of this, it isadvisable to see a doctor if a sore throat lasts more than afew days or is accompanied by fever, nausea, or abdomi-nal pain.\\nDiagnosis of a sore throat by a doctor begins with a\\nphysical examination of the throat and chest.

Since both bacterial and viral\\nsore throat are contagious and pass easily from person toperson, the doctor will seek information about whetherthe patient has been around other people with flu, sorethroat, colds, or strep throat. If it appears that the patientmay have strep throat, the doctor will do laboratory tests.\\nIf mononucleosis is suspected, the doctor may do a\\nmono spot test to look for antibodies indicating the pres-ence of the Epstein-Barr virus. The test in inexpensive,takes only a few minutes, and can be done in a physician’soffice. An inexpensive blood test can also determine thepresence of antibodies to the mononucleosis virus.\\nTreatment\\nEffective treatment varies depending on the cause of\\nthe sore throat. As frustrating as it may be to the patient,viral sore throat is best left to run its course without drugtreatment. Antibiotics have no effect on a viral sore\\nthroat. They do not shorten the length of the illness, nordo they lessen the symptoms.\\nSore throat caused by a streptococci or another bacte-\\nria must be treated with antibiotics. Penicillin is the pre-ferred medication. Oral penicillin must be taken for 10days. Patients need to take the entire amount of antibioticprescribed, even after symptoms of the sore throatimprove. Stopping the antibiotic early can lead to a returnof the sore throat. Occasionally a single injection of long-acting penicillin G is given instead of 10 days of oraltreatment. These medications generally cost under $15.\\nBecause mononucleosis is caused by a virus, there is\\nno specific drug treatment available. Rest, a healthy diet,plenty of fluids, limiting heavy exercise and competitive\\nsports, and treatment of aches with acetaminophen\\n(Datril, Tylenol, Panadol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Nuprin,Motrin, Medipren) will help the illness pass. Nearly 90%of mononucleosis infections are mild.

Because speech disorders affect a per-\\nson’s ability to communicate effectively, every aspect ofthe person’s life can be affected, for example, the per-son’s ability to make friends, and to communicate atschool or at work.\\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)\\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known\\nas Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a neurological disease thatattacks the nerve cells in the brain that control voluntarymuscles. ALS causes motor neurons to die so that thebrain and spinal cord are unable to send messages to themuscles telling them to move. Because the muscles arenot functioning, they begin to atrophy. Muscles in theface and jaw can be affected, and thereby affecting a per-son’s speech.\\nAphasia\\nAphasia results from damage to the language cen-\\nters of the brain, which affects a person’s ability to com-municate through speaking, listening, and writing.\\nPersons with aphasia have trouble with expressive\\nlanguage, what is said, or receptive language, what isunderstood. Not only are speech and understandingspeech affected, but also reading and writing is affected.The severity of aphasia varies from person to person, butin the most severe cases, a person may not be able tounderstand speech at all. Persons with mild aphasia mayonly become confused when speech becomes lengthyand complicated.\\nDevelopmental apraxia of speech\\nDevelopmental apraxia is a disorder that affects the\\nnervous system and affects a person’s ability to sequenceand say sounds, syllables, and words. The brain does notsend the correct messages to the mouth and jaw so thatthe person can say what he or she wants to say.\\nChildren who are suffering from this disorder don’t\\nbabble as an infant and first words are delayed. Olderchildren may have more difficulty with longer phrases,and may appear to be searching for words to express athought. Listeners will likely have a difficult time under-standing the child.\\nLaryngeal cancer\\nLaryngeal cancer is characterized by a malignant\\ngrowth in the larynx, or the voice box, which sometimesrequires removal of the larynx or part of it.\\nCancer anywhere in the throat affects speech, swal-\\nlowing, and chewing. Depending on the size of thegrowth, a person may have trouble moving the mouthand lips. Therefore, speech sounds and eating will be\\naffected and a person will have trouble communicating.\\nOrofacial myofunctional disorders\\nOrofacial myofunctional disorder (OMD) causes the\\ntongue to move forward in an exaggerated manner whilea person is speaking or swallowing. The tongue also mayprotrude when resting in the mouth.\\nBecause heredity contributes to the size and shape of\\na person’s mouth, there may be genetic reasons for the dis-order. Allergies also affect the mouth and face muscles,\\nwhich make it difficult to breathe because of nasal conges-tion. Because a person may sleep with the tongue protrud-ing, lip muscles weaken. Enlarged tonsils also can blockairways, creating the same breathing problems. Addition-ally, thumb-sucking, nail-biting, and teeth-clenching andgrinding also can contribute to the disorder.\\nStuttering\\nStuttering is a disorder of speech fluency that fre-\\nquently interrupts the flow of speech.\\nBecause children typically stumble and confuse\\ntheir words as speech develops, stuttering is not immedi-ately evident. It is usually when children become olderand continue to stumble that stuttering becomes evident.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)\\nInitial symptoms include weakness in any part of the\\nbody, and appendages begin to tire easily. Occasionallythe disease affects only one appendage rather than bothat the same time. Persons with ALS may have troublemaintaining balance and may stumble or have difficultywith tasks that require manual dexterity, such as button-ing a shirt or tying a shoe.\\nEventually, the diaphragm and chest wall become so\\nweak that a person cannot breathe on his or her own andneeds the help of a ventilator. Because of the lack ofmuscle strength, a person with ALS will experience diffi-culty speaking loudly and clearly until the person isunable to speak at all using the vocal cords. The personwill have difficulty pronouncing words and have difficul-ty completing lengthy sentences.\\nAlong with the difficulty in speaking also comes dif-\\nficulty in chewing and swallowing. Food can be brokendown and pureed to make it easier to chew and swallow.However, a person eventually will have difficulty chew-ing and swallowing foods that are broken down orpureed. When ability to eat is affected, proper nutrition\\nand body weight also are affected, and medical profes-sionals may decide that it is best to put in a feeding tube.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3122Speech disordersGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3122'),\n",

A speechpathologist should follow one of three plans: esophagealspeech, artificial larynx, or tracheoesophageal puncture(TEP).\\n• Esophageal speech. Without a larynx, a person is no\\nlonger able to exhale air from the lungs through themouth to speak. Using esophageal speech, the personinhales and traps the air in the throat, causing theesophagus to vibrate and create sound.\\n• Artificial larynx. A mechanical instrument can be used\\nthat produces sound for some speech. These devicescan be held against the neck or used by inserting a tubein the mouth.\\n• Tracheoesophageal puncture. This is a popular method\\nin restoring speech production. During surgery, a holeis made between the trachea and esophagus and a valveis inserted into the hole. The person breathes air into thelungs and then covers the hole in the throat. Duringexhalation, the esophagus vibrates and creates speech.\\nStuttering\\nA person suffering from stuttering may employ distrac-\\ntion strategies to help him or her stop stuttering.

In its most severeform, termed spinal rachischisis, the entire spinal canal isopen, exposing the spinal cord and nerves. More com-monly, the abnormality appears as a localized mass onthe back that is covered by skin or by the meninges, thethree-layered membrane that envelopes the spina cord.Spina bifida is usually readily apparent at birth becauseof the malformation of the back and paralysis below the\\nlevel of the abnormality.\\nVarious forms of spina bifida are known as\\nmeningomyelocele, myelomeningocele, spina bifidaaperta, open spina bifida, myelodysplasia, spinal dys-raphism, spinal rachischisis, myelocele, and meningo-cele. The term meningocele is used when the spine mal-formation contains only the protective covering(meninges) of the spinal cord. The other terms indicateinvolvement of the spinal cord and nerves in the malfor-mation. A related term, spina bifida occulta, indicatesthat one or more of the bony bodies in the spine areincompletely hardened, but that there is no abnormalityof the spinal cord itself.\\nSpina bifida occurs worldwide, but there has been a\\nsteady downward trend in occurrence rates over the past50 to 70 years, particularly in regions of high prevalence.The highest prevalence rates, about one in 200 pregnan-cies, have been reported from certain northern provincesin China. Intermediate prevalence rates, about one in1,000 pregnancies, have been found in Central and SouthAmerica. The lowest prevalence rates, less than one in2,000 pregnancies, have been found in the Europeancountries. The highest regional prevalence in the UnitedStates of about one in 500 pregnancies has occurred inthe Southeast.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSpina bifida may occur as an isolated abnormality\\nor in the company of other malformations. As an isolat-ed abnormality, spina bifida is caused by the combina-tion of genetic factors and environmental influencesthat bring about malformation of the spine and spinalcolumn.

An insufficiencyof folic acid is known to be one influential nutritional\\nfactor. Changes (mutations) in genes involving themetabolism of folic acid are believed to be significantgenetic risk factors. The recurrence risk after the birthof an infant with isolated spina bifida is 3–5%. Recur-rence may be for spina bifida or another type of spinalabnormality.\\nSpina bifida may arise because of chromosome\\nabnormalities, single gene mutations, or specific envi-ronmental insults such as maternal diabetes mellitus\\nor prenatal exposure to certain anticonvulsant drugs .\\nThe recurrence risk varies with each of these specificcauses.\\nIn most cases, spina bifida is obvious at birth\\nbecause of malformation of the spine. The spine may becompletely open, exposing the spinal cord and nerves.More commonly, the spine abnormality appears as amass on the back covered by membrane (meninges) orskin. Spina bifida may occur anywhere from the base ofthe skull to the buttocks. About 75% of abnormalitiesoccur in the lower back (lumbar) region. In rareinstances, the spinal cord malformation may occurinternally, sometimes with a connection to the gastroin-\\ntestinal tract.\\nIn spina bifida, many complications arise, dependent\\nin part on the level and severity of the spine malforma-tion. As a rule, the nerves below the level of the abnor-mality develop in a faulty manner and fail to function,resulting in paralysis and loss of sensation below the levelof the spine malformation. Since most abnormalitiesoccur in the lumbar region, the lower limbs are paralyzedand lack sensation. Furthermore, the bowel and bladderhave inadequate nerve connections, causing an inabilityto control bowel and bladder function. Most infants alsodevelop hydrocephaly, an accumulation of excess fluid inthe four cavities of the brain. At least one of every sevencases develop findings of Chiari II malformation, a condi-tion in which the lower part of the brain is crowded andmay be forced into the upper part of the spinal cavity.\\nThere are a number of mild variant forms of spina\\nbifida, including multiple vertebral abnormalities, skindimples, tufts of hair, and localized areas of skin defi-ciency over the spine. Two variants, lipomeningocele andlipomyelomeningocele, typically occur in the lower backarea (lumbar or sacral) of the spine.

The diagnosis is usually obvious based on the externalfindings at birth. Paralysis below the level of the abnor-mality and fluid on the brain (hydrocephaly) may con-tribute to the diagnosis. Other spine abnormalities such ascongenital scoliosis and kyphosis , or soft tissue tumors\\noverlying the spine, are not likely to have these accompa-nying findings. In cases in which there are no externalfindings, the diagnosis is more difficult and may notbecome evident until neurological abnormalities or hydro-cephaly develop weeks, months, or years following birth.\\nPrenatal diagnosis may be made in most cases with\\nultrasound examination after 12–14 weeks of pregnancy .\\nMany cases are also detected by the testing of the moth-er’s blood for the level of alpha-fetoprotein at about 16weeks of pregnancy. If the spine malformation is not skincovered, alpha-fetoprotein from the fetus’ circulation mayleak into the surrounding amniotic fluid, a small portionof which is absorbed into the mother’s blood.\\nTreatment\\nAggressive surgical and medical management have\\nimproved the survival and function of infants with spinabifida. Initial surgery may be carried out during the firstdays of life, providing protection against injury andinfection. Subsequent surgery is often necessary to pro-tect against excessive curvature of the spine, and in thepresence of hydrocephaly, to place a mechanical shunt todecrease the pressure and amount of cerebrospinal fluidin the cavities of the brain. Because of weakness orparalysis below the level of the spine abnormality, mostchildren will require physical therapy, bracing, and otherorthopedic assistance to enable them to walk. A varietyof approaches including periodic bladder catheterization,surgical diversion of urine, and antibiotics are used to\\nprotect urinary function.\\nAlthough most individuals with spina bifida have\\nnormal intellectual function, learning disabilities ormental retardation occur in a minority. This may result,\\nin part, from hydrocephaly and/or infections of the ner-vous system. Children so affected may benefit from earlyeducational intervention, physical therapy, and occupa-tional therapy.

The major prevention is through the use of a Bvitamin, folic acid, for several months prior to and fol-lowing conception. The Centers for Disease Control andPrevention recommend the intake of 400 micrograms ofsynthetic folic acid every day for all women of childbear-ing years.\\nPrognosis\\nMore than 80% of infants born with spina bifida sur-\\nvive with surgical and medical management.

Stevenson\\nSpina bifida occulta seeSpina bifida\\nSpinal cord injury\\nDefinition\\nSpinal cord injury is damage to the spinal cord that\\ncauses loss of sensation and motor control.\\nDescription\\nApproximately 10,000 new spinal cord injuries\\n(SCIs) occur each year in the United States. About250,000 people are currently affected. Spinal cordinjuries can happen to anyone at any time of life. Thetypical patient, however, is a man between the ages of19 and 26, injured in a motor vehicle accident (about50% of all SCIs), a fall (20%), an act of violence (15%),or a sporting accident (14%). Alcohol or other drugabuse plays an important role in a large percentage of allspinal cord injuries. Six percent of people who receiveinjuries to the lower spine die within a year, and 40% ofpeople who receive the more frequent higher injuries diewithin a year.\\nShort-term costs for hospitalization, equipment, and\\nhome modifications are approximately $140,000 for anSCI patient capable of independent living. Lifetime costsmay exceed one million dollars. Costs may be three tofour times higher for the SCI patient who needs long-term institutional care. Overall costs to the Americaneconomy in direct payments and lost productivity aremore than $10 billion per year.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe spinal cord is about as big around as the index\\nfinger. It descends from the brain down the back throughhollow channels of the backbone. The spinal cord ismade of nerve cells (neurons). The nerve cells carry sen-sory data from the areas outside the spinal cord (periph-ery) to the brain, and they carry motor commands frombrain to periphery. Peripheral neurons are bundledtogether to make up the 31 pairs of peripheral nerveroots. The peripheral nerve roots enter and exit the spinalcord by passing through the spaces between the stackedvertebrae. Each pair of nerves is named for the vertebrafrom which it exits. These are known as:\\n• C1-8. These nerves enter from the eight cervical or\\nneck vertebrae.\\n• T1-12. These nerves enter from the thoracic or chest\\nvertebrae.\\n• L1-5. These nerves enter from the lumbar vertebrae of\\nthe lower back.\\n• S1-5. These nerves enter through the sacral or pelvic\\nvertebrae.\\n• Coccygeal. These nerves enter through the coccyx or\\ntailbone.\\nPeripheral nerves carry motor commands to the\\nmuscles and internal organs, and they carry sensationsfrom these areas and from the body’s surface. (Sensorydata from the head, including sight, sound, smell, andtaste, do not pass through the spinal cord and are notaffected by most SCIs.) Damage to the spinal cord inter-rupts these signals. The interruption damages motorfunctions that allow the muscles to move, sensory func-tions such as feeling heat and cold, and autonomic func-tions such as urination, sexual function, sweating, andblood pressure.\\nSpinal cord injuries most often occur where the\\nspine is most flexible, in the regions of C5-C7 of theneck, and T10-L2 at the base of the rib cage. Severalphysically distinct types of damage are recognized.Sudden and violent jolts to nearby tissues can jar thecord. This jarring causes a temporary spinal concus-sion. Concussion symptoms usually disappear com-pletely within several hours. A spinal contusion orbruise is bleeding within the spinal column. The pres-sure from the excess fluid may kill spinal cord neurons.Spinal compression is caused by some object, such as atumor, pressing on the cord. Lacerations or tears causedirect damage to cord neurons. Lacerations can becaused by bone fragments or missiles such as bullets.Spinal transection describes the complete severing ofthe cord. Most spinal cord injuries involve two or moreof these types of damage.\\nSymptoms\\nPARALYSIS AND LOSS OF SENSATION. The extent to\\nwhich movement and sensation are damaged depends onthe level of the spinal cord injury. Nerves leaving the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3128Spinal cord injuryGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3128'),\n",

The distributionis roughly as follows:\\n• C1-C4: head and neck.\\n• C3-C5: diaphragm (chest and breathing).\\n• C5-T1: shoulders, arms and hands.\\n• T2-T12: chest and abdomen (excluding internal organs).• L1-L4: abdomen (excluding internal organs), buttocks,\\ngenitals, and upper legs.\\n• L4-S1: legs.\\n• S2-S4: genitals and muscles of the perineum.\\nDamage below T1, which lies at the base of the rib\\ncage, causes paralysis and loss of sensation in the legs\\nand trunk below the injury. Injury at this level usuallydoes no damage to the arms and hands. Paralysis of thelegs is called paraplegia. Damage above T1 involves thearms as well as the legs. Paralysis of all four limbs iscalled quadriplegia or tetraplegia. Cervical or neckinjuries not only cause quadriplegia but also may causedifficulty in breathing. Damage in the lower part of theneck may leave enough diaphragm control to allow unas-sisted breathing. Patients with damage at C3 or above,just below the base of the skull, require mechanical assis-tance to breathe.\\nSymptoms also depend on the extent of spinal cord\\ninjury. A completely severed cord causes paralysis andloss of sensation below the wound. If the cord is onlypartially severed, some function will remain below theinjury. Damage limited to the front portion of the cordcauses paralysis and loss of sensations of pain and tem-\\nperature. Other sensation may be preserved. Damage tothe center of the cord may spare the legs but paralyze thearms. Damage to the right or left half causes loss of posi-tion sense, paralysis on the side of the injury, and loss ofpain and temperature sensation on the opposite side.\\nDEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS. Blood does not flow\\nnormally to a paralyzed limb that is inactive for longperiods. The blood pools in the deep veins and formsclots, a condition known as deep vein thrombosis . A\\nclot or thrombus can break free and lodge in smallerarteries in the brain, causing a stroke , or in the lungs,\\ncausing pulmonary embolism .\\nPRESSURE ULCERS. Inability to move also leads to\\npressure ulcers or bed sores. Pressure ulcers form whereskin remains in contact with a bed or chair for a longtime. The most common sites of pressure ulcers are thebuttocks, hips, and heels.\\nSPASTICITY AND CONTRACTURE. A paralyzed limb\\nis incapable of active movement, but the muscle still hastone, a constant low level of contraction. Normal muscle\\ntone requires communication between the muscle andthe brain. Spinal cord injury prevents the brain fromtelling the muscle to relax. The result is prolonged mus-cle contraction or spasticity. Because the muscles thatextend and those that bend a joint are not usually equalin strength, the involved joint is bent, often severely.This constant pressure causes deformity. As the muscleremains in the shortened position over several weeks ormonths, the tendons remodel and cause permanent mus-cle shortening or contracture. When muscles have per-manently shortened, the inner surfaces of joints, such asarmpits or palms, cannot be cleaned and the skin breaksdown in that area.\\nHETEROTOPIC OSSIFICATION. Heterotopic ossifica-\\ntion is an abnormal deposit of bone in muscles and ten-dons that may occur after injury. It is most common inthe hips and knees. Initially heterotopic ossification caus-es localized swelling, warmth, redness, and stiffness ofthe muscle. It usually begins one to four months after theinjury and is rare after one year.\\nAUTONOMIC DYSREFLEXIA. Body organs that regu-\\nlate themselves, such as the heart, gastrointestinal tract,and glands, are controlled by groups of nerves calledautonomic nerves. Autonomic nerves emerge fromthree different places: above the spinal column, in thelower back from vertebrae T1-L4, and from the lowestregions of the sacrum at the base of the spine. In gener-al, these three groups of autonomic nerves operate inbalance. Spinal cord injury can disrupt this balance, acondition called autonomic dysreflexia or autonomichyperreflexia. Patients with injuries at T6 or above areat greatest risk.\\nIn autonomic dysreflexia, irritation of the skin,\\nbowel, or bladder causes a highly exaggerated responsefrom autonomic nerves. This response is caused by theuncontrolled release of norepinephrine, a hormone simi-lar to adrenaline. Uncontrolled release of norepinephrinecauses a rapid rise in blood pressure and a slowing of theheart rate. These symptoms are accompanied by throb-bing headache , nausea, anxiety , sweating, and goose\\nbumps below the level of the injury. The elevated bloodpressure can rapidly cause loss of consciousness,seizures, cerebral hemorrhage, and death . Autonomic\\ndysreflexia is most often caused by an over-full bladder orbladder infection, impaction or hard impassable fecalmass in the bowel, or skin irritation from tight clothing,sunburn , or other irritant. Inability to sense these irritants\\nbefore the autonomic reaction begins is a major cause ofdysreflexia.\\nLOSS OF BLADDER AND BOWEL CONTROL. Bladder\\nand bowel control require both motor nerves and the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3129Spinal cord injuryGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3129'),\n",

When the autonomic nervous sys-tem triggers an urge to urinate or defecate, continence ismaintained by contracting the anal or urethral sphinc-ters. A sphincter is a ring of muscle that contracts toclose off a passage or opening in the body. When theneural connections to these muscles are severed, con-scious control is lost. In addition, loss of feeling mayprevent sensations of fullness from reaching the brain.To compensate, the patient may help empty the bowel orbladder by using physical maneuvers that stimulateautonomic contractions before they would otherwisebegin. However, the patient may not be able to relax thesphincters. If the sphincters cannot be relaxed, thepatient will retain urine or feces.\\nRetention of urine may cause muscular changes in\\nthe bladder and urethral sphincter that make the problemworse. Urinary tract infection is common. Retention offeces can cause impaction. Symptoms of impactioninclude loss of appetite and nausea. Untreated impaction\\nmay cause perforation of the large intestine and rapidoverwhelming infection.\\nSEXUAL DYSFUNCTION. Men who have sustained\\nSCI may be unable to achieve an erection or ejaculate.Sperm formation may be abnormal too, reducing fertili-ty. Fertility and the ability to achieve orgasm are lessimpaired for women. Women may still be able tobecome pregnant and deliver vaginally with propermedical care.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe location and extent of spinal cord injury is deter-\\nmined with computed tomography scans (CT scans),\\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and x rays. X\\nrays may be enhanced with an injected contrast dye.\\nTreatment\\nA person who may have a spinal cord injury should\\nnot be moved. Treatment of SCI begins with immobi-\\nlization . This strategy prevents partial injuries of the\\ncord from severing it completely. Use of splints to com-pletely immobilize suspected SCI at the scene of theinjury has helped reduce the severity of spinal cordinjuries in the last two decades. Intravenous methylpred-nisone, a steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is given dur-ing the first 24 hours to reduce inflammation and tissuedestruction.\\nRehabilitation after spinal cord injury seeks to\\nprevent complications, promote recovery, and make themost of remaining function. Rehabilitation is a com-plex and long-term process. It requires a team of pro-fessionals, including a neurologist, physiatrist or reha-bilitation specialist, physical therapist, and occupation-al therapist. Other specialists who may be neededinclude a respiratory therapist, vocational rehabilita-tion counselor, social worker, speech-language pathol-ogist, nutritionist, special education teacher, recreationtherapist, and clinical psychologist. Support groupsprovide a critical source of information, advice, andsupport for SCI patients.\\nParalysis and loss of sensation\\nSome limited mobility and sensation may be recov-\\nered, but the extent and speed of this recovery cannot bepredicted. Experimental electrical stimulation has beenshown to allow some control of muscle contraction inparaplegia. This experimental technique offers the possi-bility of unaided walking. Further development of cur-rent control systems will be needed before useful move-ment is possible outside the laboratory.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3130Spinal cord injuryCervical region\\n(C1-C5)\\nThoracic region\\n(T1-T12)\\nLumbar region\\n(L1-L4)\\nSacral region\\n(S1-S4)\\nThe extent of sensory and motor loss resulting from a\\nspinal cord injury depends on the level of the injurybecause nerves at different levels control sensation andmovement in different parts of the body.The distribution isas follows: C1-C4: head and neck; C3-C5: diaphragm; C5-T1:shoulders, arms, and hands;T2-T12: chest and abdomen(excluding internal organs); L1-L4: abdomen (excludinginternal organs), buttocks, genitals, upper legs; L4-S3: legs;S2-S4: genitals, muscles of the perineum.

A tumor in this loca-tion can compress the spinal cord or its nerve roots;therefore, even a noncancerous growth can be disablingunless properly treated.\\nDescription\\nThe spinal cord contains bundles of nerves that carry\\nmessages betweent the brain and the body. Because thespinal cord is rigidly encased in bone, any tumor thatgrows on or near it can compress the nerves, and inter-fere in this communication. About 10,000 Americansdevelop spinal cord tumors each year, and about 40% ofthese are cancerous. Similar to brain tumors, spinal cordgrowths are rare.\\nNewly formed tumors that begin within the spinal\\ncord are unusual, especially among children and theelderly. More typically, tumors originate elsewhere in thebody and move through the bloodstream (metastasize) tothe spinal cord.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nScientists don’t know what causes these tumors,\\nalthough the noncancerous growths may be hereditary orpresent since birth.\\nWhen the tumor presses on the spinal cord, it causes\\nsymptoms including;\\n• back pain\\n• severe or burning pain in other parts of the body• numbness or cold• progressive loss of muscle strength or sensation in the\\nlegs\\n• loss of bladder or bowel control\\nA tumor in the top of the spinal column can cause\\npain radiating from the arms or neck; a tumor in thelower spine may cause leg or back pain. If there are sev-eral tumors in different areas of the spinal cord at thesame time, it may cause symptoms in a variety of spotson the body.\\nDiagnosis\\nSuspected spinal cord compression, by tumor, is a\\nmedical emergency.

Surgery\\nis usually the first step in treating benign and malignanttumors outside the spinal cord. Tumors inside the spinalcord may not be able to be completely removed withsurgery. If they can not be, radiation and chemotherapy\\ntreatments may be effective. Treatment also may includepain relievers and cortisone drugs to lessen swellingaround the tumor, and ease pressure on the spinal cord.\\nPrognosis\\nEarly diagnosis and treatment can produce a higher\\nsuccess rate. Long-term survival also depends on thetumor’s type, location, and size. Surgery to remove thebone around the cord can ease pressure on the spinalnerves and nerve pathways, which will usually ease painand other symptoms; however, it may make walking moredifficult. Physical therapy and rehabilitation may help.KEY TERMS\\nComputed tomography scans (CT scan) —The CT\\nscan combines an x ray with a computer to createa detailed picture of the spinal cord.

Scoliosisis a disorder of unknown origin. It causes bending andtwisting of the spine that eventually results in distortionof the chest and back. About 85% of cases occur in girlsbetween the ages of 12 and 15, who are experiencingadolescent growth spurt.\\nSpinal instrumentation serves three purposes. It pro-\\nvides a stable, rigid column that encourages bones tofuse after spinal-fusion surgery. Second, it redirects thestresses over a wider area. Third, it restores the spine toits proper alignment.\\nDifferent types of spinal instrumentation are used to\\ntreat different spinal problems. Several common types ofspinal instrumentation are explained below. Although thedetails of the insertion of rods, wires, and hooks varies,the purpose of all spinal instrumentation is the same—tocorrect and stabilize the backbone.\\nHarrington rod\\nThe Harrington Rod is one of the oldest and most\\nproven forms of spinal instrumentation. It is used tostraighten and stabilize the spine when curvature isgreater than 60 degrees. It is an appropriate treatment forscoliosis.\\nAdvantages of the Harrington rod are its relative\\nsimplicity of installation, the low rate of complications,and a proven record of reducing curvature of the spine.The main disadvantage is that the patient must remainin a body cast for about six months, then wear a bracefor another three to six months while the bone fusionsolidifies.\\nLuque rod\\nLuque rods are custom contoured metal rods that are\\nfixed to each segment (vertebra) in the affected part ofthe spine. The main advantage is that the patient may notneed to wear a cast or brace after the procedure. Themain disadvantage is that the risk of injury to the nervesand spinal cord is higher than with a some other forms ofinstrumentation. This is because wires must be threadedthrough each vertebra near the spinal column, increasingthe risk of such damage. Luque rods are sometimes usedto treat scoliosis.\\nDrummond instrumentation\\nDrummond instrumentation, also called Harri-\\nDrummond instrumentation, uses a Harrington rod onthe concave side of the spine and a Luque rod on the con-vex side. The advantage is that each vertebra segment isfixed, with the risk of nerve injury decreased over Luquerod instrumentation. The disadvantage is that, like Har-\\nrington rod instrumentation, the patient must wear a castand a brace after surgery.\\nCotrel-Dubousset instrumentation\\nCotrel-Dubousset instrumentation uses hooks and\\nrods in a cross-linked pattern to realign the spine andredistribute the biomechanical stress. The main advan-tage of Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation is that, becauseof the extensive cross-linking, the patient may have towear a cast or brace after surgery. The disadvantage isthe complexity of the operation and the number of hooksand cross-links that may fail.\\nZeilke instrumentation\\nZeilke instrumentation is similar to Cotrel-Dubous-\\nset instrumentation, but is used to treat double curvatureof the spine. It requires wearing a brace for many monthsafter surgery.\\nOther forms of instrumentation\\nThe Kaneda device is used to treat fractured thoracic\\nor lumbar vertebrae when it is suspected that bone frag-ments are present in the spinal canal. Variations on thebasic forms of spinal instrumentation, such as Wisconsininstrumentation, are being refined as technology improves.A physician chooses the proper type of instrumentationbased on the type of disorder, the age and health of thepatient, and on the physician’s experience.\\nPrecautions\\nSince the hooks and rods of spinal instrumentation\\nare anchored in the bones of the back, spinal instrumen-tation should not be performed on people with seriousosteoporosis . To overcome this limitation, techniques\\nare being explored that help anchor instrumentation infragile bones.\\nDescription\\nSpinal instrumentation is performed by a neuro\\nand/or orthopedic surgical team with special experiencein spinal operations. The surgery is done in a hospitalunder general anesthesia. It is done at the same time asspinal fusion.\\nThe surgeon strips the muscles away from the area\\nto be fused. The surface of the bone is peeled away. Apiece of bone is removed from the hip and placed alongside the area to be fused. The stripping of the bone helpsthe bone graft to fuse.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3134Spinal instrumentationGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3134'),\n",

The patient will undergo many tests to deter-mine that nature and exact location of the back problem.These tests are likely to include x rays, magnetic reso-\\nnance imaging (MRI), computed tomography scans\\n(CT scans), and myleograms. In addition, the patientwill undergo a battery of blood and urine tests, and pos-sibly an electrocardiogram to provide the surgeon andanesthesiologist with information that will allow theoperation to be performed safely. In Harrington rodinstrumentation, the patient may be placed in traction\\nor an upper body cast to stretch contracted musclesbefore surgery.\\nAftercare\\nAfter surgery, the patient will be confined to bed. A\\ncatheter is inserted so that the patient can urinate withoutgetting up. Vital signs are monitored, and the patient’sposition is changed frequently so that bedsores do not\\ndevelop.\\nRecovery from spinal instrumentation can be a long,\\narduous process. Movement is severely limited for aperiod of time. In certain types of instrumentation, thepatient is put in a cast to allow the realigned bones to stayin position until healing takes place. This can be as longas six to eight months. Many patients will need to wear abrace after the cast is removed.\\nDuring the recovery period, the patient is taught res-\\npiratory exercises to help maintain respiratory functionduring the time of limited mobility. Physical therapistsassist the patient in learning self-care and in performingstrengthening and range of motion exercises. Length ofhospital stay depends on the age and health of thepatient, as well as the specific problem that was correct-ed. The patient can expect to remain under a physician’scare for many months.\\nRisks\\nSpinal instrumentation carries a significant risk of\\nnerve damage and paralysis .

Spinalstenosis causes pain and may cause loss of some body\\nfunctions.\\nDescription\\nSpinal stenosis is a progressive narrowing of the\\nopening in the spinal canal. The spine is a long series ofbones called vertebrae. Between each pair of vertebra is afibrous intervertebral disk. Collectively, the vertebraeand disks are called the backbone. Each vertebra has ahole through it. These holes line up to form the spinalcanal. A large bundle of nerves called the spinal cordruns through the spinal canal. This bundle of 31 nervescarries messages between the brain and the various partsof the body. At each vertebra, some smaller nervesbranch out from these nerve roots to serve the musclesand tissue in the immediate area. When the spinal canalnarrows, nerve roots in the spinal cord are squeezed.Pressure on the nerve roots causes chronic pain and lossof control over some functions because communicationwith the brain is interrupted. The lower back and legs aremost affected by spinal stenosis. The nerve roots thatsupply the legs are near the bottom of the spinal cord.The pain gets worse after standing for a long time andafter some forms of exercise . The posture required by\\nthese physical activities increases the stress on the nerve\\nroots. Spinal stenosis usually affects people over 50years of age. Women have the condition more frequentlythan men do.\\nCervical spinal stenosis is a narrowing of the verte-\\nbrae of the neck (cervical vertebrae). The disease and itseffects are similar to stenosis in the lower spine. A nar-rower opening in the cervical vertebrae can also put pres-sure on arteries entering the spinal column, cutting offthe blood supply to the remainder of the spinal cord.Causes and symptoms\\nSpinal stenosis causes pain in the buttocks, thigh, and\\ncalf and increasing weakness in the legs. The patient mayalso have difficulty controlling bladder and bowel func-tions. The pain of spinal stenosis seems more severe whenthe patient walks downhill. Spinal stenosis can be congeni-tal, acquired, or a combination. Congenital spinal stenosisis a birth defect. Acquired spinal stenosis develops afterbirth. It is usually a consequence of tissue destruction(degeneration) caused by an infectious disease or a diseasein which the immune system attacks the body’s own cells(autoimmune disease). The two most common causes ofspinal stenosis are birth defect and progressive degenera-tion of the tissue of the joints ( osteoarthritis ). Other causes\\ninclude improper alignment of the vertebrae as in spondy-lolisthesis, destruction of bone tissue as in Paget’s disease,or an overgrowth of bone tissue as in diffuse idiopathicskeletal hyperostosis. The spinal canal is usually more than0.5 in (12 mm) in diameter. A smaller diameter indicatesstenosis. The diameter of the cervical spine ranges is 0.6–1in (5–12 mm). Any opening under 0.5 in (13 mm) in diam-eter is considered evidence of stenosis. Acquired spinalstenosis usually begins with degeneration of the interverte-bral disks or the surfaces of the vertebrae or both. In tryingto heal this degeneration, the body builds up the spinal col-umn. In the process, the spinal canal can become narrower.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe physician must determine that the symptoms are\\ncaused by spinal stenosis. Conditions that can cause sim-ilar symptoms include a slipped (herniated) interverte-bral disk, spinal tumors, and disorders of the blood flow(circulatory disorders). Spinal stenosis causes back andleg pain. The leg pain is usually worse when the patientis standing or walking. Some forms of spinal stenosis areless painful when the patient is riding an exercise bikebecause the forward tilt of the body changes the pressurein the spinal column. Doppler scanning can trace theflow of blood to determine whether the pain is caused bycirculatory problems. X-ray images, computed tomog-\\nraphy scans (CT scans), and magnetic resonance imag-\\ning(MRI) scans can reveal any narrowing of the spinal\\ncanal. Electromyography , nerve conduction velocity, or\\nevoked potential studies can locate problems in the\\nmuscles indicating areas of spinal cord compression.\\nTreatment\\nMild cases of spinal stenosis may be treated with\\nrest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as\\naspirin ), and muscle relaxants . Spinal stenosis can be a\\nprogressive disease, however, and the source of pressuremay have to be surgically removed (surgical decompres-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3136Spinal stenosisGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3136'),\n",

The surgical procedure removes boneand other tissues that have entered the spinal canal or putpressure on the spinal cord. Two vertebrae may be fused,to eliminate improper alignment, such as that caused byspondylolisthesis. For surgery, patients lie on their sidesor in a modified kneeling position. This position reducesbleeding and places the spine in proper alignment. Align-ment is especially important if vertebrae are to be fused.Surgical decompression can eliminate leg pain andrestore control of the legs, bladder, and bowels, but usu-ally does not eliminate lower back pain. Physical therapyand massage can help reduce the symptoms of spinalstenosis. An exercise program should be developed toincrease flexibility and mobility. A brace or corset maybe worn to improve posture. Activities that place stresson the lower back muscles should be avoided.KEY TERMS\\nComputed tomography (CT) scans —An imaging\\ntechnique in which cross-sectional x rays of thebody are compiled to create a three-dimensionalimage of the body’s internal structures.\\nCongenital —Present before birth.

In adults, the spleen is about 4.8 /H11003\\n2.8 /H110031.6 in (12 /H110037 /H110034 cm) in size, and weighs about\\n4–5 oz (113–142 g). Its functions include a role in theimmune system; filtering foreign substances from theblood; removing worn-out blood cells from the blood;regulating blood flow to the liver; and sometimes storingblood cells. The storage of blood cells is called seques-tration. In healthy adults, about 30% of blood plateletsare sequestered in the spleen.\\nPurpose\\nSplenectomies are performed for a variety of different\\nreasons and with different degrees of urgency. Mostsplenectomies are done after the patient has been diag-nosed with hypersplenism .

It is char-\\nacterized by enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly),defects in the blood cells, and an abnormally high turnoverof blood cells. It is almost always associated withsplenomegaly caused by specific disorders such as cirrho-\\nsisof the liver or certain cancers. The decision to perform\\na splenectomy depends on the severity and prognosis ofthe disease that is causing the hypersplenism.\\nSplenectomy always necessary\\nThere are two diseases for which splenectomy is the\\nonly treatment—primary cancers of the spleen and a blooddisorder called hereditary spherocytosis (HS). In HS, theabsence of a specific protein in the red blood cell mem-brane leads to the formation of relatively fragile cells thatare easily damaged when they pass through the spleen. Thecell destruction does not occur elsewhere in the body andends when the spleen is removed. HS can appear at anyage, even in newborns, although doctors prefer to put offremoving the spleen until the child is five or six years old.\\nSplenectomy usually necessary\\nThere are some disorders in which splenectomy is\\nusually recommended. They include:• Immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).\\nITP is a disease involving platelet destruction. Splenec-tomy is the definitive treatment for this disease and iseffective in about 70% of chronic ITP cases.\\n• Trauma. The spleen can be ruptured by blunt as well as\\npenetrating injuries to the chest or abdomen. Car acci-dents are the most common cause of blunt traumaticinjury to the spleen.\\n• Abscesses in the spleen. These are relatively uncom-\\nmon but have a high mortality rate.\\n• Rupture of the splenic artery. Rupture sometimes\\noccurs as a complication of pregnancy.\\n• Hereditary elliptocytosis. This is a relatively rare disor-\\nder. It is similar to HS in that it is characterized by redblood cells with defective membranes that aredestroyed by the spleen.\\nSplenectomy sometimes necessary\\nIn other disorders, the spleen may or may not be\\nremoved.\\n• Hodgkin’s disease, a serious form of cancer that causes\\nlymph nodes to enlarge.

TTP is a\\nrare disorder marked by fever , kidney failure, and an\\nabnormal decrease in the number of platelets. Splenec-tomy is one part of treatment for TTP.\\n• Autoimmune hemolytic disorders. These disorders may\\nappear in patients of any age but are most common inpatients over 50. The red blood cells are destroyed byantibodies produced by the patient’s own body (autoan-tibodies).\\n•Myelofibrosis . Myelofibrosis is a disorder in which\\nbone marrow is replaced by fibrous tissue. It producessevere and painful splenomegaly. Splenectomy does notcure myelofibrosis but may be performed to relievepain caused by the swollen spleen.\\n•Thalassemia . Thalassemia is a hereditary form of ane-\\nmia that is most common in people of Mediterraneanorigin. Splenectomy is sometimes performed if thepatient’s spleen has become painfully enlarged.\\nPrecautions\\nPatients should be carefully assessed regarding the\\nneed for a splenectomy. Because of the spleen’s role inprotecting people against infection, it should not beremoved unless necessary. The operation is relativelysafe for young and middle-aged adults. Older adults,especially those with cardiac or pulmonary disease, aremore vulnerable to post-surgical infections. Thromboem-bolism following splenectomy is another complicationfor this patient group, which has about 10% mortalityfollowing the surgery. Splenectomies are performed inchildren only when the benefits outweigh the risks.\\nThe most important part of the assessment is the mea-\\nsurement of splenomegaly. The normal spleen cannot befelt when the doctor examines the patient’s abdomen. Aspleen that is large enough to be felt indicatessplenomegaly. In some cases the doctor will hear a dullsound when he or she thumps (percusses) the patient’sabdomen near the ribs on the left side. Imaging studies thatcan be used to demonstrate splenomegaly include ultra-sound tests, technetium-99m sulfur colloid imaging, andCT scans. The rate of platelet or red blood cell destructionby the spleen can be measured by tagging blood cells withradioactive chromium or platelets with radioactive indium.\\nDescription\\nComplete splenectomy\\nREMOVAL OF ENLARGED SPLEEN. Splenectomy is per-\\nformed under general anesthesia. The most common tech-nique is used to remove greatly enlarged spleens. After the\\nsurgeon makes a cut (incision) in the abdomen, the arteryto the spleen is tied to prevent blood loss and reduce thespleen’s size. It also helps prevent further sequestration ofblood cells. The surgeon detaches the ligaments holding thespleen in place and removes it. In many cases, tissue sam-ples will be sent to a laboratory for analysis.\\nREMOVAL OF RUPTURED SPLEEN. When the spleen\\nhas been ruptured by trauma, the surgeon approaches theorgan from its underside and fastens the splenic artery.\\nPartial splenectomy\\nIn some cases the surgeon removes only part of the\\nspleen. This procedure is considered by some to be a use-ful compromise that reduces pain from an enlargedspleen while leaving the patient less vulnerable to infec-tion. Long-term follow-up of the results of partialsplenectomies has not yet been done.\\nLaparoscopic splenectomy\\nLaparoscopic splenectomy, or removal of the spleen\\nthrough several small incisions, has been more frequent-ly used in recent years. Laparoscopic surgery involvesthe use of surgical instruments, with the assistance of atiny camera and video monitor. Laparoscopic proceduresreduce the length of hospital stay, the level of post-opera-tive pain, and the risk of infection. They also leave small-er scars. Laparoscopic splenectomy is not, however, thebest option for many patients.\\nSplenic embolization\\nSplenic embolization is an alternative to splenectomy\\nthat is used in some patients who are poor surgical risks.Embolization involves plugging or blocking the splenicartery to shrink the size of the spleen. The substances thatare injected during this procedure include polyvinyl alco-hol foam, polystyrene, and silicone. Embolization is atechnique that needs further study and refinement.\\nPreparation\\nPreoperative preparation for nonemergency splenec-\\ntomy includes:\\n• Correction of abnormalities of blood clotting and the\\nnumber of red blood cells.\\n• Treatment of any infections.\\n• Control of immune reactions. Patients are usually given\\nprotective vaccinations about a month before surgery.The most common vaccines used are Pneumovax or Pnu-Imune 23 (against pneumococcal infections) and Meno-mune-A/C/Y/W-135 (against meningococcal infections).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3139SplenectomyGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3139'),\n",

Blood transfusions may be indicated for somepatients to replace defective blood cells. The most impor-tant part of aftercare, however, is long-term caution regard-ing vulnerability to infection. Patients should see their doc-tor at once if they have a fever or any other sign of infec-tion, and avoid travel to areas where exposure to malaria\\nor similar diseases is likely. Children with splenectomiesmay be kept on antibiotic therapy until they are 16 yearsold. All patients can be given a booster dose of pneumococ-cal vaccine five to 10 years after splenectomy.\\nRisks\\nThe chief risk following splenectomy is overwhelming\\nbacterial infection, or postsplenectomy sepsis . This vulner-\\nability results from the body’s decreased ability to clearbacteria from the blood, and lowered levels of a protein inblood plasma that helps to fight viruses (immunoglobulinM). The risk of dying from infection after splenectomy ishighest in children, especially in the first two years aftersurgery.

It is located near the stomach on the left side of\\nthe abdomen. A direct blow to the abdomen may bruise,tear or shatter the spleen. Trauma to the spleen can causevarying degrees of damage, the major problem associatedwith internal bleeding. Mild splenic subcapsularhematomas are injuries in which bleeding is limited tosmall areas on and immediately around the spleen. Spleniccontusions refer to bruising and bleeding on and aroundlarger areas of the spleen. Lacerations (tears) are the mostcommon splenic trauma injuries. Tears tend to occur on theareas between the three main blood vessels of the spleen.Because of the abundant blood supply, splenic trauma maycause serious internal bleeding. Most injuries to the spleenin children heal spontaneously. Severe trauma can causethe spleen or its blood vessels to rupture or fragment.\\nSplenic trauma is more common in children than in\\nadults. In general, children are prone to abdominalinjuries due to accidents and falls and because theirabdominal organs are less protected by bone, muscle andfat. Abdominal injuries including splenic trauma are themost common cause of preventable deaths in children.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe most common cause of injury to the spleen is\\nblunt abdominal trauma. Blunt trauma is often causedby a direct blow to the belly, car and motorcycle acci-dents, falls, sports mishaps, and fights. The spleen is themost commonly injured organ from blunt abdominaltrauma. Penetrating injuries such as those from stabbing,gunshot wounds , and accidental impaling also account\\nfor cases of splenic trauma, although far less frequentlythan blunt trauma.\\nIn adults, ruptured spleens may have been preceded\\nby conditions causing splenic enlargement, such as infec-tions, cancer , immune system disorders, diseases of the\\nspleen, or circulatory problems.\\nDamage to the spleen may cause localized or gener-\\nal abdominal pain , tenderness, and swelling. Fractured\\nribs may be present. Splenic trauma may cause mild orsevere internal bleeding, leading to shock and for which\\nsymptoms include rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath ,\\nthirst, pale or clammy skin, weak pulse, low blood pres-sure, dizziness ,fainting , sweating. V omiting blood,\\nblood in the stools or urine, deterioration of vital signs,and loss of consciousness are other symptoms.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe goal of diagnosis of all abdominal traumas is to\\ndetect and treat life-threatening injuries as quickly aspossible. The physician will determine the extent oforgan damage and whether surgery will be necessarywhile providing appropriate emergency care. Initial diag-nosis consists of detailing all circumstances of the injuryfrom the patient and bystanders as well as the closephysical examination of the patient and measurement of\\nvital signs. Blood tests, urinalysis , stool samples and \\nx rays of the chest and abdomen are usually performed.Plain x–rays may show abdominal air pockets that indi-cate internal ruptures, but are rarely helpful because theydo not show splenic and intra-abdominal damage.\\nSeveral other diagnostic tests may be used for the\\nnon-invasive and accurate assessment of splenic damage:computed tomography scans (CT), magnetic reso-\\nnance imaging (MRI), radionuclide scanning, and ultra-\\nsonography. Ultrasonography has now become a standardbedside technique in many hospitals to check for bleedingin the abdomen. Imaging tests allow doctors to determinethe necessity and type of surgery required. The CT scanhas been shown to be the most available and accurate testfor abdominal trauma. MRI tests are accurate but costlyand less available in some hospitals, while radionuclidescanning requires more time and patient stability. Peri-toneal lavage is another diagnostic technique in which theabdominal cavity is entered and flushed to check forbleeding. When patients exhibit shock, infection, or pro-longed internal bleeding, exploratory laparoscopy is used\\nfor emergency diagnosis.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3141Splenic traumaGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3141'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 846}, page_content='Treatment\\nNot long ago nearly all cases of splenic trauma were\\ntreated by laparoscopy, opening the abdomen, and bysplenectomy , the surgical removal of the spleen. This\\napproach resulted from the difficulty in assessing theseverity of the injury, the potential dangers of shock anddeath , and the beliefs that the spleen healed poorly and\\nthat it was not an important organ. Nowadays, improvedtechniques of diagnosis and monitoring, as well asunderstanding that removal of the spleen creates futurerisk of a lowered capacity to fight infection has modifiedtreatment approaches. Research over the past twodecades has shown that the spleen has high healingpotential, and confirmed that children are more suscepti-ble to infection after splenectomy (post splenectomy sep-\\nsis, PSS). PSS has a mortality rate of over 50% and stan-\\ndard procedure now avoids splenectomy as much as pos-sible. Adult splenic trauma is treated by splenectomymore often than children’s; for unknown reasons, theadult spleen more frequently spontaneously rupturesafter injury. Adults are also less susceptible to PSS.\\nNonoperative Treatment\\nIn nonoperative therapy, splenic trauma patients are\\nmonitored closely, often in intensive care units for severaldays. Fluid and blood levels are observed and maintainedby intravenous fluid and possible blood transfusions. Fol-low-up scans may be used to observe the healing process.\\nOperative Treatment\\nSplenic trauma patients require surgery when non-\\noperative treatment fails, when major or prolonged inter-nal bleeding exists and for gunshot and many stabwounds. Whenever possible, surgeons try to preserve atleast part of the spleen and try to repair its blood vessels.\\nPrognosis\\nThe ample blood supply to the spleen can promote\\nrapid healing. Studies have shown that intra-abdominalbleeding associated with splenic trauma stops withoutsurgical intervention in up to two out of three cases inchildren. When trauma patients stabilize during nonoper-ative therapy, chances are high that surgery will be avoid-ed and that spleen injuries will heal themselves.

Infrequently, sporotrichosisaffects the lungs, joints, or central nervous system andcan cause serious illness.\\nDescription\\nThe fungus that causes sporotrichosis is found in\\nspagnum moss, soil, and rotting vegetation. Anyone canget sporotrichosis, but it is most common among nurseryworkers, farm laborers, and gardeners handling spagnummoss, roses, or barberry bushes. Cases have also beenreported in workers whose jobs took them under housesinto crawl spaces contaminated with the fungus. Chil-dren who played on baled hay have also gotten the dis-ease. Sporotrichosis is sometimes called spagnum mossdisease or alcoholic rose gardener’s disease.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe fungus causing sporotrichosis enters the body\\nthrough scratches or cuts in the skin. Therefore, peoplewho handle plants with sharp thorns or needles, likeroses, barberry, or pines, are more likely to get sporotri-chosis. Sporotrichosis is not passed directly from personto person, so it is not possible to catch sporotrichosisfrom another person who has it.\\nThe first signs of sporotrichosis are painless pink,\\nred, or purple bumps usually on the finger, hand, or armwhere the fungus entered the body. These bumps mayappear anywhere from one to 12 weeks after infection,but usually appear within three weeks. Unlike manyother fungal infections sporotrichosis does not causefever or any feelings of general ill health.\\nThe reddish bumps eventually expand and fester,\\ncreating skin ulcers that do not heal. In addition, theinfection often moves to nearby lymph nodes. Althoughmost cases of sporotrichosis are limited to the skin andlymph channels, occasionally the joints, lungs, and cen-tral nervous system become infected. In rare cases, death\\nmay result.\\nPeople who have weakened immune systems,\\neither from a disease such as acquired immune defi-ciency Syndrome ( AIDS ) or leukemia, or as the result\\nof medications they take ( corticosteroids ,chemother-\\napydrugs), are more likely to get sporotrichosis and are\\nmore at risk for the disease to spread to the internalorgans. Alcoholics and people with diabetes mellitus\\nor a pre-existing lung disease are also more likely tobecome infected. Although sporotrichosis is painless, itis important for people with symptoms to see a doctorand receive treatment.Diagnosis\\nThe preferred way to diagnose sporotrichosis is for a\\ndoctor to obtain a sample of fluid from a freshly openedsore and send it to a laboratory to be cultured. The proce-dure is fast and painless. It is possible to confirm thepresence of advanced sporotrichosis through a blood testor a biopsy. Doctors may also take a blood sample to per-form tests that rule out other fungal infections or diseasessuch as tuberculosis or bacterial osteomyelitis .\\nDermatologists and doctors who work with AIDS\\npatients are more likely to have experience in diagnosingsporotrichosis. In at least one state, New York, the labo-ratory test to confirm this disease is provided freethrough the state health department. In other cases, diag-nosis should be covered by health insurance at the samelevel as other diagnostic laboratory tests.\\nTreatment\\nWhen sporotrichosis is limited to the skin and lymph\\nsystem, it is usually treated with a saturated solution ofpotassium iodine that the patient dilutes with water orjuice and drinks several times a day. The iodine solutioncan only be prescribed by a physician. This treatmentmust be continued for many weeks. Skin ulcers shouldbe treated like any open wound and covered with a cleanbandage to prevent a secondary bacterial infection. Thedrug itraconazol (Sporanox), taken orally, is also avail-able to treat sporotrichosis.\\nIn serious cases of sporotrichosis, when the internal\\norgans are infected, the preferred treatment is the drug\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3143Sporotrichosis\\nSporotrichosis is a chronic infection caused by the micro-\\nscopic fungus Sporothrix schenckii .

Strain refers to damage or tearing of a muscle.\\nDescription\\nWhen excessive force is applied to a joint, the liga-\\nments that hold the bones together may be torn or dam-aged. This results in a sprain, and its seriousness dependson how badly the ligaments are torn. Any joint can besprained, but the most frequently injured joints are theankle, knee, and finger.\\nStrains are tears in the muscle. Sometimes called\\npulled muscles, they usually occur because of overexer-tion or improper lifting techniques. Sprains and strainsare common. Anyone can have them.\\nChildren under age eight are less likely to have\\nsprains than are older people. Childrens’ ligaments aretighter, and their bones are more apt to break before a lig-ament tears. People who are active in sports suffer morestrains and sprains than less active people. Repeatedsprains in the same joint make the joint less stable andmore prone to future sprains.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are three grades of sprains. Grade I sprains are\\nmild injuries where there is no tearing of the ligament,and no joint function is lost, although there may be ten-derness and slight swelling.\\nGrade II sprains are caused by a partial tear in the\\nligament. These sprains are characterized by obviousswelling, extensive bruising, pain , difficulty bearing\\nweight, and reduced function of the joint.\\nGrade III, or third degree, sprains are caused by\\ncomplete tearing of the ligament where there is severepain, loss of joint function, widespread swelling andbruising, and the inability to bear weight. These symp-toms are similar to those of bone fractures .\\nStrains can range from mild muscle stiffness to great\\nsoreness. Strains result from overuse of muscles, improp-er use of the muscles, or as the result of injury in anotherpart of the body when the body compensates for pain byaltering the way it moves.\\nDiagnosis\\nGrade I sprains and mild strains are usually self-\\ndiagnosed.

Basic first aid for sprains consists of RICE: Rest,Ice for 48 hours, Compression (wrapping in an elasticbandage), and Elevation of the sprain above the level ofthe heart. Over-the-counter pain medication such asacetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin) can be\\ntaken for pain.\\nIn addition to RICE, people with grade II and grade\\nIII sprains in the ankle or knee usually need to use crutch-es until the sprains have healed enough to bear weight.Sometimes, physical therapy or home exercises are need-ed to restore the strength and flexibility of the joint.\\nGrade III sprains are usually immobilized in a cast\\nfor several weeks to see if the sprain heals. Pain medica-tion is prescribed. Surgery may be necessary to relievepain and restore function. Athletic people under age 40are the most likely candidates for surgery, especially withgrade III knee sprains. For complete healing, physicaltherapy usually will follow surgery.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative practitioners endorse RICE and conven-\\ntional treatments. In addition, nutritional therapists recom-mend vitamin C and bioflavonoids to supplement a diethigh in whole grains, fresh fruits, and vegetables. Anti-inflammatories, such as bromelain (a proteolytic enzymefrom pineapples) and tumeric ( Curcuma longa ), may also\\nbe helpful. The homeopathic remedy arnica ( Arnica mon-\\ntana) may be used initially for a few days, followed by\\nruta ( Ruta graveolens ) for joint-related injuries or Rhus\\ntoxicodendron for muscle-related injuries. If surgery is\\nneeded, alternative practitioners can recommend pre- andpost-surgical therapies that will enhance healing.\\nPrognosis\\nModerate sprains heal within two to four weeks, but\\nit can take months to recover from severe ligament tears.Until recently, tearing the ligaments of the knee meantthe end to an athlete’s career. Improved surgical andrehabilitative techniques now offer the possibility ofcomplete recovery. However, once a joint has beensprained, it will never be as strong as it was before.\\nPrevention\\nSprains and strains can be prevented by warming-up\\nbefore exercising, using proper lifting techniques, wear-ing properly fitting shoes, and taping or bracing the joint.KEY TERMS\\nLigament —Tough, fibrous connective tissue that\\nholds bones together at joints.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBurton Goldberg Group. “Sprains.” In Alternative Medicine:\\nThe Definitive Guide , ed.

For all culture types, the sputummust be collected into a sterile container. The sputumspecimen must be collected carefully, so that bacteriathat normally live in the mouth and saliva don’t contami-nate the sputum and complicate the process of identify-ing the cause of the infectious agent. Once in the labora-tory, each culture type is handled differently.\\nBacterial culture\\nA portion of the sputum is smeared on a microscope\\nslide for a Gram stain. Another portion is spread overthe surface of several different types of culture plates,and placed in an incubator at body temperature for oneto two days.\\nA Gram stain is done by staining the slide with pur-\\nple and red stains, then examining it under a microscope.Gram staining checks that the specimen does not containsaliva or material from the mouth. If many epithelial(skin) cells and few white blood cells are seen, the speci-men is not pure sputum and is not adequate for culture.Depending on laboratory policy, the specimen may berejected and a new specimen requested. If many whiteblood cells and bacteria of one type are seen, this is anearly confirmation of infection. The color of stain pickedup by the bacteria (purple or red), their shape (such asround or rectangular), and their size provide valuableclues as to their identity and helps the physician predictwhat antibiotics might work best before the entire test iscompleted. Bacteria that stain purple are called gram-positive; those that stain red are called gram-negative.\\nDuring incubation, bacteria present in the sputum\\nsample multiply and will appear on the plates as visiblecolonies. The bacteria are identified by the appearance oftheir colonies, by the results of biochemical tests, andthrough a Gram stain of part of a colony.\\nA sensitivity test, also called antibiotic susceptibility\\ntest, is also done. The bacteria are tested against differentantibiotics to determine which will treat the infection bykilling the bacteria.\\nThe initial result of the Gram stain is available the\\nsame day, or in less than an hour if requested by thephysician. An early report, known as a preliminaryreport, is usually available after one day. This report willtell if any bacteria have been found yet, and if so, theirGram stain appearance—for example, a gram-negativerod, or a gram-positive cocci. The final report, usuallyavailable in one to three days, includes complete identifi-cation and an estimate of the quantity of the bacteria anda list of the antibiotics to which they are sensitive.Fungal culture\\nTo look for mold or yeast, a fungal culture is done.\\nThe sputum sample is spread on special culture plates thatwill encourage the growth of mold and yeast. Differentbiochemical tests and stains are used to identify moldsand yeast. Cultures for fungi may take several weeks.\\nViral culture\\nViruses are a common cause of pneumonia. For a viral\\nculture, sputum is mixed with commercially-prepared ani-mal cells in a test tube. Characteristic changes to the cellscaused by the growing virus help identify the virus. Thetime to complete a viral culture varies with the type ofvirus. It may take from several days to several weeks.\\nSpecial procedures\\nTuberculosis is caused by a slow-growing bacteria\\ncalled Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Because it does not\\neasily grow using routine culture methods, special proce-dures are used to grow and identify this bacteria. When asputum sample for tuberculosis first comes into the labo-ratory, a small portion of the sputum is smeared on amicroscope slide and stained with a special stain, calledan acid-fast stain. The stained sputum is examined undera microscope for tuberculosis organisms, which pick-upthe stain, making them visible. This smear is a rapidscreen for the organism, and allows the physician toreceive a preliminary report within 24 hours.\\nTo culture for tuberculosis, portions of the sputum\\nare spread on and placed into special culture plates andtubes of broth that promote the growth of the organism.Growth in broth is faster than growth on culture plates.Instruments are available that can detect growth in broth,speeding the process even further. Growth and identifica-tion may take two to four weeks.\\nOther microorganisms that cause various types of\\nlower respiratory tract infections also require special cul-ture procedures to grow and identify. Mycoplasma pneu-\\nmonia causes a mild to moderate form of pneumonia,\\ncommonly called walking pneumonia; Bordetella pertus-\\nsiscauses whooping cough ; Legionella pneumophila ,\\nLegionnaire’s disease; Chlamydia pneumoniae , an atypi-\\ncal pneumonia; and Chlamydia psittaci ,parrot fever .\\nPneumocystis carnii causes pneumonia in people with\\nweakened immune systems, such as people with AIDS .\\nThis organism does not grow in culture. Special stains aredone on sputum when pneumonia caused by this organismis suspected.

There are as many as 400species in the genus, which is part of the Guttiferae family.Native to Europe, St. John’s wort is found throughout theworld. It thrives in sunny fields, open woods, and gravellyroadsides. Early colonists brought this valuable medicinalto North America, and the plant has become naturalized inthe eastern United States and California, as well as in Aus-tralia, New Zealand, eastern Asia, and South America.\\nThe entire plant, particularly the round, black seed,\\nexudes a slight, turpentine-like odor. The woody, branchedroot spreads from the base with runners that producenumerous stalks. The simple, dark green leaves are veinedand grow in opposite, oblong-obvate pairs on round,branching stalks that reach 3 ft (91.4 cm) high. Tiny holes,visible when the leaf is held to the light, are actually trans-parent oil glands containing the chemical photo sensitizerknown as hypericin. These characteristic holes inspired thespecies name, perforatum , Latin for perforated. The bright\\nyellow, star-shaped flowers, often clustered in a trio, havefive petals. Each blossom has many showy stamens. Blackdots along the margins of the blossom contain more of thered-pigmented chemical hypericin. The herb is also usefulas a dye. The flowers bloom in branching, flat-toppedclusters atop the stalks in mid-summer, around the time ofthe summer solstice. St. John’s wort, sometimes calleddevil’s flight or grace of God, was believed to have magi-cal properties to ward off evil spirits. It’s generic namehypericum is derived from a Greek word meaning “overan apparition.” The herb was traditionally gathered onmid-summer’s eve, June 23. This date was later christian-ized as the eve of the feast day of St. John the Baptist. Thisfolk custom gave the plant its popular name. The Anglo-Saxon word wort means medicinal herb.\\nPurpose\\nSt. John’s wort has been known for its numerous\\nmedicinal properties as far back as Roman times. It was avalued remedy on the Roman battlefields where it wasused to promote healing from trauma and inflammation.The herb is vulnerary and can speed the healing ofwounds ,bruises , ulcers, and burns . It is popularly used\\nas a nervine for its calming effect, easing tension andanxiety , relieving mild depression, and soothing emo-\\ntions during menopause . The bittersweet herb is licensed\\nin Germany for use in cases of mild depression, anxiety,and sleeplessness. It is useful in circumstances of nerveinjury and trauma, and has been used to speed healingafter brain surgery. Its antispasmodic properties can easeuterine cramping and menstrual difficulties. St. John’swort acts medicinally as an astringent, and may also beused as an expectorant. The hypericin in St. John’s wortpossesses anti-viral properties that may be active in com-bating certain cancers, including many brain cancers. Aninfusion of the plant, taken as a tea, has been helpful intreating night-time incontinence in children. The oil,taken internally, has been used to treat colic , intestinal\\nworms, and abdominal pain . The medicinal parts of St.\\nJohn’s wort are the fresh leaves and flowers.

Commercially prepared\\nextracts are commonly standardized to 0.3% hypericin.\\nClinical studies\\nA 1988 study at New York University found the\\nantiviral properties in hypericin, a chemical componentof Hypericum, to be useful in combating the virus thatcauses AIDS . Additional studies are under way through\\nthe Federal Drug Administration (FDA) to determine theeffectiveness of the herb as a treatment for AIDS. Hyper-icin extract has also been reported to inhibit a form ofleukemia that sometimes occurs after radiation therapy .\\nNumerous clinical studies have found hypericum prepa-rations to have an antidepressive effect when used instandardized extracts for treatment of mild depression.Clinical trials continue with this important herbal anti-depressant, particularly in view of its relative lack ofundesirable side effects in humans.\\nPreparations\\nAn oil extract can be purchased commercially or\\nprepared by combining fresh flowers and leaves of St.John’s wort in a glass jar and sunflower or olive oil.Seal the container with an airtight lid and leave on asunny windowsill for four to six weeks, shaking daily.The oil will absorb the red pigment. Strain throughmuslin or cheesecloth, and store in a dark container.The medicinal oil will maintain its potency for twoyears or more. The oil of St. John’s wort has beenknown in folk culture as “Oil of Jesus.” This oil makesa good rub for painful joints, varicose veins , muscle\\nstrain, arthritis, and rheumatism. Used in a compress itcan help to heal wounds and inflammation, and relievethe pain of deep bruising.\\nAn infusion is made by pouring one pint of boiling\\nwater over 1 oz (28 g) of dried herb, or 2 oz (57 g) of fresh,minced flower and leaf. Steep in a glass or enamel pot forfive to 10 minutes. Strain and cover. Drink the tea warm. A\\ngeneral dose is one cupful, up to three times daily.\\nCapsule: Dry the leaves and flowers and grind with\\nmortar and pestle into a fine powder. Place in gelatin cap-sules. The potency of the herb varies with the soil, cli-mate and harvesting conditions of the plant. A standard-ized extract of 0.3% hypericin extract, commercially pre-pared from a reputable source, is more likely to yieldreliable results. Standard dosage is up to three 300 mgcapsules of 0.3% standardized extract daily.\\nA tincture is prepared by combining one part fresh\\nherb to three parts alcohol (50% alcohol/water solution)in glass container. Set aside in dark place, shaking themixture daily for two weeks. Strain through muslin orcheesecloth, and store in dark bottle. The tincture shouldmaintain potency for two years. Standard dosage, unlessotherwise prescribed, is 0.24–1 tsp added to 8 oz (237ml) of water, up to three times daily.\\nA salve is made by warming 2 oz (59 ml) of pre-\\npared oil extract in double boiler. Once warmed, 1 oz (28g) of grated beeswax is added and mixed until melted.Pour into a glass jar and cool. The salve can be stored forup to one year. The remedy keeps best if refrigeratedafter preparation. The salve is useful in treating burns,wounds, and soothing painful muscles. It is also a goodskin softener. St. John’s wort salve may be prepared incombination with calendula extract ( Calendula offici-\\nnalis ) for application on bruises.\\nPrecautions\\nConsult a physician prior to use. Pregnant or lactat-\\ning women should not use the herb. Individuals takingprescribed psychotropic medications classified as selec-\\ntive serotonin reuptake inhibitors , or SSRI, such as\\nProzac, should not simultaneously use St. John’s wort.Many herbalists also discourage use of St. John’s wort byindividuals taking any other anti-depressant medication.\\nCattlemen dislike the shrub because there have been\\nsome reports of toxicity to livestock that over-graze infields abundant with the wild herb. Toxic effects in live-stock include reports of edema of the ears, eyelids, and\\nthe face due to photosensitization after ingestion of theherb. Exposure to sunlight activates the hypercin in theplant. Adverse effects have been reported in horses,sheep, and swine and include staggering, and blisteringand peeling of the skin.

In addition, it is sometimesincluded in neuropsychological testing to assess the brainfunction of individuals with neurological impairments.\\nPrecautions\\nAlthough the Stanford-Binet was developed for chil-\\ndren as young as two, examiners should be cautious inusing the test to screen very young children for develop-mental delays or disabilities. The test cannot be used todiagnose mental retardation in children aged three and\\nunder, and the scoring design may not detect develop-mental problems in preschool-age children.\\nIntelligence testing requires a clinically trained\\nexaminer. The Stanford-Binet intelligence scale shouldbe administered and interpreted by a trained profession-al, preferably a psychologist.\\nDescription\\nThe Stanford-Binet intelligence scale is a direct\\ndescendent of the Binet-Simon scale, the first intelligencescale created in 1905 by psychologist Alfred Binet andDr. Theophilus Simon. This revised edition, released in1986, was designed with a larger, more diverse, represen-tative sample to minimize the gender and racial inequitiesthat had been criticized in earlier versions of the test.\\nThe Stanford-Binet scale tests intelligence across four\\nareas: verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, abstract/visual reasoning, and short-term memory. The areas arecovered by 15 subtests, including vocabulary, comprehen-sion, verbal absurdities, pattern analysis, matrices, paperfolding and cutting, copying, quantitative, number series,equation building, memory for sentences, memory for dig-its, memory for objects, and bead memory.\\nAll test subjects take an initial vocabulary test,\\nwhich along with the subject’s age, determines the num-ber and level of subtests to be administered. Total testingtime is 45–90 minutes, depending on the subject’s ageand the number of subtests given.

Billing time typicallyincludes test administration, scoring and interpretation,and reporting. Many insurance plans cover all or a por-tion of diagnostic psychological testing.\\nNormal results\\nThe Stanford-Binet is a standardized test, meaning\\nthat norms were established during the design phase ofthe test by administering the test to a large, representativesample of the test population. The test has a mean, oraverage, standard score of 100 and a standard deviationof 16 (subtests have a mean of 50 and a standard devia-tion of 8). The standard deviation indicates how farabove or below the norm the subject’s score is. For exam-ple, an eight-year-old is assessed with the Stanford-Binetscale and achieves a standard age score of 116. The meanscore of 100 is the average level at which all eight-year-olds in the representative sample performed. This child’sscore would be one standard deviation above that norm.\\nWhile standard age scores provide a reference point\\nfor evaluation, they represent an average of a variety ofskill areas. A trained psychologist will evaluate and inter-pret an individual’s performance on the scale’s subteststo discover strengths and weaknesses and offer recom-mendations based upon these findings.Resources\\nBOOKS\\nMaddox, Taddy.

This condi-tion fixes the stapes to the opening of the inner ear, sothat the stapes no longer vibrates properly; therefore, thetransmission of sound to the inner ear is disrupted.Untreated otosclerosis eventually results in total deaf-ness, usually in both ears.\\nDescription\\nWith the patient under local or general anesthesia,\\nthe surgeon opens the ear canal and folds the eardrumforward. Using an operating microscope, the surgeon isable to see the structures in detail, and evaluates thebones of hearing (ossicles) to confirm the diagnosis ofotosclerosis.\\nNext, the surgeon separates the stapes from the\\nincus; freed from the stapes, the incus and malleus bonescan now move when pressed.

The surgeon directs the laser’s beam atthe window to make a tiny opening, and gently clips theprosthesis to the incus bone. A piece of tissue is takenfrom a small incision behind the ear lobe and used tohelp seal the hole in the window and around the prosthe-sis. The eardrum is then gently replaced and repaired,and held there by absorbable packing ointment or agelatin sponge. The procedure usually takes about anhour and a half.\\nGood candidates for the surgery are those who have\\na fixed stapes from otosclerosis, and a conductive hear-ing loss at least 20 dB. Patients with a severe hearing lossmight still benefit from a stapedectomy, if only toimprove their hearing to the point where a hearing aidcan be of help. The procedure can improve hearing inmore than 90% of cases.\\nPreparation\\nPrior to admission to the hospital, the patient will be\\ngiven a hearing test to measure the degree of deafness,and a full ear, nose, and throat exam.\\nMost surgeons prefer to use general anesthesia; in\\nthis case, an injection will be given to the patient beforesurgery.\\nAftercare\\nThe patient is usually discharged the morning after\\nsurgery. Antibiotics are given up to five days after\\nsurgery to prevent infection; packing and sutures areremoved about a week after surgery.It is important that the patient not put pressure on the\\near for a few days after surgery. Blowing one’s nose, lift-ing heavy objects, swimming underwater, descendingrapidly in high-rise elevators, or taking an airplane flightshould be avoided.\\nRight after surgery, the ear is usually quite sensitive,\\nso the patient should avoid loud noises until the earretrains itself to hear sounds properly.\\nIt is extremely important that the patient avoid get-\\nting the ear wet until it has completely healed. Water inthe ear could cause an infection; most seriously, watercould enter the middle ear and cause an infection withinthe inner ear, which could then lead to a complete hear-ing loss. When taking a shower, and washing the hair,the patient should plug the ear with a cotton ball orlamb’s wool ball, soaked in Vaseline. The surgeonshould give specific instructions about when and howthis can be done.\\nUsually, the patient may return to work and normal\\nactivities about a week after leaving the hospital,although if the patient’s job involves heavy lifting, threeweeks of home rest is recommend.

TurkingtonStaphylococcal infections\\nDefinition\\nStaphylococcal (staph) infections are communicable\\nconditions caused by certain bacteria and generally char-acterized by the formation of abscesses. They are theleading cause of primary infections originating in hospi-tals (nosocomial infections) in the United States.\\nDescription\\nClassified since the early twentieth century as\\namong the deadliest of all disease-causing organisms,staph exists on the skin or inside the nostrils of 20–30%of healthy people. It is sometimes found in breast tissue,the mouth, and the genital, urinary, and upper respirato-ry tracts.\\nAlthough staph bacteria are usually harmless, when\\ninjury or a break in the skin enables the organisms toinvade the body and overcome the body’s natural defens-es, consequences can range from minor discomfort todeath . Infection is most apt to occur in:\\n• newborns\\n• women who are breastfeeding• individuals whose immune systems have been under-\\nmined by radiation treatments, chemotherapy , or med-\\nication\\n• intravenous drug users\\n• those with surgical incisions, skin disorders, and seri-\\nous illness like cancer , diabetes, and lung disease\\nTypes of infections\\nStaph infections produce pus-filled pockets (abscess-\\nes) located just beneath the surface of the skin or deepwithin the body. Risk of infection is greatest among thevery young and the very old.\\nA localized staph infection is confined to a ring of\\ndead and dying white blood cells and bacteria. The skinabove it feels warm to the touch. Most of these abscesseseventually burst, and pus that leaks onto the skin cancause new infections.\\nA small fraction of localized staph infections enter\\nthe bloodstream and spread through the body. In chil-dren, these systemic (affecting the whole body) or dis-seminated infections frequently affect the ends of thelong bones of the arms or legs, causing a bone infectioncalled osteomyelitis . When adults develop invasive staph\\ninfections, bacteria are most apt to cause abscesses of thebrain, heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, or spleen.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3156Staphylococcal infectionsGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3156'),\n",

Or they penetrate skin dam-aged by burns , cuts and scrapes, infection, insect bites,\\nor wounds .\\nMultiplying beneath the skin, bacteria infect and\\ndestroy tissue in the area where they entered the body. Staphinfection of the blood (staphylococcal bacteremia) developswhen bacteria from a local infection infiltrate the lymphglands and bloodstream. These infections, which can usual-ly be traced to contaminated catheters or intravenousdevices, usually cause persistent high fever. They may causeshock. They also can cause death within a short time.\\nWarning signs\\nCommon symptoms of staph infection include:\\n• pain or swelling around a cut, or an area of skin that has\\nbeen scraped\\n• boils or other skin abscesses• blistering, peeling, or scaling of the skin; this is most\\ncommon in infants and young children\\n• enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, or groin.\\nA family physician should be notified whenever:• Lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, or groin become\\nswollen or tender.\\n• An area of skin that has been cut or scraped becomes\\npainful or swollen, feels hot, or produces pus. Thesesymptoms may mean the infection has spread to thebloodstream.\\n• A boil or carbuncle appears on any part of the face or\\nspine. Staph infections affecting these areas can spreadto the brain or spinal cord.\\n• A boil becomes very sore. Usually a sign that infection\\nhas spread, this condition may be accompanied byfever, chills, and red streaks radiating from the site ofthe original infection.\\n• Boils that develop repeatedly. This type of recurrent\\ninfection could be a symptom of diabetes.\\nDiagnosis\\nBlood tests that show unusually high concentrations\\nof white blood cells can suggest staph infection, but diag-nosis is based on laboratory analysis of material removedfrom pus-filled sores, and on analysis of normally unin-fected body fluids, such as, blood and urine. Also, x rayscan enable doctors to locate internal abscesses and esti-mate the severity of infection. Needle biopsy (removingtissue with a needle, then examining it under a micro-scope) may be used to assess bone involvement.\\nTreatment\\nSuperficial staph infections can generally be cured\\nby keeping the area clean, using soaps that leave a germ-killing film on the skin, and applying warm, moist com-presses to the affected area for 20–30 minutes three orfour times a day.\\nSevere or recurrent infections may require a seven to\\n10 day course of treatment with penicillin or other oralantibiotics . The location of the infection and the identity\\nof the causal bacteria determines which of several effec-tive medications should be prescribed.\\nIn case of a more serious infection, antibiotics may\\nbe administered intravenously for as long as six weeks.Intravenous antibiotics are also used to treat staph infec-tions around the eyes or on other parts of the face.\\nSurgery may be required to drain or remove abscess-\\nes that form on internal organs, or on shunts or otherdevices implanted inside the body.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative therapies for staph infection are meant to\\nstrengthen the immune system and prevent recurrences.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3158Staphylococcal infections\\nA micrographic image of Staphylococcus aureus.

Herbs that may help the body overcome, or with-stand, staph infection include:\\n• Garlic ( Allium sativum ). This herb is believed to have\\nanitbacterial properties. Herbalists recommend con-suming three garlic cloves or three garlic oil capsules aday, starting when symptoms of infection first appear.\\n• Cleavers ( Galium aparine ). This anti-inflammatory\\nherb is believed to support the lymphatic system. It maybe taken internally to help heal staph abscesses andreduce swelling of the lymph nodes. A cleavers com-press can also be applied directly to a skin infection.\\n• Goldenseal ( Hydrastis canadensis ). Another herb\\nbelieved to fight infection and reduce imflammation,goldenseal may be taken internally when symptoms ofinfection first appear. Skin infections can be treated bymaking a paste of water and powdered goldenseal rootand applying it directly to the affected area.

Others develop repeat-ed infections. Some become seriously ill, requiring long-term therapy or emergency care. A small percentage die.\\nPrevention\\nHealthcare providers and patients should always\\nwash their hands thoroughly with warm water and soapafter treating a staph infection or touching an openwound or the pus it produces. Pus that oozes onto theskin from the site of an infection should be removedimmediately. This affected area should then be cleansedwith antiseptic or with antibacterial soap.To prevent infection from spreading from one part of\\nthe body to another, it is important to shower rather thanbathe during the healing process. Because staph infectionis easily transmitted from one member of a household toothers, towels, washcloths, and bed linens used by some-one with a staph infection should not be used by anyoneelse. They should be changed daily until symptoms disap-pear, and laundered separately in hot water with bleach.\\nChildren should frequently be reminded not to\\nshare:\\n• brushes, combs, or hair accessories\\n• caps\\n• clothing\\n• sleeping bags\\n• sports equipment\\n• other personal items\\nA diet rich in green, yellow, and orange vegetables\\ncan bolster natural immunity. A doctor or nutritionistmay recommend vitamins or mineral supplements to\\ncompensate for specific dietary deficiencies. Drinkingeight to 10 glasses of water a day can help flush disease-causing organisms from the body.\\nBecause some strains of staph bacteria are known to\\ncontaminate artificial limbs, prosthetic devices implantedwithin the body, and tubes used to administer medicationor drain fluids from the body, catheters and other devicesshould be removed on a regular basis, if possible, andexamined for microscopic signs of staph.

Clusters of SSSS cases (epi-demics) can occur in newborn nurseries, when staff inthose nurseries accidentally pass the causative bacteriabetween patients. It can also strike other age groups whohave weakened immune systems. Such immunocompro-mised patients include those with kidney disease, peopleundergoing cancerchemotherapy , organ transplant\\npatients, and individuals with acquired immunodeficien-cy syndrome ( AIDS ).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSSSS is caused by a type of bacteria called Staphy-\\nlococcus aureus . This bacteria produces a chemical\\ncalled an epidermolytic toxin ( “epiderm,” deriving fromthe Greek words epi,meaning on, and derma, meaning\\nskin, refers to the top layer of skin; “-lytic,” derivingfrom the Greek word lysis, which literally denotes the act\\nof undoing, means breaking or destroying; a toxin is apoison). While the bacteria itself is not spread throughoutthe body, it affects all of the skin by sending this toxinthrough the bloodstream.\\nSSSS begins with a small area of infection. In new-\\nborn babies, this may appear as a crusted area around theumbilicus, or in the diaper area. In children between theages of one and six, a small, red, crusty bump appearsnear the nose or ear. The child may have no energy, andmay have a fever . The skin becomes sensitive and\\nuncomfortable even before the rash is fully visible. Therash starts out as bright red patches around the originalarea of crusting. Blisters may appear, and the skin maylook wrinkled. When the blisters pop, they leave pittedareas. Even gently touching these red patches of skinmay cause them to peel away in jagged sheets. The skinbelow is shiny, moist, and bright pink. Within a day ortwo, the top layer of skin all over the body is peeling offin large sheets.\\nThe dangers of this illness include the chance that a\\ndifferent kind of bacteria will invade through the openareas in the skin and cause a serious systemic infection(sepsis ). A lot of body fluid is lost as the skin peels away,\\nand the layer underneath dries. Dehydration is a danger\\nat this point.\\nDiagnosis\\nAlthough good patient care includes taking speci-\\nmens of blister fluid and smears from the nose or throat,no bacteria are usually demonstrated. SSSS is usuallydiagnosed on the basis of the typical progression ofsymptoms in a child of this age, prone to this disorder. Asample of skin ( skin biopsy ) should be taken, prepared,\\nand examined under a microscope. If the patient’s dis-ease is truly SSSS, the biopsy will show a characteristicappearance. There will be no accumulation of those cellsusually present in the case of a bacterial infection.Instead, there will be evidence of disruption of only thetop layer of skin (epidermis).\\nTreatment\\nTreatment involves careful attention to avoid the\\ndevelopment of dehydration. A variety of lotions andcreams are available to apply to areas where the epider-mis has peeled away. This both soothes the sensitiveareas, and protects against drying and further moistureloss.\\nPrognosis\\nMost patients heal from SSSS within about 10–14\\ndays. Healing occurs without scarring in the majority ofpatients. Death may occur if severe dehydration or sepsis\\ncomplicate the illness. About 3% of children die of thesecomplications; about 50% of immunocompromisedadults die of these complications.\\nPrevention\\nAs always, good hygiene can prevent the passage of\\nthe causative bacteria between people. In the event of anoutbreak in a newborn nursery, members of the staffshould have nasal smears taken to identify an adult whomay be unknowingly carrying the bacteria and passing iton to the babies.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3160Staphylococcal scalded skin synddromeGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3160'),\n",

It is possibleto ingest enough energy without a well-balanced selectionof individual nutrients and produce diseases that arenoticeably different from those resulting from an overallinsufficiency of nutrients and energy. Although all foodsare a source of energy for the organism, it is possible toconsume a seemingly adequate amount of food withoutgetting the required minimum of energy (calories). Forexample, marasmus is the result of a diet that is deficientmainly in energy. Children who get enough calories, butnot enough protein have kwashiorkor. This is typical incultures with a limited variety of foods that eat mostly asingle staple carbohydrate like maize or rice. These con-ditions overlap and are associated with multiple vitaminand mineral deficits, most of which have specific namesand set of problems associated with them.\\n• Marasmus produces a very skinny child with stunted\\ngrowth.\\n• Children with kwashiorkor have body fat, an enlarged\\nliver, and edema—swelling from excess water in thetissues. They also have growth retardation.\\n• Niacin deficiency produces pellagra characterized by\\ndiarrhea , skin rashes , brain dysfunction, tongue,\\nmouth and vaginal irritation, and trouble swallowing.\\n• Thiamine (Vitamin B\\n1) deficiency causes beriberi ,\\nwhich can appear as heart failure and edema , a brain\\nand nerve disease, or both.\\n• Riboflavin deficiency causes a sore mouth and throat, a\\nskin rash, and anemia.\\n• Lack of vitamin C (ascorbic acid)—scurvy—causes hair\\ndamage, bleeding under the skin, in muscles and joints,gum disease, poor wound healing, and in severe casesconvulsions, fever , loss of blood pressure, and death .\\n• Vitamin B\\n12is needed to keep the nervous system work-\\ning right, and it and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) are both\\nnecessary for blood formation.\\n• Vitamin A deficiency causes at first loss of night vision\\nand eventually blindness from destruction of thecornea, a disease called keratomalacia.\\n• Vitamin K is necessary for blood clotting.\\n• Vitamin D regulates calcium balance. Without it, chil-\\ndren get rickets and adults get osteomalacia.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nStarvation is caused by a number of factors. They\\ninclude:\\n• anorexia nervosa\\n• fasting• coma\\n• stroke• famine• severe gastrointestinal disease\\nSince the body will combat malnutrition by break-\\ning down its own fat and eventually its own tissue, awhole host of symptoms can appear.

Loss of resistance to infec-tion follows next, along with poor wound healing. Thereis also progressive weakness and difficulty swallowing,which may lead to inhaling food. At the same time, thesigns of specific nutrient deficiencies may appear.\\nTreatment\\nIf the degree of malnutrition is severe, the intestines\\nmay not tolerate a fully balanced diet. They may, in fact,not be able to absorb adequate nutrition at all. Carefullyprepared elemental diets or intravenous feeding must\\nbegin the treatment. The treatment back to health is longand first begins with liquids.

The stomach pro-duces many digestive juices and acids that mix with foodand aid in the process of digestion. There are five regionsof the stomach that doctors refer to when determining theorigin of stomach cancer. These are:\\n• the cardia, area surrounding the cardiac sphincter\\nwhich controls movement of food from the esophagusinto the stomach\\n• the fundus, upper expanded area adjacent to the cardiac\\nregion\\n• the antrum, lower region of the stomach where it begins\\nto narrow\\n• the prepyloric, region just before or nearest the pylorus• and the pylorus, the terminal region where the stomach\\njoins the small intestine\\nCancer can develop in any of the five sections of the\\nstomach. Symptoms and outcomes of the disease willvary depending on the location of the cancer.\\nBased on previous data from the National Cancer\\nInstitute and the United States Census, the AmericanCancer Society estimates that 21,700 Americans will bediagnosed with stomach cancer during 2001 and approxi-mately 13,000 deaths will result from the disease. Inmost areas, men are affected by stomach cancer nearlytwice as often as women. Most cases of stomach cancerare diagnosed between the ages of 50 and 70, but in fami-lies with a hereditary risk of stomach cancer, youngercases are more frequently seen.\\nStomach cancer is one of the leading causes of can-\\ncer deaths in several areas of the world, most notablyJapan and other Asian countries. In Japan it appearsalmost ten times as frequently as in the United States.The number of new stomach cancer cases is decreasingin some areas, however, especially in developed coun-tries. In the United States, incidence rates have droppedfrom 30 individuals per 100,000 in the 1930s, to only 8in 100,000 individuals developing stomach cancer by the1980s. The use of refrigerated foods and increased con-sumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, instead of pre-served foods with high salt content, may be a reason forthe decline.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nWhile the exact cause for stomach cancer has not\\nbeen identified, several potential factors have lead toincreased numbers of individuals developing the dis-ease and therefore, significant risk has been associated.Diet, work environment, exposure to the bacteriumHelicobacter pylori , and a history of stomach disorders\\nsuch as ulcers or polyps are some of these believedcauses.\\nStudies have shown that eating foods with high\\nquantities of salt and nitrites increases the risk of stom-ach cancer. The diet in a specific region can have a greatimpact on its residents. Making changes to the types offoods consumed has been shown to decrease likelihoodof disease, even for individuals from countries with high-er risk. For example, Japanese people who move to theUnited States or Europe and change the types of foodsthey eat have a far lower chance of developing the dis-ease than do Japanese people who remain in Japan anddo not change their dietary habits. Eating recommendedamounts of fruit and vegetables may lower a person’schances of developing this cancer.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3164Stomach cancerKEY TERMS\\nAlpha-fetoprotein analysis —A blood test that can\\nbe done after the sixteenth week of pregnancy toevaluate the possibility of spina bifida and otherbirth defects in the fetus.\\nElectronic fetal nonstress test —A test in which\\nelectronic monitors attached to the mother’sabdomen to detect contractions of the uterus aswell as the baby’s heartbeat and movements.\\nMiscarriage —The spontaneous end of a pregnan-\\ncy before the twentieth week.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 869}, page_content='A high risk for developing stomach cancers has been\\nlinked to certain industries as well. The best proven asso-ciation is between stomach cancer and persons who workin coal mining and those who work processing timber,nickel, and rubber. An unusually large number of theseworkers have been diagnosed with this form of cancer.\\nSeveral studies have identified a bacterium ( Heli-\\ncobacter pylori ) that causes stomach ulcers (inflammation\\nin the inner lining of the stomach). Chronic (long-term)infection of the stomach with these bacteria may lead to aparticular type of cancer (lymphomas or mucosa-associat-ed lymphoid tissue [MALT]) in the stomach.\\nAnother risk factor is the development of polyps,\\nbenign growths in the lining of the stomach. Althoughpolyps are not cancerous, some may have the potential toturn cancerous. People in blood group A are also at ele-vated risk for this cancer for unknown reasons. Otherspeculative causes of stomach cancer include previousstomach surgery for ulcers or other conditions, or a formof anemia known as pernicious anemia .\\nStomach cancer is a slow-growing cancer. It may be\\nyears before the tumor grows very large and producesdistinct symptoms. In the early stages of the disease, thepatient may only have mild discomfort, indigestion ,\\nheartburn , a bloated feeling after eating, and mild nau-\\nsea. In the advanced stages, a patient will have loss ofappetite and resultant weight loss, stomach pains, vomit-ing, difficulty in swallowing, and blood in the stool.Stomach cancer often spreads (metastasizes) to adjoin-ing organs such as the esophagus, adjacent lymph nodes,liver, or colon.\\nDiagnosis\\nUnfortunately, many patients diagnosed with stom-\\nach cancer experience pain for two or three years\\nbefore informing a doctor of their symptoms. When adoctor suspects stomach cancer from the symptomsdescribed by the patient, a complete medical historywill be taken to check for any risk factors. A thoroughphysical examination will be conducted to assess all\\nthe symptoms. Laboratory tests may be ordered tocheck for blood in the stool ( fecal occult blood test )\\nand anemia (low red blood cell count), which oftenaccompany gastric cancer.\\nIn some countries, such as Japan, it is appropriate\\nfor patients to be given routine screening examinationsfor stomach cancer, as the risk of developing cancer inthat society is very high. Such screening might be usefulfor all high-risk populations. Due to the low prevalenceof stomach cancer in the United States, routine screeningis usually not recommended unless a family history ofthe disease exists.Whether as a screening test or because a doctor sus-\\npects a patient may have symptoms of stomach cancer,endoscopy or barium x rays are used in diagnosing stom-ach cancer. For a barium x ray of the upper gastrointesti-nal tract, the patient is given a chalky, white solution ofbarium sulfate to drink. This solution coats the esopha-gus, the stomach, and the small intestine. Air may bepumped into the stomach after the barium solution inorder to get a clearer picture. Multiple x rays are thentaken. The barium coating helps to identify any abnor-malities in the lining of the stomach.\\nIn another more frequently used test, known as upper\\ngastrointestinal endoscopy, a thin, flexible, lighted tube(endoscope) is passed down the patient’s throat and intothe stomach. The doctor can view the lining of the esoph-agus and the stomach through the tube. Sometimes, asmall ultrasound probe is attached at the end of the endo-scope. This probe sends high frequency sound waves thatbounce off the stomach wall.

This pro-cedure is known as an endoscopic ultrasound or EUS.\\nEndoscopy has several advantages, in that the physi-\\ncian is able to see any abnormalities directly. In addition,if any suspicious-looking patches are seen, biopsy for-ceps can be passed painlessly through the tube to collectsome tissue for microscopic examination. This is knownas a biopsy. EUS is beneficial because it can providevaluable information on depth of tumor invasion.\\nAfter stomach cancer has been diagnosed and before\\ntreatment starts, another type of x-ray scan is taken. Com-puted tomography (CT) is an imaging procedure that pro-duces a three-dimensional picture of organs or structuresinside the body. CT scans are used to obtain additionalinformation in regard to how large the tumor is and whatparts of the stomach it borders; whether the cancer hasspread to the lymph nodes; and whether it has spread todistant parts of the body (metastasized), such as the liver,lung, or bone. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvisis taken. If the tumor has gone through the wall of thestomach and extends to the liver, pancreas, or spleen, theCT will often show this. Although a CT scan is an effec-tive way of evaluating whether cancer has spread to someof the lymph nodes, it is less effective than EUS in evaluat-ing whether the nodes closest to the stomach are free ofcancer. However, CT scans, like barium x rays, have theadvantage of being less invasive than upper endoscopy.\\nLaparoscopy is another procedure used to stage some\\npatients with stomach cancer. This involves a medicaldevice similar to an endoscope. A laparoscopy is a mini-mally invasive surgery technique with one or a few smallincisions, which can be performed on an outpatient basis,followed by rapid recovery. Patients who may receive radi-\\nation therapy or chemotherapy before surgery may\\nundergo a laparoscopic procedure to determine the precisestage of cancer. The patient with bone pain or with certainlaboratory results should be given a bone scan.\\nBenign gastric neoplasms are tumors of the stomach\\nthat cause no major harm. One of the most common iscalled a submucosal leiomyoma. If a leiomyoma starts tobleed, surgery should be performed to remove it. Howev-er, many leiomyomas require no treatment. Diagnosis ofstomach cancers should be conducted carefully so that ifthe tumor does not require treatment the patient is notsubjected to a surgical operation.\\nTreatment\\nMore than 95% of stomach cancers are caused by\\nadenocarcinomas, malignant cancers that originate inglandular tissues. The remaining 5% of stomach cancersinclude lymphomas and other types of cancers. It is impor-\\ntant that gastric lymphomas be accurately diagnosedbecause these cancers have a much better prognosis thanstomach adenocarcinomas. Approximately half of the peo-ple with gastric lymphomas survive five years after diag-nosis. Treatment for gastric lymphoma involves surgerycombined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\\nStaging of stomach cancer is based on how deep the\\ngrowth has penetrated the stomach lining; to what extent(if any) it has invaded surrounding lymph nodes; and towhat extent (if any) it has spread to distant parts of thebody (metastasized). The more confined the cancer, thebetter the chance for a cure.\\nOne important factor in the staging of adenocarcino-\\nma of the stomach is whether or not the tumor has invad-ed the surrounding tissue and, if it has, how deep it haspenetrated. If invasion is limited, prognosis is favorable.Disease tissue that is more localized improves the out-come of surgical procedures performed to remove thediseased area of the stomach. This is called a resection ofthe stomach.\\nSeveral distinct ways of classifying stomach cancer\\naccording to cell type have been proposed. The Laurenclassification is encountered most frequently. Accordingto this classification system, gastric adenocarcinomas areeither called intestinal or diffuse. Intestinal cancers aremuch like a type of intestinal cancer called intestinal car-cinoma. Intestinal tumors are more frequently found inmales and in older patients. The prognosis for thesetumors is better than that for diffuse tumors. Diffusetumors are more likely to infiltrate, that is, to move intoanother organ of the body.\\nBecause symptoms of stomach cancer are so mild,\\ntreatment often does not commence until the disease iswell advanced. The three standard modes of treatment forstomach cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, andchemotherapy. While deciding on the patient’s treatmentplan, the doctor takes into account many factors. Thelocation of the cancer and its stage are important consid-erations. In addition, the patient’s age, general health sta-tus, and personal preferences are also taken into account.\\nSurgery\\nIn the early stages of stomach cancer, surgery may\\nbe used to remove the cancer. Surgical removal of adeno-carcinoma is the only treatment capable of eliminatingthe disease. Laparoscopy is often used before surgery toinvestigate whether or not the tumor can be removed sur-gically. If the cancer is widespread and cannot beremoved with surgery, an attempt will be made to removeblockage and control symptoms such as pain or bleeding.Depending on the location of the cancer, a portion of the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3166Stomach cancerGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3166'),\n",

In a surgical procedure known as total gas-\\ntrectomy, the entire stomach may be removed. However,doctors prefer to leave at least part of the stomach if pos-sible. Patients who have been given a partial gastrectomyachieve a better quality of life than those having a totalgastrectomy and typically lead normal lives. Even whenthe entire stomach is removed, the patients quickly adjustto a different eating schedule. This involves eating smallquantities of food more frequently. High-protein foodsare generally recommended.\\nPartial or total gastrectomy is often accompanied by\\nother surgical procedures. Lymph nodes are frequentlyremoved and nearby organs, or parts of these organs,may be removed if cancer has spread to them. Suchorgans may include the pancreas, colon, or spleen.\\nPreliminary studies suggest that patients who have\\ntumors that cannot be removed by surgery at the start oftherapy may become candidates for surgery later. Combi-nations of chemotherapy and radiation therapy are some-times able to reduce disease for which surgery is not ini-tially appropriate. Preliminary studies are being per-formed to determine if some of these patients canbecome candidates for surgical procedures after suchtherapies are applied.\\nChemotherapy\\nWhether or not patients undergoing surgery for\\nstomach cancer should receive chemotherapy is a con-troversial issue. Chemotherapy involves administeringanti-cancer drugs either intravenously (through a vein inthe arm) or orally (in the form of pills). This can eitherbe used as the primary mode of treatment or aftersurgery to destroy any cancerous cells that may havemigrated to distant sites. Most cancers of the gastroin-testinal tract do not respond well to chemotherapy, how-ever, adenocarcinoma of the stomach and advancedstages of cancer are exceptions.\\nChemotherapy medicines such as doxorubicin, mit-\\nomycin C, and 5-fluorouracil, used alone, provide bene-fit to at least one in five patients. Combinations ofagents may provide even more benefit, although it is notcertain that this includes longer survival. For example,some doctors use what is called the FAM regimen,which combines 5-fluorouacil, doxorubicin, and mito-mycin. Some doctors prefer using 5-fluorouracil aloneto FAM since side effects are more moderate. Anothercombination some doctors are using involve high dosesof the medications methotrexate, 5- fluorouracil, anddoxorubicin. Other combinations that have shown bene-fit include the ELF regimen, a combination of leucov-orin, 5- fluorouracil, and etoposide. The EAP regimen,a combination of etoposide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin\\nis also used.\\nAlthough chemotherapy using a single medicine is\\nsometimes used, the best response rates are oftenachieved with combinations of medicines. Therefore,in addition to studies exploring the effectiveness ofnew medicines there are other studies attempting toevaluate how to best combine existing forms ofchemotherapy to bring the greatest degree of help topatients.\\nRadiation therapy\\nRadiation therapy is often used after surgery to\\ndestroy the cancer cells that may not have been com-pletely removed during surgery. To treat stomach cancer,external beam radiation therapy is generally used. In thisprocedure, high-energy rays from a machine that is out-side of the body are concentrated on the area of thetumor. In the advanced stages of gastric cancer, radiationtherapy is used to ease symptoms such as pain and bleed-ing. However, studies of radiation treatment for stomachcancer have shown that the way it has been used it hasbeen ineffective for many patients.\\nResearchers are actively assessing the role of\\nchemotherapy and radiation therapy used before a surgi-cal procedure is conducted. They are searching for waysto use both chemotherapy and radiation therapy so thatthey increase the length of survival of patients moreeffectively than current methods are able to do.\\nPrognosis\\nOverall, approximately 20% of patients with stom-\\nach cancer live at least five years following diagnosis.Patients diagnosed with stomach cancer in its earlystages have a far better prognosis than those for whom itis in the later stages. In the early stages, the tumor issmall, lymph nodes are unaffected, and the cancer hasnot migrated to the lungs or the liver. Unfortunately, onlyabout 20% of patients with stomach cancer are diagnosedbefore the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes orformed a distant metastasis.\\nIt is important to remember that statistics on prog-\\nnosis may be misleading. Newer therapies are beingdeveloped rapidly and five-year survival has not yetbeen measured with these. Also, the largest group ofpeople diagnosed with stomach cancer are between 60and 70 years of age, suggesting that some of thesepatients die not from cancer but from other age-relateddiseases. As a result, some patients with stomach cancermay be expected to have longer survival than didpatients just ten years ago.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3167Stomach cancerGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3167'),\n",

This procedure is calledstomach flushing or gastric lavage.\\nStomach flushing to control bleeding is not uniform-\\nly accepted, and some experts believe it is of little benefitand exposes the patient to unnecessary risks. It is usuallydone in conjunction with the administration of drugs toconstrict the blood vessels.\\nStomach flushing to remove poisons\\nAt one time, stomach flushing was common practice\\nto remove certain poisons. Recent thinking by the Ameri-can Academy of Clinical Toxicology is that stomach flush-ing should not be used routinely with poisoned patients. Itis useful only if the patient has swallowed a life-threaten-ing quantity of poison, and when the flushing can be donewithin 60 minutes of having swallowed the poison.\\nPrecautions\\nIn poisoning cases, stomach flushing should not be\\nused if the poison is a strong corrosive acid (hydrochloricacid, sulfuric acid), alkali (lye, ammonia), or a volatilehydrocarbon such as gasoline. Stomach flushing should alsonot be done on patients who are having convulsions.

Theword “stomatitis” literally means inflammation of themouth. The inflammation can be caused by conditions inthe mouth itself, such as poor oral hygiene , poorly fitted\\ndentures, or from mouth burns from hot food or drinks,\\nor by conditions that affect the entire body, such as med-ications, allergic reactions, or infections.\\nDescription\\nStomatitis is an inflammation of the lining of any of\\nthe soft-tissue structures of the mouth. Stomatitis is usu-ally a painful condition, associated with redness,swelling, and occasional bleeding from the affected area.Bad breath (halitosis) may also accompany the condi-\\ntion. Stomatitis affects all age groups, from the infant tothe elderly.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA number of factors can cause stomatitis. Poorly fit-\\nted oral appliances, cheek biting, or jagged teeth can per-sistently irritate the oral structures. Chronic mouthbreathing due to plugged nasal airways can cause dry-ness of the mouth tissues, which in turn leads to irrita-tion. Drinking beverages that are too hot can burn themouth, leading to irritation and pain . Diseases, such as\\nherpetic infections (the common cold sore), gonorrhea ,\\nmeasles , leukemia, AIDS , and lack of vitamin C can pre-\\nsent with oral signs. Aphthous stomatitis, also known as“canker sores,” is a specific type of stomatitis that pre-sents with shallow, painful ulcers that are usually locatedon the lips, cheeks, gums, or roof or floor of the mouth.These ulcers can range from pinpoint size to up to 1 in(2.5 cm) or more in diameter. Though the causes ofcanker sores is unknown, nutritional deficiencies, espe-\\ncially of vitamin B12, folate, or iron is suspected. Gener-\\nalized stomatitis can result from excessive use of alcohol,spices, hot food, or tobacco products. Sensitivity tomouthwashes, toothpastes, and lipstick can irritate thelining of the mouth. Exposure to heavy metals, such asmercury, lead, or bismuth can cause stomatitis. Thrush, afungal infection, is a type of stomatitis.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of stomatitis can be difficult. A patient’s\\nhistory may disclose a dietary deficiency, a systemic dis-ease, or contact with materials causing an allergic reac-tion. A physical examination is done to evaluate the oral\\nlesions and other skin problems. Blood tests may be doneto determine if any infection is present. Scrapings of thelining of the mouth may be sent to the laboratory formicroscopic evaluation, or cultures of the mouth may bedone to determine if an infectious agent may be the causeof the problem.\\nTreatment\\nThe treatment of stomatitis is based on the problem\\ncausing it. Local cleansing and good oral hygiene is fun-damental. Sharp-edged foods such as peanuts, tacos, andpotato chips should be avoided. A soft-bristled tooth-brush should be used, and the teeth and gums should bebrushed carefully; the patient should avoid banging thetoothbrush into the gums. Local factors, such as ill-fittingdental appliances or sharp teeth, can be corrected by adentist. An infectious cause can usually be treated withmedication. Systemic problems, such as AIDS, leukemia,and anemia are treated by the appropriate medical spe-cialist. Minor mouth burns from hot beverages or hotfoods will usually resolve on their own in a week or so.Chronic problems with aphthous stomatitis are treated byfirst correcting any vitamin B\\n12, iron, or folate deficien-\\ncies. If those therapies are unsuccessful, medication canbe prescribed which can be applied to each aphthousulcer with a cotton-tipped applicator. This therapy is suc-cessful with a limited number of patients.\\nAlternate treatment\\nAlternate treatment of stomatitis mainly involves\\nprevention of the problem. Patients with dental appli-ances such as dentures should visit their dentist on a reg-ular basis. Patients with systemic diseases or chronicmedical problems need to ask their health care providerwhat types of oral problems they can expect from theirparticular disease. These patients must also contact theirmedical clinic at the first sign of problems. Common\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3170StomatitisGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3170'),\n",

When secretions fromthe pancreas and liver are adequate, emulsified dietaryfats are almost completely absorbed in the small intestine.When a malabsorption disorder or other cause disruptsthis process, excretion of fat in the stool increases.\\nPurpose\\nThis test evaluates digestion of fats by determining\\nexcessive excretion of lipids in patients exhibiting signsof malabsorption, such as weight loss, abdominal disten-tion, and scaly skin.\\nPrecautions\\nDrugs that may increase fecal fat levels include ene-\\nmas and laxatives , especially mineral oil. Drugs that\\nmay decrease fecal fat include Metamucil and barium.Other substances that can affect test results include alco-hol, potassium chloride, calcium carbonate, neomycin,kanamycin, and other broad-spectrum antibiotics .\\nDescription\\nExcessive excretion of fecal fat is called steatorrhea,\\na condition that is suspected when the patient has large,“greasy,” and foul-smelling stools. Both digestive andabsorptive disorders can cause steatorrhea. Digestive dis-orders affect the production and release of the enzymelipase from the pancreas, or bile from the liver, which aresubstances that aid digestion of fats; absorptive disordersdisturb the absorptive and enzyme functions of the intes-tine. Any condition that causes malabsorption ormaldigestion is also associated with increased fecal fat.As an example, children with cystic fibrosis have\\nmucous plugs that block the pancreatic ducts. Theabsence or significant decrease of the pancreaticenzymes, amylase, lipase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin,limits fat protein and carbohydrate digestion, resulting insteatorrhea due to fat malabsorption.\\nBoth qualitative and quantitative tests are used to\\nidentify excessive fecal fat. The qualitative test involvesstaining a specimen of stool with a special dye, thenexamining it microscopically for evidence of malabsorp-tion, such as undigested muscle fiber and various fats.The quantitative test involves drying and weighing a 72-hour stool specimen, then using an extraction techniqueto separate the fats, which are subsequently evaporatedand weighed. This measurement of the total output offecal fat per 24 hours in a three-day specimen is the mostreliable test for steatorrhea.\\nPreparation\\nThis test requires a 72-hour stool collection. The\\npatient should abstain from alcohol during this time andmaintain a high-fat diet (100 g/day) for three days beforethe test, and during the collection period. The patientshould call the laboratory for instructions on how to col-lect the specimen.\\nNormal results\\nReference values vary from laboratory to laboratory,\\nbut are generally found within the range of 5–7 g/24 hr.\\nIt should be noted that children, especially infants,\\ncannot ingest the 100 g/day of fat that is suggested forthe test. Therefore, a fat retention coefficient is deter-mined by measuring the difference between ingested fatand fecal fat, and expressing that difference as a percent-age. The figure, called the fat retention coefficient, is95% or greater in healthy children and adults. A lowvalue is indicative of steatorrhea.\\nAbnormal results\\nIncreased fecal fat levels are found in cystic fibrosis,\\nmalabsorption secondary to other conditions like Whip-ple’s disease or Crohn’s disease , maldigestion sec-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3173Stool fat testGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3173'),\n",

Flores\\nStool O & P test\\nDefinition\\nThe stool O & P test is the stool ova and parasites\\ntest. In this test, a stool sample is examined for the pres-ence of intestinal parasites and their eggs, which arecalled ova.\\nPurpose\\nThe ova and parasites test is performed to look for\\nand identify intestinal parasites and their eggs in personswith symptoms of gastrointestinal infection. Patients mayhave no symptoms, or experience diarrhea , blood in the\\nstools, and other gastrointestinal distress. Identification ofa particular parasite indicates the cause of the patient’sdisease and determines the medication needed to treat it.\\nPrecautions\\nStool O & P is performed if an infection of the diges-\\ntive tract is suspected. The test has no harmful effects.\\nDescription\\nExamination of the stool for ova and parasites is\\ndone to diagnose parasitic infection of the intestines. Thetest may be done in the doctor’s office or a laboratory.The patient collects a stool sample in one or more sterilecontainers containing special chemical fixatives. Thefeces should be collected directly into the container. Itmust not be contaminated with urine, water, or othermaterials. Three specimens are often needed—collectedevery other day, or every third day. However, as many assix specimens may be needed to diagnose the amoebaEntamoeba histolytica . The specimen does not need to\\nbe refrigerated. It should be delivered to the doctor’soffice or laboratory within 12 hours.In the laboratory, the stool sample is observed for\\nsigns of parasites and their eggs. Some parasites are largeenough to be seen without a microscope. For others,microscope slides are prepared with fresh unstainedstool, and with stool dyed with special stains. Thesepreparations are observed with a microscope for the pres-ence of parasites or their eggs.\\nAn unstained stool examination for ova and para-\\nsites normally only takes a few minutes. If specimenstaining and other preparation is done, the test may takelonger. When the specimen is sent to a laboratory, theresults may take 8 to 24 hours to be reported.\\nThe most common intestinal parasites in North\\nAmerica that cause infections are:\\n• roundworms: Ascaris lumbricoides\\n• hookworms: Necator americanus\\n• pinworms: Enterobius follicularis\\n• tapeworms: Diphyllobothrium latum ,Taenia saginata ,\\nand Taenia solium\\n• protozoa: Entamoeba histolytica (an amoeba), and Gia-\\nrdia lamblia (a flagellate)\\nNumerous other parasites are found in other parts of\\nthe world. These may be contracted by travelers to othercountries. Patients with acquired immune deficiency syn-drome ( AIDS ) or other immune system disorders are com-\\nmonly infected with the parasites in the Microsporidia\\nfamily, Cryptosporidium , and Isospora belli .\\nInsurance coverage for stool ova and parasites may\\nvary among different insurance plans. This test usually iscovered if ordered by a physician approved by thepatient’s insurance plan, and if it is done at an approvedlaboratory.\\nPreparation\\nThe physician, or other healthcare provider, will ask\\nthe patient for a complete medical history, and perform aphysical examination to determine possible causes of\\nthe gastrointestinal symptoms. Information about thepatient’s diet, any medications taken, and recent travelmay provide clues to the identity of possible infectiousparasites.\\nCollecting a stool sample for ova and parasite\\ndetection normally doesn’t require any special prepara-tion. Patients do not need to change their diet beforecollecting the specimen. Patients should avoid takingany medications or treatments containing mineral oil,castor oil, or bismuth, magnesium or other antidiarrhealmedicines, or antibiotics for seven to 10 days before\\ncollecting the specimen.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3174Stool O & P testGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3174'),\n",

About\\nhalf are born with the condition, which causes one orboth eyes to turn:\\n• inward (esotropia or “crossed eyes”)\\n• outward (exotropia or “wall eyes”)\\n• upward (hypertropia)\\n• downward (hypotropia)\\nStrabismus is equally common in boys and girls. It\\nsometimes runs in families.\\nTypes of strabismus\\nEsotropia is the most common type of strabismus in\\ninfants. Accommodative esotropia develops in childrenunder age two who cross their eyes when focusing onobjects nearby. This usually occurs in children who aremoderately to highly farsighted (hyperopic).\\nAnother common form of strabismus, exotropia,\\nmay only be noticeable when a child looks at far-awayobjects, daydreams, or is tired or sick.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3175StrabismusGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3175'),\n",

Sometimes the tonsils arealso infected ( tonsillitis ). The disease is caused by groupA Streptococcus bacteria. Untreated strep throat may\\ndevelop into rheumatic fever or other serious conditions.\\nDescription\\nStrep throat accounts for between 5–10% of all sore\\nthroats. Although anyone can get strep throat, it is mostcommon in school-age children. People who smoke, whoare fatigued, run down, or who live in damp, crowdedconditions are also more likely to become infected. Chil-dren under age two and adults who are not around chil-dren are less likely to get the disease.\\nStrep throat occurs most frequently from November\\nto April. The disease passes directly from person to per-son by coughing, sneezing, and close contact. Very occa-sionally the disease is passed through food, when a foodhandler infected with strep throat accidentally contami-nates food by coughing or sneezing. Statistically, ifsomeone in the household is infected, one out of everyfour other household members may get strep throat with-in two to seven days.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA person with strep throat suddenly develops a\\npainful sore throat one to five days after being exposed tothe streptococcus bacteria. The pain is indistinguishable\\nfrom sore throats caused by other diseases.\\nThe infected person usually feels tired and has a\\nfever , sometimes accompanied by chills, headache ,\\nmuscle aches, swollen lymph glands, and nausea. Youngchildren may complain of abdominal pain. The tonsilslook swollen and are bright red, with white or yellowpatches of pus on them. Sometimes the roof of the mouthis red or has small red spots. Often a person with strepthroat has bad breath .\\nDespite these common symptoms, strep throat can\\nbe deceptive. It is possible to have the disease and notshow any of these symptoms. Many young children com-plain only of a headache and stomachache, without thecharacteristic sore throat.\\nOccasionally, within a few days of developing the\\nsore throat, an individual may develop a fine, rough, sun-burn-like rash over the face and upper body, and have afever of 101–104°F (38.3–40°C). The tongue becomesbright red, with a flecked, strawberry-like appearance.When a rash develops, this form of strep throat is calledscarlet fever . The rash is a reaction to toxins released by\\nthe streptococcus bacteria. Scarlet fever is no more dan-gerous than strep throat, and is treated the same way. Therash disappears in about five days. One to three weekslater, patches of skin may peel off, as might occur with asunburn , especially on the fingers and toes.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3177Strep throatGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3177'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 882}, page_content='Untreated strep throat can cause rheumatic fever.\\nThis is a serious illness, although it occurs rarely. Themost recent outbreak appeared in the United States in themid-1980s. Rheumatic fever occurs most often in chil-dren between the ages of five and 15, and may have agenetic component, since it seems to run in families.Although the strep throat that causes rheumatic fever iscontagious, rheumatic fever itself is not.\\nRheumatic fever begins one to six weeks after an\\nuntreated streptococcal infection. The joints, especiallythe wrists, elbows, knees, and ankles become red, sore,and swollen. The infected person develops a high fever,and possibly a rapid heartbeat when lying down, pale-ness, shortness of breath , and fluid retention. A red rash\\nover the trunk may come and go for weeks or months. Anacute attack of rheumatic fever lasts about three months.\\nRheumatic fever can cause permanent damage to the\\nheart and heart valves. It can be prevented by promptlytreating streptococcal infections with antibiotics . It\\ndoes not occur if all the streptococcus bacteria are killedwithin the first 10–12 days after infection.\\nIn the 1990s, outbreaks of a virulent strain of group\\nA Streptococcus were reported to cause a toxic-shock-\\nlike illness and a severe invasive infection called necro-tizing fasciitis, which destroys skin and muscle tissue.Although these diseases are caused by group A Strepto-\\ncocci , they rarely begin with strep throat. Usually the\\nstreptococcus bacteria enters the body through a skinwound. These complications are rare. However, since thedeath rate in necrotizing fasciitis is 30–50%, it is wise to\\nseek prompt treatment for any streptococcal infection.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of a strep throat by a doctor begins with a\\nphysical examination of the throat and chest. The doctor\\nwill also look for signs of other illness, such as a sinusinfection or bronchitis , and seek information about\\nwhether the patient has been around other people withstrep throat. If it appears that the patient may have strepthroat, the doctor will do laboratory tests.\\nThere are two types of tests to determine if a person\\nhas strep throat. A rapid strep test can only determine thepresence of streptococcal bacteria, but will not tell if thesore throat is caused by another kind of bacteria. Theresults are available in about 20 minutes. The advantage ofthis test is the speed with which a diagnosis can be made.\\nThe rapid strep test has a false negative rate of about\\n20%. In other words, in about 20% of cases where no strepis detected by the rapid strep test, the patient actually doeshave strep throat. Because of this, when a rapid strep test isnegative, the doctor often does a throat culture .\\nFor a rapid strep test or a throat culture, a nurse will\\nuse a sterile swab to reach down into the throat andobtain a sample of material from the sore area. The pro-cedure takes only a few seconds, but may cause gagging.\\nFor a throat culture a sample of swabbed material is\\ncultured, or grown, in the laboratory on a medium thatallows technicians to determine what kind of bacteriaare present. Results take 24–48 hours. The test is veryaccurate and will show the presence of other kinds ofbacteria besides Streptococci . It is important not to take\\nany leftover antibiotics before visiting the doctor andhaving a throat culture. Even small amounts of antibi-otics can suppress the bacteria and mask its presence inthe throat culture.\\nIn the event that rheumatic fever is suspected, the\\ndoctor does a blood test. This test, called an antistrep-tolysin-O test, will tell the doctor whether the person hasrecently been infected with strep bacteria. This helps thedoctor distinguish between rheumatic fever and rheuma-\\ntoid arthritis .\\nTreatment\\nStrep throat is treated with antibiotics. Penicillin is\\nthe preferred medication. Oral penicillin must be takenfor 10 days. Patients need to take the entire amount ofantibiotic prescribed and not discontinue taking the med-ication when they feel better. Stopping the antibioticearly can lead to a return of the strep infection.

When this happens a doctor mayprescribe other antibiotics such as amoxicillin (Amoxil,Pentamox, Sumox, Trimox), clindamycin (Cleocin), or acephalosporin (Keflex, Durocef, Ceclor). Erythromycin(Eryzole, Pediazole, Ilosone), another inexpensive antibi-otic, is given to people who are allergic to penicillin. Scar-let fever is treated with the same antibiotics as strep throat.\\nWithout treatment, the symptoms of strep throat\\nbegin subsiding in four or five days. However, because ofthe possibility of getting rheumatic fever, it is importantto treat strep throat promptly with antibiotics. If rheumat-ic fever does occur, it is also treated with antibiotics.Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as steroids, are used totreat joint swelling. Diuretics are used to reduce water\\nretention. Once the rheumatic fever becomes inactive,children may continue on low doses of antibiotics to pre-vent a reoccurrence. Necrotizing fasciitis is treated withintravenous antibiotics.\\nHome care for strep throat\\nThere are home care steps that people can take to\\nease the discomfort of their strep symptoms.\\n• Take acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain. Aspirin\\nshould not be given to children because of its associationwith an increase in Reye’s Syndrome , a serious disease.\\n• Gargle with warm double-strength tea or warm salt\\nwater, made by adding one teaspoon of salt to eightounces of water, to relieve sore throat pain.\\n• Drink plenty of fluids, but avoid acidic juices like\\norange juice because they irritate the throat.\\n• Eat soft, nutritious foods like noodle soup. Avoid spicy\\nfoods.\\n• Avoid smoke and smoking.\\n• Rest until the fever is gone, then resume strenuous\\nactivities gradually.\\n• Use a room humidifier, as it may make sore throat suf-\\nferers more comfortable.\\n• Be aware that antiseptic lozenges and sprays may\\naggravate the sore throat rather than improve it.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatment focuses on easing the symp-\\ntoms of strep throat through herbs and botanical medi-cines. Some practitioners suggest using these treatmentsin addition to antibiotics, since they primarily address thecomfort of the patient and not the underlying infection.Many practitioners recommend Lactobacillus aci-\\ndophilus to offset the suppressive effects of antibiotics on\\nthe beneficial bacteria of the intestines.\\nSome suggested treatments include:\\n• Inhaling fragrances of the essential oils of lavender\\n(Lavandula officinalis ), thyme ( Thymus vulgaris ),\\neucalyptus ( Eucalyptus globulus ), sage ( Salvia offici-\\nnalis ), and sandalwood (Aromatherapy).\\n• Gargling with a mixture of water, salt, and tumeric\\n(Curcuma longa ) powder or astringents, such as alum,\\nsumac, sage, and bayberry (Ayurvedic medicine).\\n• Taking osha root ( Ligusticum porteri ) internally for\\ninfection or drinking tea made of sage, echinacea (Echi-\\nnacea spp.) and cleavers ( Gallium aparine ). Osha root\\nhas an unpleasant taste many children will not accept(Botanical medicine).\\nPrognosis\\nPatients with strep throat begin feeling better about\\n24 hours after starting antibiotics. Symptoms rarely lastlonger than five days.\\nPeople remain contagious until after they have been\\ntaking antibiotics for 24 hours. Children should notreturn to school or childcare until they are no longer con-tagious. Food handlers should not work for the first 24hours after antibiotic treatment, because strep infectionsare occasionally passed through contaminated food. Peo-ple who are not treated with antibiotics can continue tospread strep bacteria for several months.\\nAbout 10% of strep throat cases do not respond to\\npenicillin. People who have even a mild sore throat aftera 10-day treatment with antibiotic should return to theirdoctor. An explanation for this may be that the person isjust a carrier of strep, and that something else is causingthe sore throat.\\nTaking antibiotics within the first week of a strep\\ninfection will prevent rheumatic fever and other compli-cations. If rheumatic fever does occur, the outcomes varyconsiderably. Some cases may be cured. In others theremay be permanent damage to the heart and heart valves.In rare cases, rheumatic fever can be fatal.\\nNecrotizing fasciitis has a death rate of 30–50%.\\nPatients who survive often suffer a great deal of tissueand muscle loss.

Identifi-\\ncation of infections of this type are particularly importantin suspected cases of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) or\\nacute glomerulonephritis.\\nStreptozyme is a screening test used to detect anti-\\nbodies to several streptococcal antigens. An antigen is asubstance that can trigger an immune response, resultingin production of an antibody as part of the body’s defenseagainst infection and disease.\\nPrecautions\\nFor the ASO test, increased levels of fats, called beta\\nlipoproteins, in the blood can neutralize streptolysin Oand cause a false-positive ASO titer. Antibiotics , which\\nreduce the number of streptococci and thereby suppressASO production, may decrease ASO levels. Steroids,which suppress the immune system, consequently mayalso suppress ASO production. Also Group A streptococ-cal infections of the skin may not produce an ASOresponse. Antibiotics also may decrease anti-DNase-B(ADB) levels.\\nDescription\\nStreptococcal infections are caused by bacteria\\nknown as Streptococcus . There are several disease-caus-\\ning strains of streptococci (groups A, B, C, D, and G),which are identified by their behavior, chemistry, andappearance. Each group causes specific types of infec-tions and symptoms. These antibody tests are useful forgroup A streptococci. Group A streptococci are the mostvirulent species for humans and are the cause of strep\\nthroat ,tonsillitis , wound and skin infections, blood\\ninfections (septicemia), scarlet fever, pneumonia ,\\nrheumatic fever, Sydenham’s chorea (formerly called\\nSt. Vitus’ dance), and glomerulonephritis.\\nAlthough symptoms may suggest a streptococcal\\ninfection, the diagnosis must be confirmed by tests. Thebest procedure, and one that is used for an acute infec-tion, is to take a sample from the infected area for cul-ture, a means of growing bacteria artificially in the labo-ratory. However, cultures are useless about two to threeweeks after initial infection, so the ASO, anti-DNase-B,and streptozyme tests are used to determine if a strepto-coccal infection is present.\\nAntistreptolysin O titer (ASO)\\nThe ASO titer is used to demonstrate the body’s\\nreaction to an infection caused by group A beta-hemolyt-ic streptococci.

Because streptolysin O is antigenic (containsa protein foreign to the body), the body reacts by produc-ing antistreptolysin O (ASO), which is a neutralizingantibody. ASO appears in the blood serum one week toone month after the onset of a strep infection. A high titer(high levels of ASO) is not specific for any type of post-streptococcal disease, but it does indicate if a streptococ-cal infection is or has been present.\\nSerial (several given in a row) ASO testing is often\\nperformed to determine the difference between an acuteor convalescent blood sample. The diagnosis of a previ-ous strep infection is confirmed when serial titers of ASOrise over a period of weeks, then fall slowly. ASO titerspeak during the third week after the onset of acute symp-toms of a streptococcal disease; at six months after onset,approximately 30% of patients exhibit abnormal titers.\\nAntideoxyribonuclease-B titer (anti-DNase B, or\\nADB)\\nAnti-DNase-B, or ADB, also detects antigens pro-\\nduced by group A strep, and is elevated in most patientswith rheumatic fever and poststreptococcal glomeru-lonephritis.

When stress wasfirst studied in the 1950s, the term was used to denoteboth the causes and the experienced effects of these pres-sures. More recently, however, the word stressor hasbeen used for the stimulus that provokes a stressresponse. One recurrent disagreement among researchersconcerns the definition of stress in humans. Is it primari-ly an external response that can be measured by changesin glandular secretions, skin reactions, and other physicalfunctions, or is it an internal interpretation of, or reactionto, a stressor; or is it both?\\nDescription\\nStress in humans results from interactions between\\npersons and their environment that are perceived asstraining or exceeding their adaptive capacities andthreatening their well- being. The element of perceptionindicates that human stress responses reflect differencesin personality, as well as differences in physical strengthor general health.\\nRisk factors for stress-related illnesses are a mix of\\npersonal, interpersonal, and social variables. These fac-tors include lack or loss of control over one’s physicalenvironment, and lack or loss of social support net-works. People who are dependent on others (e.g., chil-dren or the elderly) or who are socially disadvantaged(because of race, gender, educational level, or similarfactors) are at greater risk of developing stress-relatedillnesses. Other risk factors include feelings of helpless-ness, hopelessness, extreme fear or anger, and cynicismor distrust of others.Causes and symptoms\\nThe causes of stress can include any event or occur-\\nrence that a person considers a threat to his or her copingstrategies or resources. Researchers generally agree thata certain degree of stress is a normal part of a livingorganism’s response to the inevitable changes in its phys-ical or social environment, and that positive, as well asnegative, events can generate stress as well as negativeoccurrences. Stress-related disease, however, resultsfrom excessive and prolonged demands on an organism’scoping resources.\\nThe symptoms of stress can be either physical and\\npsychological. Stress-related physical illnesses, such asirritable bowel syndrome , heart attacks, and chronic\\nheadaches, result from long-term overstimulation of apart of the nervous system that regulates the heart rate,blood pressure, and digestive system. Stress-related emo-tional illness results from inadequate or inappropriateresponses to major changes in one’s life situation, such asmarriage, completing one’s education, becoming a parent,losing a job, or retirement. Psychiatrists sometimes usethe term adjustment disorder to describe this type of ill-ness. In the workplace, stress-related illness often takesthe form of burnout—a loss of interest in or ability to per-form one’s job due to long-term high stress levels.\\nDiagnosis\\nWhen the doctor suspects that a patient’s illness is\\nconnected to stress, he or she will take a careful historythat includes stressors in the patient’s life (family oremployment problems, other illnesses, etc.). Manyphysicians will evaluate the patient’s personality as well,in order to assess his or her coping resources and emo-tional response patterns. There are a number of personal-ity inventories and psychological tests that doctors can\\nuse to help diagnose the amount of stress that the patientexperiences and the coping strategies that he or she usesto deal with them. Stress-related illness can be diagnosedby primary care doctors, as well as by those who special-ize in psychiatry. The doctor will need to distinguishbetween adjustment disorders and anxiety or mood\\ndisorders , and between psychiatric disorders and physi-\\ncal illnesses (e.g., thyroid activity) that have psychologi-cal side effects.\\nTreatment\\nRecent advances in the understanding of the many\\ncomplex connections between the human mind and bodyhave produced a variety of mainstream approaches tostress-related illness.

Stress reduction refers to various strategies thatcounteract this response and produce a sense of relax-ation and tranquility\\nPurpose\\nAlthough stress is a natural phenomenon of living,\\nstress that is not controlled and that continues for a longperiod of time can seriously compromise health. For thisreason, stress must be understood, managed and appro-priately reduced. Several very different strategies andtherapies are available that help with relaxation andstress management.\\nPrecautions\\nStress reduction can only present a problem if an\\nindividual attributes an actual, serious condition or dis-ease to being simply a stress-related response and avoidsconsulting a physician.Description\\nEveryone encounters stress every day. Although\\nmost people think of it as something negative that hap-pens to them, in fact stress itself is really neither goodnor bad but is neutral or nonspecific. Stress may be inter-nal (from within ourselves) or external (such as noisefrom the environment) and does not always result fromsomething unpleasant. A certain amount of stress in ourlives is actually essential to being sufficiently stimulatedto meet the challenges of everyday life, but when stress isconstant and acute, it can have dangerous consequences.Since stress is both natural and unavoidable, it is neces-sary to understand it and to learn how to deal with it, par-ticularly how to reduce it.\\nThe specific and immediate cause of stress is called\\nthe stressor. A stressor can be something dramatic or ter-rible, such as a violent experience or the death of a loved\\none, or it can be a positive and rewarding event, like mar-riage or a promotion. The stressor can be internal, suchas feelings of guilt or anger felt in a relationship, or it canbe external, such as a natural disaster or the ordinary rig-ors and frustrations of commuting. It can also have aphysical source, like simple exercise or hard work, or it\\ncan be strictly mental, like worry. Our bodies react thesame way physiologically no matter what the source andreasons for stress might be.\\nFrom a physical standpoint, the body reacts to stress\\nin a standard and predictable manner. When stressoccurs, the brain immediately receives nerve impulses.These impulses initiate an automatic sequence carriedout by the body’s sympathetic nervous system: it beginswith stimulation of the brain’s hypothalamus, whichsends nerve impulses to both the adrenal and the pituitaryglands. Also called the “fight or flight” response, thisautomatic physiological process is known to haveevolved in humans and animals to enable them to copewith sudden life-threatening emergencies. When facedwith a major stressor, the body’s biochemistry instantlyhurtles into a ready mode that marshals all the possibleresources necessary to either escape or do battle. Thus,the adrenal glands located on top of the kidneys providean instant surge of adrenaline, the body’s rocket fuel,quickening the heart rate and blood flow and providingevery cell with extra oxygen. They also release cortisolor hydrocortisone, causing an increase in both aminoacids (the building blocks of proteins) and blood sugar.These will be needed if tissue repair must take place.Finally, the pituitary gland at the base of the brain releas-es a variety of hormones, endorphins among them, thatact as natural painkillers and permit the body to do thingsit ordinarily cannot do. Thus, at just about the same timea stressor is recognized by the body, the heart and breath-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3187Stress reductionGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3187'),\n",

This\\nsequence of events allows individuals to do whatever isrequired to save themselves, whether it is to flee from apredator or engage in combat and fend off an attack.\\nWhile these automatic physiological responses\\nserved early man well and were essential to survival ofthe species, today’s men and women rarely must literallyfight for their lives or dodge and elude a predator. Yettheir bodies’ automatic response to stress has remainedunchanged in a radically changed, modern world.Whether caveman or corporate executive, when the fight-or-flight response kicks in, a three-stage process begins.Stage one is the alarm stage in which the body releaseshormones and prepares for extreme physical action.Resistance is stage two in which the body attempts toresist yet adapt to the stress and to repair any damagedone. The final stage, exhaustion, occurs if the stressremains constant. It is especially dangerous since stageone’s physical response may begin all over again. Thepersistence of stress and stage three’s exhaustion is thepoint at which disease can occur. The body may thenexperience severe debilitating conditions like migraine,heart irregularities, and mental illness. The body’s func-tions may even shut down altogether.\\nAlthough different individuals may have different\\nlevels of tolerance to stress, chronic stress will eventuallywear down even the strongest of people. Prolonged stresscan cause biochemical imbalances that weaken theimmune system and invite serious illness. Overall, stressthat persists is known to interfere with digestion and,more seriously, alter brain chemistry, create hormonalimbalances, increase heart rate, raise blood pressure, andnegatively affect both metabolic and immune function. Itis also important to recognize that although stress itself isnot a disease, it can worsen any number of already seri-ous physical conditions. Many physicians feel thatchronic stress can so overtax an individual’s physicalresources and ways of coping that cancer ,stroke , and\\nheart disease can occur. While long-term stress can seri-ously affect one’s quality of life and lead to major, some-times fatal, diseases, prolonged stress also results in theeveryday miseries of headache and allergy, digestive\\ndisorders and fatigue , irritable bladder and impotence ,\\ninsomnia ,anxiety , depression, and simple aches and\\npains. Researchers exploring the connection betweenstress and susceptibility to colds exposed stressed indi-viduals (who had experienced a death in the family,become divorced, or had recently moved) to cold virusesand then tested for antibodies a month later. Results indi-cated that severely stressed individuals were four timesmore likely to become infected.It follows that if stress can cause or contribute to ill-\\nness, then reducing stress should have the opposite effectand perhaps even encourage healing. Probably the mostimportant step toward reducing the stress in everyone’slife is to understand the nature of stress and to learn howto condition ourselves to be able to gain some controlover it. Being able to recognize that we are stressed isprobably the first step toward understanding. Of themany signs and symptoms that alert us, some are obviousand require only common sense to recognize. Short-termnoticeable effects of stress include sweaty palms andother types of perspiration, dilated pupils, and difficultyin swallowing (“a lump in the throat”). Tightness in thechest is another stress signal as are stomach problemsand some skin conditions. Stress that is the result of pro-longed anxiety (a sense of apprehension) often results infeelings of panic or actual trembling, fatigue, insomnia,and shortness of breath , heart palpitations and dizzi-\\nness, and sometimes simple irritability. Although none of\\nthese symptoms is pleasant, they are relatively minorcompared to the silent but much more serious internaleffects that can lead to immune-related disorders andeven cancer and heart disease.\\nFortunately, stress and the negative effects it creates\\ncan be reduced by a wide variety of therapeuticapproaches. When successfully applied, many of thesetherapies or strategies can both reduce stress and reverseits damage. Before selecting a particular therapy, it isimportant to be able distinguish bad or unhealthy stressfrom the type that is not bad. Researchers have found thatthe most important variable among types of stress is anindividual’s sense of control in a given situation. Theleast harmful stress scenario is one in which an individ-ual has a sufficient degree of control or some idea of pre-dictability. Put simply, predictable pain is less stressfulbecause individuals know when to relax (gaining relieffrom pain as well as protecting themselves from its dam-aging effects). But when individuals have no warning ofpain, they are in a state of constant stress. An examplefrom daily life might be the difference between the stressexperienced by top executives who are in control of theirfate and their middle-level managers who are not. Theformer can pick and choose when to enter or engage astressful situation or problem, but the latter have no con-trol nor any ability to predict when such a situation willarise and are constantly on alert or in a state of anxiety.\\nFor those with little control over situations that make\\nthem anxious, there are basically two ways to deal withtheir stress. One is to remove or at least reduce the stres-sor, and the other is to increase their resistance to it.Although there are many strategies to achieve each ofthese, all of them can be reduced to some variation of asingle, simple concept - relaxation.

Although relaxation is at the core ofmost stress reduction methods, it is not something thateveryone can fully achieve without assistance and guid-ance. Interestingly, our modern life experiences often donot provide us with the coping skills needed to deal withstressful stimuli, and increasingly, people find that sim-ple relaxing is something that they must learn how to do.\\nFortunately, there are a number of relaxation therapies\\nthat enable the willing individual to achieve deep, benefi-cial relaxation. In fact, there are almost too many fromwhich to choose. A 1997 book on stress remedies cowrittenby the editors of Prevention magazine and published by\\nRodale Press is organized alphabetically and lists fifty-nineseparate stress-reducing techniques and subjects, fromAcceptance to Yoga . These and many other methods of\\nreducing stress can be grouped into the following generalcategories: mind-body therapies, body work and movementtherapies, and herbal-based diets and natural regimens.\\nMany of the specific techniques in these categories can bepart of a self-help or self-care approach, although somerequire the help of an experienced practitioner.\\nTherapies that focus on the mind/body connection\\nare based on the fact that thinking and emotions can havephysical effects on the body. These techniques encouragethe individual to take control and learning how to copewith stressors rather than trying to eliminate them. Suchtherapies range from individual counseling and medita-\\ntion or involvement with a support group to the mystery\\nof guided imagery and the technology of biofeedback .\\nThey all have the common goal of evoking the physio-logical relaxation response, in which a person canachieve such beneficial internal results as lowering bloodpressure and decreasing gastric acid secretion.\\nBody work and movement therapies include tech-\\nniques ranging from dance therapy and the gentleness ofmassage to reflexology and the rigors of rolfing . Body\\nwork is based partly on the therapeutic power of humantouch and can also include manipulation, realignment, andposture correction. Movement therapies are a particularform of physical exercise, although they attempt to domuch more than simply get a person into shape. Most usu-ally emphasize the mind/body connection and strive to putpeople in better touch with both their bodies and their feel-ings. Body work and movement therapies can be as vigor-ous as deep tissue manipulation or as simple and minimalas the Alexander technique’s light posture corrections.\\nHerbal remedies for stress are usually part of a larger\\nsystem of natural, holistic medicine . Whether Chinesetraditional medicine, its counterpart from India, or the\\nhomeopathy of the West, all these systems of natural\\nmedicine have a holistic focus and emphasize the needfor inner balance. All demonstrate how the individual’sphysical, emotional, mental, and spiritual states are con-nected and use natural substances as part of the treatmentfor reducing stress. Such therapies range from the occa-sional purging (cleansing) of Ayurvedic medicine to the\\nsleep-inducing properties of chamomile tea. They alsocan include the use of cayenne to relieve pain, fragrantessential oils from flowers to evoke a pleasing responseand relieve tension, or aloe vera to soothe burned skin.\\nA list of some of the more common therapies and\\ntechniques available for reducing stress includes:\\n• Acupuncture. Insertion of needles at certain spots under\\nthe skin for the purpose of attaining balance by eitherreleasing blocked energy or draining off excess energy.\\n• Alexander technique. Improving the alignment of head,\\nneck, and back claims to achieve efficient posture andmovement.\\n• Aromatherapy.

Because of the increased stress on theheart, exercise can reveal coronary problems that are notapparent when the body is at rest. This is why the stresstest, though not perfect, remains the best initial, noninva-sive, practical coronary test.\\nThe stress test helps doctors determine how well the\\nheart handles the increased demands imposed by physi-cal activity. It is particularly useful for evaluating possi-ble coronary artery disease , detecting inadequate sup-\\nply of oxygen-rich blood to the tissues of the heart mus-cle (ischemia ), and determining safe levels of exercise in\\npeople with existing heart disease.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3191Stress testGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3191'),\n",

For this reason, the\\nexercise stress test should be attended by a health careprofessional with a defibrillator and other emergencyequipment on standby.\\nThe patient must be aware of the symptoms of a\\nheart attack and stop the test if he or she develops any ofthe following symptoms:\\n• an unsteady gait\\n• confusion\\n• skin is grayish or cold and clammy•dizziness or fainting\\n• a drop in blood pressure\\n• chest pain (angina )\\n• irregular heart beat (cardiac arrhythmias)\\nDescription\\nThe technician affixes electrodes to specific areas of\\nthe patient’s chest, using special adhesive patches with aspecial gel that conducts electrical impulses. Typically,electrodes are placed under each collarbone and eachbottom rib, and six electrodes are placed across the chestin a rough outline of the heart. Then the technicianattaches wires from the electrodes to an ECG, whichrecords the electrical activity picked up by the electrodes.\\nThe technician runs resting ECG tests while the\\npatient is lying down, then standing up, and then breath-ing heavily for half a minute. These tests can later becompared with the ECG tests performed while the patientis exercising. The patient’s blood pressure is taken and theblood pressure cuff is left in place, so that blood pressurecan be measured periodically throughout the test.\\nThe patient begins riding a stationary bicycle or\\nwalking on a treadmill. Gradually the intensity of theexercise is increased. For example, if the patient is walk-ing on a treadmill, the speed of the treadmill increasesand the treadmill is tilted upward to simulate an incline.If the patient is on an exercise bicycle, the resistance or“drag” is gradually increased. The patient continuesexercising at increasing intensity until he or she reacheshis or her target heart rate (generally set at a minimum of85% of the maximal predicted heart rate based on thepatient’s age) or experiences severe fatigue , dizziness, or\\nchest pain. During this time, the patient’s heart rate, ECGpattern, and blood pressure are continually monitored.\\nIn some cases, other tests, such as echocardiography\\nor thallium scanning, are also used in conjunction with theexercise stress test. For instance, recent studies suggestthat women have a high rate of false negatives (resultsshowing no problem when one exists) and false positives\\n(results showing a problem when one does not exist) withthe stress test. They may benefit from another test, such asexercise echocardiography. People who are unable to exer-cise may be injected with drugs that mimic the effects ofexercise on the heart and given a thallium scan, which candetect the same abnormalities that an exercise test can.\\nPreparation\\nPatients are usually instructed not to eat or smoke\\nfor several hours before the test. They should also tell thedoctor about any medications they are taking. Theyshould wear comfortable sneakers and exercise clothing.\\nAftercare\\nAfter the test, the patient should rest until blood\\npressure and heart rate return to normal. If all goes well,and there are no signs of distress, the patient may returnto his or her normal daily activities.\\nRisks\\nThere is a very slight risk of a heart attack from the\\nexercise, as well as cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeats), angina, or cardiac arrest (about one in 100,000).\\nNormal results\\nA normal result of an exercise stress test shows nor-\\nmal electrocardiogram tracings and heart rate, bloodpressure within the normal range, and no angina, unusualdizziness, or shortness of breath .\\nAbnormal results\\nA number of abnormalities may show up on an exer-\\ncise stress test. An abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG)may indicate deprivation of oxygen-rich blood to the heartmuscle (ST wave segment depression, for example), heartrhythm disturbances, or structural abnormalities of theheart, such as overgrowth of muscle (hypertrophy). If theblood pressure rises too high or the patient experiencesdistressing symptoms during the test, the heart may beunable to handle the increased workload.

Without blood to supply oxygen andnutrients and to remove waste products, brain cellsquickly begin to die. Depending on the region of thebrain affected, a stroke may cause paralysis , speech\\nimpairment, loss of memory and reasoning ability, coma ,\\nor death. A stroke is also sometimes called a brain attackor a cerebrovascular accident (CV A).\\nSome important stroke statistics:\\n• more than half a million people in the United States\\nexperience a new or recurrent stroke each year\\n• stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United\\nStates and the leading cause of disability\\n• stroke kills about 150,000 Americans each year, or\\nalmost one out of three stroke victims\\n• three million Americans are currently permanently dis-\\nabled from stroke\\n• in the United States, stroke costs about $30 billion per\\nyear in direct costs and loss of productivity\\n• two-thirds of strokes occur in people over age 65• strokes affect men more often than women, although\\nwomen are more likely to die from a stroke\\n• strokes affect blacks more often than whites, and are\\nmore likely to be fatal among blacks\\nStroke is a medical emergency requiring immediate\\ntreatment. Prompt treatment improves the chances of sur-vival and increases the degree of recovery that may beexpected. A person who may have suffered a strokeshould be seen in a hospital emergency room withoutdelay. Treatment to break up a blood clot, the majorcause of stroke, must begin within three hours of thestroke to be effective. Improved medical treatment of alltypes of stroke has resulted in a dramatic decline in deathrates in recent decades. In 1950, nine in ten died fromstroke, compared to slightly less than one in three today.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThere are four main types of stroke. Cerebral throm-\\nbosis and cerebral embolism are caused by blood clots\\nthat block an artery supplying the brain, either in thebrain itself or in the neck. These account for 70–80% ofall strokes. Subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracere-\\nbral hemorrhage occur when a blood vessel burstsaround or in the brain.\\nCerebral thrombosis occurs when a blood clot, or\\nthrombus, forms within the brain itself, blocking the flow\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3194StrokeGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3194'),\n",

Clots most often\\nform due to “hardening” ( atherosclerosis ) of brain arter-\\nies. Cerebral thrombosis occurs most often at night orearly in the morning. Cerebral thrombosis is often pre-ceded by a transient ischemic attack , or TIA, some-\\ntimes called a “mini-stroke.” In a TIA, blood flow is tem-porarily interrupted, causing short-lived stroke-likesymptoms. Recognizing the occurrence of a TIA, andseeking immediate treatment, is an important step instroke prevention.\\nCerebral embolism occurs when a blood clot from\\nelsewhere in the circulatory system breaks free. If itbecomes lodged in an artery supplying the brain, eitherin the brain or in the neck, it can cause a stroke. The mostcommon cause of cerebral embolism is atrial fibrillation,a disorder of the heart beat. In atrial fibrillation, theupper chambers (atria) of the heart beat weakly andrapidly, instead of slowly and steadily. Blood within theatria is not completely emptied. This stagnant blood mayform clots within the atria, which can then break off andenter the circulation. Atrial fibrillation is a factor in about15% of all strokes. The risk of a stroke from atrial fibril-lation can be dramatically reduced with daily use of anti-coagulant medication.\\nHemorrhage, or bleeding, occurs when a blood ves-\\nsel breaks, either from trauma or excess internal pres-sure. The vessels most likely to break are those with pre-existing defects such as an aneurysm. An aneurysm is a“pouching out” of a blood vessel caused by a weak arter-ial wall. Brain aneurysms are surprisingly common.According to autopsy studies, about 6% of all Ameri-\\ncans have them. Aneurysms rarely cause symptoms untilthey burst. Aneurysms are most likely to burst whenblood pressure is highest, and controlling blood pressureis an important preventive strategy.\\nIntracerebral hemorrhage affects vessels within the\\nbrain itself, while subarachnoid hemorrhage affects arter-ies at the brain’s surface, just below the protective arach-noid membrane. Intracerebral hemorrhages representabout 10% of all strokes, while subarachnoid hemor-rhages account for about 7%.\\nIn addition to depriving affected tissues of blood\\nsupply, the accumulation of fluid within the inflexibleskull creates excess pressure on brain tissue, which canquickly become fatal. Nonetheless, recovery may bemore complete for a person who survives hemorrhagethan for one who survives a clot, because the blooddeprivation effects are usually not as severe.\\nDeath of brain cells triggers a chain reaction in\\nwhich toxic chemicals created by cell death affect othernearby cells. This is one reason why prompt treatmentcan have such a dramatic effect on final recovery.Risk factors\\nRisk factors for stroke involve age, sex, heredity,\\npredisposing diseases or other medical conditions, andlifestyle choices:\\n• Age and sex. The risk of stroke increases with increas-\\ning age, doubling for each decade after age 55. Men aremore likely to have a stroke than women.\\n• Heredity. Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics all have higher\\nrates of stroke than do whites, related partly to higherblood pressure. People with a family history of strokeare at greater risk.\\n• Diseases. Stroke risk is increased for people with dia-\\nbetes, heart disease (especially atrial fibrillation), highblood pressure, prior stroke, or TIA. Risk of strokeincreases tenfold for someone with one or more TIAs.\\n• Other medical conditions. Stroke risk increases with\\nobesity , high blood cholesterol level, or high red blood\\ncell count.\\n• Lifestyle choices. Stroke risk increases with cigarette\\nsmoking (especially if combined with the use of oral\\ncontraceptives ), low level of physical activity, alcohol\\nconsumption above two drinks per day, or use ofcocaine or intravenous drugs.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms of an embolic stroke usually come on\\nquite suddenly and are at their most intense right fromthe start, while symptoms of a thrombotic stroke comeon more gradually. Symptoms may include:\\n• blurring or decreased vision in one or both eyes• severe headache , often described as “the worst head-\\nache of my life”\\n• weakness, numbness, or paralysis of the face, arm, or\\nleg, usually confined to one side of the body\\n• dizziness, loss of balance or coordination, especially\\nwhen combined with other symptoms\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of stroke is begun with a careful med-\\nical history, especially concerning the onset and distribu-tion of symptoms, presence of risk factors, and the exclu-sion of other possible causes. A brief neurological exam isperformed to identify the degree and location of anydeficits, such as weakness, incoordination, or visual losses.\\nOnce stroke is suspected, a computed tomography\\nscan (CT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\\nscan is performed to distinguish a stroke caused by bloodclot from one caused by hemorrhage, a critical distinc-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3195StrokeGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3195'),\n",

This “thrombolytic therapy”is currently performed most often with tissue plasmino-gen activator, or t-PA. t-PA must be administered withinthree hours of the stroke event. Therefore, patients whoawaken with stroke symptoms are ineligible for t-PA ther-apy, as the time of onset cannot be accurately determined.t-PA therapy has been shown to improve recovery and\\ndecrease long-term disability in selected patients. t-PAtherapy carries a 6.4% risk of inducing a cerebral hemor-rhage, and is not appropriate for patients with bleedingdisorders, very high blood pressure, known aneurysms,any evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, or incidence ofstroke, head trauma, or intracranial surgery within thepast three months. Patients with clot-related (thromboticor embolic) stroke who are ineligible for t-PA treatmentmay be treated with heparin or other blood thinners, orwith aspirin or other anti-clotting agents in some cases.\\nEmergency treatment of hemorrhagic stroke is\\naimed at controlling intracranial pressure.

Ruptured vessels are closed offto prevent rebleeding. For aneurysms that are difficult toreach surgically, endovascular treatment may be used. Inthis procedure, a catheter is guided from a larger arteryup into the brain to reach the aneurysm. Small coils ofwire are discharged into the aneurysm, which plug it upand block off blood flow from the main artery.\\nRehabilitation\\nRehabilitation refers to a comprehensive program\\ndesigned to regain function as much as possible and com-pensate for permanent losses. Approximately 10% ofstroke survivors are without any significant disability andable to function independently. Another 10% are so severe-ly affected that they must remain institutionalized forsevere disability. The remaining 80% can return home withappropriate therapy, training, support, and care services.\\nRehabilitation is coordinated by a team of medical\\nprofessionals and may include the services of a neurolo-gist, a physician who specializes in rehabilitation medi-cine (physiatrist), a physical therapist, an occupationaltherapist, a speech-language pathologist, a nutritionist, amental health professional, and a social worker. Rehabil-itation services may be provided in an acute care hospi-tal, rehabilitation hospital, long-term care facility, outpa-tient clinic, or at home.\\nThe rehabilitation program is based on the patient’s\\nindividual deficits and strengths. Strokes on the left sideof the brain primarily affect the right half of the body,and vice versa. In addition, in left brain dominant people,who constitute a significant majority of the population,left brain strokes usually lead to speech and languagedeficits, while right brain strokes may affect spatial per-ception. Patients with right brain strokes may also denytheir illness, neglect the affected side of their body, andbehave impulsively.\\nRehabilitation may be complicated by cognitive\\nlosses, including diminished ability to understand andfollow directions. Poor results are more likely in patientswith significant or prolonged cognitive changes, sensorylosses, language deficits, or incontinence.\\nPREVENTING COMPLICATIONS. Rehabilitation begins\\nwith prevention of stroke recurrence and other medicalcomplications. The risk of stroke recurrence may bereduced with many of the same measures used to preventstroke, including quitting smoking and controlling bloodpressure.One of the most common medical complications fol-\\nlowing stroke is deep venous thrombosis, in which a clotforms within a limb immobilized by paralysis. Clots thatbreak free often become lodged in an artery feeding thelungs. This type of pulmonary embolism is a common\\ncause of death in the weeks following a stroke. Resumingactivity within a day or two after the stroke is an impor-tant preventive measure, along with use of elastic stock-ings on the lower limbs. Drugs that prevent clotting maybe given, including intravenous heparin and oral warfarin.\\nWeakness and loss of coordination of the swallow-\\ning muscles may impair swallowing (dysphagia), andallow food to enter the lower airway. This may lead toaspiration pneumonia , another common cause of death\\nshortly after a stroke. Dysphagia may be treated withretraining exercises and temporary use of pureed foods.\\nDepression occurs in 30–60% of stroke patients.\\nAntidepressants and psychotherapy may be used in com-bination.\\nOther medical complications include urinary tract\\ninfections, pressure ulcers, falls, and seizures.\\nTYPES OF REHABILITATIVE THERAPY. Brain tissue\\nthat dies in a stroke cannot regenerate. In some cases, thefunctions of that tissue may be performed by other brainregions after a training period. In other cases, compen-satory actions may be developed to replace lost abilities.\\nPhysical therapy is used to maintain and restore\\nrange of motion and strength in affected limbs, and tomaximize mobility in walking, wheelchair use, andtransferring (from wheelchair to toilet or from standingto sitting, for instance). The physical therapist advises onmobility aids such as wheelchairs, braces, and canes. Inthe recovery period, a stroke patient may develop musclespasticity and contractures , or abnormal contractions.\\nContractures may be treated with a combination ofstretching and splinting.\\nOccupational therapy improves self-care skills such\\nas feeding, bathing, and dressing, and helps developeffective compensatory strategies and devices for activi-ties of daily living. A speech-language pathologist focus-es on communication and swallowing skills. When dys-phagia is a problem, a nutritionist can advise alternativemeals that provide adequate nutrition .\\nMental health professionals may be involved in the\\ntreatment of depression or loss of thinking (cognitive)skills. A social worker may help coordinate services andease the transition out of the hospital back into the home.Both social workers and mental health professionals mayhelp counsel the patient and family during the difficultrehabilitation period.

Stutterers are different than people experiencingnormal fluency problems because a stutterer’s disfluencyis more severe and consistent than that of people who donot stutter.\\nDescription\\nNormal language development in a child can include\\na period of disfluency. Children might repeat syllables orwords once or twice. Sometimes, children experiencingnormal disfluencies hesitate during speech or use fillers,including “um,” with frequency. These developmentalproblems usually happen between one and five years ofage. Often, parents are concerned about the disfluencythey hear in their children. In fact, about 25% of all chil-dren experience speech disfluencies during developmentconcern their parents because of their severity.\\nA child with mild stuttering, however, will repeat\\nsounds more than twice. Parents and teachers oftennotice the child’s facial muscles become tense and he orshe might struggle to speak. The child’s voice pitchmight rise with repetitions, and some children experi-ence occasional periods when airflow or voice stops forseconds at a time. Children with more severe stutteringstutter through more than 10% of their speech. Thischild exhibits considerable tension and tries to avoidstuttering by using different words. In these children,complete blocks of speech are more common than repe-titions or prolongations, during which children lengthensyllables or words.\\nStuttering usually begins in childhood when the\\nchild is developing language skills, and it rarely developsin adulthood with only 1% of the population affected bythe disorder. Stuttering does not affect intelligence. Teensoften experience more noticeable problems with stutter-ing as they enter the dating scene and increase theirsocial interactions. Stuttering can severely affect one’slife. Often, adults who are concerned about stutteringchoose their careers based on the disability.\\nThe degree of stuttering is often inconsistent. Stut-\\nterers can be fluent in some situations. Many find thatthey stop stuttering when singing or doing other activi-ties involving speech. Some have good and bad dayswhen it comes to stuttering. On good days, a stutterermight be able to talk fluently using words that usuallycause him to repeat, pause or prolongate sounds, sylla-bles, parts of words, entire words or phrases.Causes and symptoms\\nThere is no known cause of stuttering. Some believe\\nthat it has a physical cause and that it might be related toa breakdown in the neurological system. Stuttering startsearly in life and often is inherited. Brain scan researchhas revealed that there might be abnormalities in thebrains of stutterers, while they are stuttering. Mythsabout why stuttering occurs abound. Some culturesbelieve that stuttering is caused by emotional problems,tickling an infant too much or because a mother ateimproperly during breastfeeding. None have been provento be true. It is believed that some drugs might inducestuttering-like conditions. These include antidepressants,antihistamines , tranquilizers and selective serotonin\\nreuptake inhibitors .\\nDiagnosis\\nSpeech and language therapists diagnose stuttering\\nby asking stutterers to read out loud, pronounce specificwords, and talk. Some also order hearing tests. The testswill determine whether or not a person needs speechtherapy.\\nTreatment\\nResearchers don’t understand what causes stuttering.\\nHowever, progress has been made into what contributesto the development of the disability and, therefore, insome cases it can be prevented in childhood with the helpof therapy early on. Therapy can help people of all agessuffering from the speech disability. While not anovernight cure, therapy can offer positive results andmore fluent speech patterns. The goals of therapy are toreduce stuttering frequency, decrease the tension andstruggle of stuttering, become educated about stuttering,and learn to use effective communications skills, such asmaking eye contact, to further enhance speech. The thera-py focuses on helping stutterers to discover easier and dif-ferent ways of producing sounds and expressing thoughts.The success of therapy depends largely on the stutterer’swillingness to work at getting better.\\nThe duration of stuttering therapy needed varies\\namong stutterers. Sometimes, it helps stutterers if theyhave therapy intermittently throughout their lives.\\nParents, teachers and others can do things to help\\nease stuttering. These include: talking slowly, but nor-mally, clearly, and in a relaxed manner to a stutterer;answering questions after a pause to encourage a relaxedtransaction; trying not to make stuttering worse by get-ting annoyed by a person’s stuttering; giving stutterersreassurance about their stuttering; and encouraging thestutterer to talk about his or her stuttering.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3199StutteringGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3199'),\n",

This\\narea, called the subarachnoid space, normally containscerebrospinal fluid. The accumulation of blood in the sub-arachnoid space can lead to stroke , seizures, and other\\ncomplications. Additionally, subarachnoid hemorrhagesmay cause permanent brain damage and a number ofharmful biochemical events in the brain. A subarachnoidhemorrhage and the related problems are frequently fatal.\\nDescription\\nSubarachnoid hemorrhages are classified into two\\ngeneral categories: traumatic and spontaneous. Traumat-ic refers to brain injury that might be sustained in anaccident or a fall. Spontaneous subarachnoid hemor-rhages occur with little or no warning and are frequentlycaused by ruptured aneurysms or blood vessel abnormal-ities in the brain.\\nTraumatic brain injury is a critical problem in the\\nUnited States. According to annual figures compiled bythe Brain Injury Association, approximately 373,000people are hospitalized, more than 56,000 people die,and 99,000 survive with permanent disabilities due totraumatic brain injuries. The leading causes of injury arebicycle, motorcycle, and automobile accidents, with asignificant minority due to accidental falls, and sportsand recreation mishaps.\\nExact statistics are not available on traumatic sub-\\narachnoid hemorrhages, but several large clinical studieshave found an incidence of 23–39% in relation to severehead injury . Furthermore, subarachnoid hemorrhages\\nhave been described in the medical literature as the mostcommon brain injury found during autopsy investiga-\\ntions of head trauma.\\nSpontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhages are often\\ndue to an aneurysm (a bulge or sac-like projection from ablood vessel) which bursts. Arteriovenous malforma-\\ntions (A VMs), which are abnormal interfaces between\\narteries and veins, may also rupture and release bloodinto the subarachnoid space. Both aneurysms and A VMsare associated with weak spots in the walls of blood ves-sels and account for approximately 60% of all sponta-neous subarachnoid hemorrhages. The rest may be attrib-uted to other causes, such as cancer or infection, or are\\nof unknown origin.\\nIn industrialized countries, it is estimated that there\\nare 6.5–26.4 cases of spontaneous subarachnoid hemor-rhage per 100,000 people annually. Certain factors raisethe risk of suffering a hemorrhage. Aneurysms areacquired over a person’s lifetime and are rarely a factor insubarachnoid hemorrhage before age 20. Conversely,A VMs are present at birth. In some cases, there may be agenetic predisposition for aneurysms or A VMs. Other fac-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3201Subarachnoid hemorrhageGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3201'),\n",

The exact\\nrole of high blood pressure is somewhat unclear, but sinceit does seem linked to the formation of aneurysms, it maybe considered an indirect risk factor.\\nThe immediate danger due to subarachnoid hemor-\\nrhage, whether traumatic or spontaneous, is ischemia .\\nIschemia refers to tissue damage caused by restricted orblocked blood flow. The areas of the brain that do notreceive adequate blood and oxygen can suffer irreparableinjury, leading to permanent brain damage or death . An\\nindividual who survives the initial hemorrhage is suscep-tible to a number of complications in the followinghours, days, and weeks.\\nThe most common complications are intracranial\\nhypertension , vasospasm, and hydrocephalus . Intracra-\\nnial hypertension, or high pressure within the brain, canlead to further bleeding from damaged blood vessels; acomplication associated with a 70% fatality rate.Vasospasm, or blood vessel constriction, is a principalcause of secondary ischemia. The blood vessels in thebrain constrict in reaction to chemicals released by bloodbreaking down within the subarachnoid space. As theblood vessels become narrower, blood flow in the brainbecomes increasingly restricted. Approximately onethird of spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhages and 30-60% of traumatic bleeds are followed by vasospasm.Hydrocephalus, an accumulation of fluid in the chambersof the brain (ventricles) due to restricted circulation ofcerebrospinal fluid, follows approximately 15% of sub-arachnoid hemorrhages. Because cerebrospinal fluidcannot drain properly, pressure accumulates on the brain,possibly prompting further ischemic complications.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nWhether through trauma or disease, subarachnoid\\nhemorrhages are caused by blood being released by adamaged blood vessel and accumulating in the subarach-noid space. Symptoms associated with traumatic sub-arachnoid hemorrhage may or may not resemble thoseassociated with spontaneous hemorrhage, as trauma caninvolve multiple injuries with overlapping symptoms.\\nTypically, a spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage is\\nindicated by a sudden, severe headache . Nausea, vomiting,\\nand dizziness frequently accompany the pain. Loss of con-\\nsciousness occurs in about half the cases of spontaneoushemorrhage. A coma , usually brief, may occur. A stiff\\nneck, fever , and aversion to light may appear following the\\nhemorrhage. Neurologic symptoms may include partialparalysis , loss of vision, seizures, and speech difficulties.Spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhages may be\\npreceded by warning signs prior to the initial bleed. Sen-tinel, or warning, headaches may be present in the daysor weeks before an aneurysm or A VM ruptures. Theseheadaches can be accompanied by dizziness, nausea, andvomiting, and possibly neurologic symptoms. Approxi-mately 50% of A VMs are discovered before they bleedsignificantly; however, most aneurysms are not diag-nosed before they rupture.\\nDiagnosis\\nTo make a diagnosis, a health-care provider takes a\\ndetailed history of the symptoms and does a physical\\nexamination . The symptoms may mimic other disorders\\nand diagnosis can be complicated, especially if the indi-vidual is unconscious. The sudden, severe headache canfuel suspicion of a subarachnoid hemorrhage or similarevent, and a computed tomography scan (CT scan) ormagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is considered\\nessential to a quick diagnosis. The MRI is less sensitivethan the CT in detecting acute subarachnoid bleeding,but more sensitive in diagnosing A VM or aneurysm.\\nA CT scan reveals blood that has escaped into the sub-\\narachnoid space. For the best results, the scan should bedone within 12 hours of the hemorrhage. If this is not pos-sible, lumbar puncture and examination of the cere-brospinal fluid is advised. Lumbar puncture is also done incases in which the CT scan doesn’t reveal a hemorrhage,but there is a high suspicion that one has occurred. In sub-arachnoid hemorrhage, cerebrospinal fluid shows red bloodcells and/or xanthochromia, a yellowish tinge caused byblood breakdown products. Xanthochromia first appearssix to 12 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage, making itadvisable to delay lumbar puncture until at least 12 hoursafter the onset of symptoms for a more definite diagnosis.\\nOnce a hemorrhage, A VM, or aneurysm has been\\ndiagnosed, further tests are done to pinpoint the damage.The CT scan may be useful in giving the general loca-tion, but cerebral angiography maps out the exact\\ndetails.

It is most oftencaused by torn, bleeding veins on the inside of the duraas a result of a blow to the head.\\nDescription\\nSubdural hematomas most often affect people who\\nare prone to falling. Only a slight hit on the head or evena fall to the ground without hitting the head may beenough to tear veins in the brain, often without fracturingthe skull. There may be no external evidence of the bruis-ing on the brain’s surface.\\nSmall subdural hematomas may not be very serious,\\nand the blood can be slowly absorbed over severalweeks. Larger hematomas, however, can graduallyenlarge over several weeks, even though the bleeding hasstopped. This enlargement can compress the brain itself,possibly leading to death if the blood is not drained.\\nThe time between the injury and the appearance of\\nsymptoms can vary from less than 48 hours to severalweeks, or more. Symptoms appearing in less than 48hours are due to an acute subdural hematoma. This typeof bleeding is often fatal, and results from tearing of thevenous sinus. If more than two weeks have passed beforesymptoms appear, the condition is called a chronic sub-dural hematoma, resulting from tearing of the smallervein. The young and the old are most likely to experiencea chronic condition. This chronic form is less risky, aspressure of the veins against the skull lessens the bleed-ing. Prompt medical care can reduce the probability ofpermanent brain damage.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA subdural hematoma is caused by an injury to the\\nhead that tears blood vessels. In childhood, hematomasare a common complication of falls. A subdural hema-toma also may be an indication of child abuse , as evi-\\ndenced by shaken baby syndrome .\\nSymptoms tend to fluctuate, and include:\\n•headache\\n• episodes of confusion and drowsiness\\n• one-sided weakness or paralysis\\n• lethargy\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3204Subdural hematomaGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3204'),\n",

Althoughthere are on-going debates on the exact distinctionsbetween substance abuse and substance dependence, thecurrent practice standard—distinguishes between the twoby defining substance dependence in terms of physiolog-ical and behavioral symptoms of substance use, and sub-stance abuse in terms of the social consequences of sub-stance use.\\nSubstance abuse is any pattern of substance use that\\nresults in repeated adverse social consequences related todrug-taking—for example, failure to meet work, family,or school obligations, interpersonal conflicts, or legalproblems. Substance dependence, commonly known asaddiction , is characterized by physiological and behav-\\nioral symptoms related to substance use. These symp-toms include the need for increasing amounts of the sub-stance to maintain desired effects, withdrawal if drug-taking ceases, and an inordinate amount of time spent inactivities related to substance use.\\nSubstance abuse is more likely to be diagnosed\\namong those who have just begun drug-taking and isoften an early symptom of substance dependence. How-ever, substance dependence can appear without sub-stance abuse, and substance abuse can persist forextended periods of time without a transition to sub-stance dependence.\\nDescription\\nSubstance abuse and dependence are disorders that\\naffect all population groups although specific patterns ofabuse and dependence vary with age, gender, culture, andsocioeconomic status. According to data from theNational Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey,13.3% of the nationally representative survey groupexhibited symptoms of alcohol dependence during theirlifetime, and 4.4% exhibited symptoms of alcohol depen-dence during the past 12 months. According to the 1997National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, 6.4% ofthose surveyed had used an illicit drug in the past month.\\nAlthough substance dependence can begin at any age,\\npersons aged 18 to 24 have relatively high substance userates, and that dependence often arises sometime duringthe ages of 20 to 49. Gender proportions vary according tothe class of drugs, but substance use disorders are in gen-eral more frequently seen in men.\\nIn addition to being an individual health disorder,\\nsubstance abuse and dependence may be viewed as apublic health problem with far-ranging health, economic,and adverse social implications. Substance-related disor-ders are associated with teen pregnancy and the trans-\\nmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), as\\nwell as failure in school, unemployment, domestic vio-lence, homelessness, and crimes such as rape and sexu-\\nal assault , aggravated assault, robbery, burglary, and lar-\\nceny. According to the National Institute on AlcoholAbuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), the estimated cost ofalcohol-related disorders alone (including health careexpenditures, lost productivity, and premature death )\\nwas $166.5 billion in 1995.\\nThe term substance, when discussed in the context of\\nsubstance abuse and dependence, refers to medications,drugs of abuse, and toxins. These substances have anintoxicating effect, desired by the user, which can haveeither stimulating (speeding up) or depressive/sedating(slowing down) effects on the body. Substance depen-dence and/or abuse can involve any of the following 10classes of substances:\\n• alcohol• amphetamines (including “crystal meth,” some medica-\\ntions used in the treatment of attention deficit disorder[ADD], and amphetamine-like substances found inappetite suppressants)\\n• cannibis (including marijuana and hashish)\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3206Substance abuse and dependenceGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3206'),\n",

In many\\ncases, a prescription medication that becomes a sub-stance of abuse may have been a legal, medically indicat-ed prescription for the user, but the pattern of usediverges from the use prescribed by the physician.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe causes of substance dependence are not well-\\nestablished, but three factors are believed to contribute tosubstance-related disorders: genetic factors, psy-chopathology, and social learning. In genetic epidemio-logical studies of alcoholism, the probability of identicaltwins both exhibiting alcohol dependence was signifi-cantly greater than with fraternal twins, thus suggesting agenetic component in alcoholism. It is unclear, however,whether the genetic factor is related to alcoholism direct-ly, or whether it is linked to other psychiatric disordersthat are known to be associated with substance abuse.For example, there is evidence that alcoholic males fromfamilies with depressive disorders tend to have more\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3207Substance abuse and dependence\\nPULMONARY\\n\"Narcotic lung\"Talc granulomas\\nLOCAL\\nAbscessesCellulitisUlcersThrombosed veinsRENAL\\nGlomerulopathyINFECTIONS\\nBacterial endocarditisViral hepatitisAIDS (lymph nodes)BRAIN\\nOverdoseComaHallucinations\\nSubstance abuse often causes a variety of medical abnormalities and conditions throughout the body, as shown in the illus-\\ntration above.

In this model, the psychopathology is the cause of on-going substance use because individuals use the substanceto alleviate their subjective experience of the pathology.Unless the underlying pathology is treated, attempts to per-manently stop substance dependence are ineffective. Psy-chopathologies that are associated with substance depen-dence include antisocial personality disorder, bipolar disor-\\nder, depression, anxiety disorder, and schizophrenia .\\nA third factor related to substance dependence is\\nsocial environment. In this model, drug-taking is essential-ly a socially learned behavior. Local social norms deter-mine the likelihood that a person is exposed to the sub-stance and whether continued use is reinforced. For exam-ple, individuals may, by observing family or peer rolemodels, learn that substance use is a normal way to relievedaily stresses. External penalties, such as legal or socialsanctions, may reduce the likelihood of substance use.\\nAt the level of neurobiology, it is believed that sub-\\nstances of abuse operate through similar pathways in thebrain (one well-known pathway is the “mesolimbicdopamine system” or “mesolimbic reward pathway”).The chemical changes induced by the stimulation ofthese pathways by initial use of the substance lead to thedesire to continue substance use, possibly leading to sub-stance dependence.\\nSymptoms\\nThe DSM-IV-TR identifies seven criteria (symptoms),\\nat least three of which must be met during a given 12-month period, for the diagnosis of substance dependence:\\n• Tolerance, as defined either by the need for increasing\\namounts of the substance to obtain the desired effect orby experiencing less effect with extended use of thesame amount of the substance.\\n• Withdrawal, as exhibited either by experiencing unpleas-\\nant mental, physiological, and emotional changes whendrug-taking ceases or by using the substance as a way torelieve or prevent withdrawal symptoms.\\n• Substance is taken for a longer duration or in greater\\nquantities than was originally intended.\\n• Persistent desire or repeated unsuccessful efforts to\\nstop or attenuate substance use.\\n• A relatively large amount of time spent in securing and\\nusing the substance, or in recovering from the effects ofthe substance.• Important work and social activities reduced because of\\nsubstance use.\\n• Continued substance use despite negative physical and\\npsychological effects of use.\\nAlthough not explicitly listed in the DSM-IV-TR\\ncriteria, “craving,” or the overwhelming desire to use thesubstance regardless of countervailing forces, is a univer-sally-reported symptom of substance dependence.\\nSymptoms of substance abuse, as specified by\\nDSM-IV-TR, include one or more of the followingoccurring during a given 12-month period:\\n• Substance use resulting in a recurrent failure to fulfill\\nwork, school, or home obligations (e.g. work absences,substance-related school suspensions, neglect of chil-dren).\\n• Substance use in physically hazardous situations such\\nas driving or operating machinery.\\n• Substance use resulting in legal problems such as drug-\\nrelated arrests.\\n• Continued substance use despite negative social and\\nrelationship consequences of use.\\nIn addition to the general symptoms, there are other\\nphysical signs and symptoms of substance abuse that arerelated to specific drug classes:\\n• Signs and symptoms of alcohol intoxication are well-\\nknown; these include such physical signs as slurredspeech, lack of coordination, unsteady gait, memoryimpairment, and stupor, as well as behavior changesmanifesting themselves shortly after alcohol ingestion,including inappropriate aggressive behavior, moodvolatility, and impaired functioning.\\n• Amphetamine users may exhibit rapid heartbeat, elevat-\\ned or depressed blood pressure, dilated (enlarged)pupils, weight loss, as well as excessively high energy,inability to sleep, confusion, and occasional paranoidpsychotic behavior.\\n• Cannibis users may exhibit red eyes with dilated pupils,\\nincreased appetite, dry mouth , and rapid pulse; they\\nmay also be sluggish and slow to react.\\n• Cocaine users may exhibit rapid heart rate, elevated or\\ndepressed blood pressure, dilated pupils, weight loss, inaddition to wide variations in their energy-level, severemood disturbances, psychosis , and paranoia .\\n• Users of hallucinogens may exhibit anxiety or depres-\\nsion, paranoia, and unusual behavior in response to hal-\\nlucinations (imagined sights, voices, sounds, or smells\\nthat appear real).

They may display inappropriatebehavior, mood volatility, and impaired functioning.\\nOther signs are related to the form in which the sub-\\nstance is used. For example, heroin, certain other opioiddrugs, and certain forms of cocaine may be injected. Aperson using an injectable substance may have “trackmarks” (outwardly visible signs of the site of an injec-tion, with possible redness and swelling of the vein inwhich the substance was injected). Furthermore, poorjudgment brought on by substance use can result in theinjections being made under dangerously unhygienicconditions. These unsanitary conditions and the use ofshared needles are risk factors for major infections of theheart, as well as infection with HIV (the virus that causesAIDS ), certain forms of hepatitis (a liver infection), and\\ntuberculosis .\\nCocaine is often taken as a powdery substance\\nwhich is “snorted” through the nose. This can result infrequent nosebleeds, sores in the nose, and even erosion(an eating away) of the nasal septum (the structure thatseparates the two nostrils).\\nOverdosing on a substance is a frequent complica-\\ntion of substance abuse. Drug overdose can be purpose-\\nful (with suicide as a goal), or due to carelessness, theunpredictable strength of substances purchased fromstreet dealers, mixing of more than one type of sub-stance, or as a result of the increasing doses that a personmust take to experience intoxicating effects. Substanceoverdose can be a life-threatening emergency, with thespecific symptoms depending on the type of substanceused. Substances with depressive effects may dangerous-ly slow the breathing and heart rate, drop the body tem-perature, and result in a general unresponsiveness. Sub-stances with stimulatory effects may dangerouslyincrease the heart rate and blood pressure, produce\\nabnormal heart rhythms, increase body temperature,induce seizures, and cause erratic behavior.\\nDiagnosis\\nTools used in the diagnosis of substance dependence\\ninclude screening questionnaires and patient histories,physical examination , and laboratory tests. A simple and\\npopular screening tool is the CAGE questionnaire. CAGErefers to the first letters of each word that forms the basisof each of the four questions of the screening exam:\\n• have you ever tried to Cut down on your substance use?• have you ever been Annoyed by people trying to talk to\\nyou about your substance use?\\n• do you ever feel Guilty about your substance use?\\n• do you ever need an Eye opener (use of the substance\\nfirst thing in the morning) in order to start your day?\\nA “yes” answer to two or more of these questions is\\nan indication that the individual should be referred formore thorough work-up for substance dependency orabuse.\\nIn addition to CAGE, other screening questionnaires\\nare available. Some are designed for particular popula-tion groups such as pregnant women, and others aredesigned to more thoroughly assess the severity of sub-stance dependence. These questionnaires, known by theiracronyms, include AUDIT, HSS, HSQ, PRIME-MD,ACE, TWEAK, s-MAST, and SADD. There is somevariability among questionnaires in terms of how accu-rately and comprehensively they can identify individualsas substance dependent.\\nPatient history, as taken through the direct interview,\\nis important for identifying physical symptoms and psy-chiatric factors related to substance use. Family historyof alcohol or other substance dependency is also usefulfor diagnosis.\\nA physical examination may reveal signs of sub-\\nstance abuse. These signs are specific to the substancesused, as well as needle marks, tracks, or nasal erosion.\\nWith the individual’s permission, substance use can\\nbe detected through laboratory testing of his or herblood, urine, or hair. Laboratory testing, however, maybe limited by the sensitivity and specificity of the testingmethod, and by the time elapsed since the person lastused the drug.\\nOne of the most difficult aspects of diagnosis\\ninvolves overcoming the patient’s denial. Denial is a psy-chological state during which a person is unable toacknowledge the (usually negative) circumstances of a\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3209Substance abuse and dependenceGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3209'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 914}, page_content='situation. In this case, denial leads a person to underesti-\\nmate the degree of substance use and of the problemsassociated with substance use.\\nTreatment\\nAccording to the American Psychiatric Association,\\nthere are three goals for the treatment of persons withsubstance use disorders: (1) the patient abstains from orreduces the use and effects of the substance; (2) thepatient reduces the frequency and severity of relapses;and (3) the patient develops the psychological and emo-tional skills necessary to restore and maintain personal,occupational, and social functioning.\\nIn general, before treatment can begin, many treat-\\nment centers require that the patient undergo detoxifica-\\ntion. Detoxification is the process of weaning the patient\\nfrom his or her regular substance use. Detoxification canbe accomplished “cold turkey,” by complete and immedi-ate cessation of all substance use, or by slowly decreas-ing (tapering) the dose which a person is taking, to mini-mize the side effects of withdrawal. Some substancesmust be tapered because “cold turkey” methods of detox-ification are potentially life threatening. In some cases,medications may be used to combat the unpleasant andthreatening physical and psychological symptoms ofwithdrawal. For example, methadone is used to helppatients adjust to the tapering of heroin use.\\nTreatment itself consists of three parts: (1) assess-\\nment; (2) formulation of a treatment plan; (3) psychiatricmanagement. The first step in treatment is a comprehen-sive medical and psychiatric evaluation of the patient.This evaluation includes:\\n• a history of the patient’s past and current substance use,\\nand its cognitive, psychological, physiological, andbehavioral effects\\n• a medical and psychiatric history and examination• a history of psychiatric treatments and outcomes\\n• a family and social history\\n• screening of blood, breath, or urine for substances\\n• other laboratory tests to determine the presence of other\\nconditions commonly found with substance use disorders\\nAfter the assessment is made, a treatment plan is for-\\nmulated. Treatment plans vary according to the needs ofthe specific patient and can change for the same patientas he or she undergoes different phases of the disorder.Plans typically involve the following elements: (1) astrategy for the psychiatric management of the patient;(2) a strategy for reducing effects or use of substances, orfor abstinence; (3) efforts to ensure compliance with thetreatment program and to prevent relapse; (4) treatmentsfor other conditions associated with substance use. Initial\\ntherapy and treatment setting (hospital, residential treat-ment, partial hospitalization, outpatient) decisions aremade as part of the treatment plan, but because substanceuse disorders are considered a chronic condition requir-ing long-term care, these plans can and do changethrough the course of treatment.\\nThe third step, psychiatric management of the patient,\\nis the implementation of the treatment plan. Psychiatricmanagement of the patient includes establishing a trustingrelationship between clinician and patient; monitoring thepatient’s progress; managing the patient’s relapses andwithdrawal; diagnosing and treating associated psychiatricdisorders; and helping the patient adhere to the treatmentplan through therapy and the development of skills andsocial interactions that reinforce a drug-free lifestyle.\\nAs part of the treatment process, patients typically\\nundergo psychosocial therapy and, in some cases, phar-macologic treatment. Psychosocial therapeutic modali-ties include cognitive-behavioral therapy , behavioral\\ntherapy, individual psychodynamic or interpersonal ther-apy, group therapy ,family therapy , and self-help\\ngroups. Pharmacologic treatment may include medica-tions that ease withdrawal symptoms, reduce craving,interact negatively with substances of abuse to discour-age drug-taking, or treat associated psychiatric disorders.\\nAlternative treatment\\nThe efficacy of alternative treatments for substance\\nuse disorders remains for the most part ambiguous. Onetreatment that has been recently shown to have variablesuccess is the use of acupuncture in treating substance\\ndependence. In 2000, a randomized controlled trial of theeffect of acupuncture on cocaine addiction reported thatacupuncture significantly reduced the cocaine use of studyparticipants. A 1999 meta-analysis (summary analysis ofstudies), however, reported that acupuncture had no statis-tically significant effect on smoking cessation.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3210Substance abuse and dependenceFrequency Of Substance Abuse By Gender And Age\\nMen\\nAges 18 to 29 17 to 24 percent\\nAges 30 to 44 11 to 14 percentAges 45 to 64 6 to 8 percentOver age 65 1 to 3 percent\\nWomen\\nAges 18 to 29 4 to 10 percent\\nAges 30 to 44 2 to 4 percentAges 45 to 64 1 to 2 percentOver age 65 less than 1 percentGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3210'),\n",

In particular, there has been someinterest in Pueraria lobata , or kudzu, an herb that has\\nreputedly been used in Chinese medicine to treat alco-holism. Preclinical trials of an herbal formula with kudzuhave shown that increased consumption of the herbal for-mula is associated with decreased consumption of alco-hol. Toxicity studies show few ill effects of the formula,and human trials are currently being undertaken to morefully evaluate the efficacy of this treatment.\\nThe effectiveness of electroacupuncture (the practice\\nof acupuncture accompanied by the application of lowlevels of electrical current at acupuncture points) in alle-viating opiate withdrawal symptoms is also being exam-ined. Preclinical trials suggest that electroacupuncturetreatment given prior to the administration of naxolone (amedication that counteracts the effects of opiates but pre-cipitates withdrawal symptoms) seems to to alleviate thewithdrawal effects of naxolone.\\nPrognosis\\nRecovery from substance use is notoriously diffi-\\ncult, even with exceptional treatment resources.Although relapse rates are difficult to accurately obtain,the NIAAA cites evidence that 90% of alcohol depen-dent users experience at least one relapse within the 4years after treatment. Relapse rates for heroin and nico-tine users are believed to be similar. Certain pharmaco-logical treatments, however, have been shown to reducerelapse rates.\\nRelapses are most likely to occur within the first 12\\nmonths of having discontinued substance use. Triggersfor relapses can include any number of life stresses(problems on the job or in the marriage, loss of a rela-tionship, death of a loved one, financial stresses), in addi-tion to seemingly mundane exposure to a place or anacquaintance associated with previous substance use.\\nThe development of adaptive life skills and on-going\\ndrug-free social support are believed to be two importantfactors in avoiding relapse. The effect of the supportgroup Alcoholics Anonymous has been intensively stud-ied, and a 1996 meta-analysis noted that long-term sobri-ety appears to be positively related to Alcoholics Anony-mous attendance and involvement. Support for familymembers in addition to support for the individual inrecovery is also important. Because substance depen-dence has a serious impact on family functioning, andbecause family members may inadvertently maintainbehaviors that initially led to the substance dependence,on-going therapy and support for family members shouldnot be neglected.KEY TERMS\\nAddiction —The state of being both physically and\\npsychologically dependent on a substance.\\nDependence —A state in which a person requires\\na steady concentration of a particular substance toavoid experiencing withdrawal symptoms.\\nDetoxification —A process whereby an addict is\\nwithdrawn from a substance.\\nIntoxication —The desired mental, physical, or\\nemotional state produced by a substance.\\nStreet drug —A substance purchased from a drug\\ndealer; may be a legal substance, sold illicitly(without a prescription, and not for medical use),or it may be a substance which is illegal to possess.\\nTolerance —A phenomenon whereby a drug user\\nbecomes physically accustomed to a particulardose of a substance, and requires increasingdosages in order to obtain the same effects.\\nWithdrawal —Those side effects experienced by a\\nperson who has become physically dependent ona substance, upon decreasing the substance’sdosage or discontinuing its use.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention is best aimed at teenagers and young\\nadults aged 18–24 who are at very high risk for sub-stance experimentation.

SCD issometimes called cardiac arrest.\\nDescription\\nWhen the heart suddenly stops beating effectively\\nand breathing ceases, a person is said to have experi-enced sudden cardiac death.\\nSCD is not the same as actual death. In actual death,\\nthe brain also dies. The important difference is that sud-den cardiac death is potentially reversible. If it isreversed quickly enough, the brain will not die.Sudden cardiac death is also not the same as a heart\\nattack . A heart attack (myocardial infarction) is the\\nresult of a blockage in an artery which feeds the heart, sothe heart becomes starved for oxygen. The part that hasbeen starved is damaged beyond repair, but the heart canstill beat effectively.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSudden cardiac death is usually caused by ventric-\\nular fibrillation (the lower chamber of the heart quiv-\\ners instead of pumping in an organized rhythm). Ven-tricular fibrillation almost never returns to normal byitself, so the condition requires immediate intervention.Ventricular tachycardia can also lead to sudden car-\\ndiac death. The risk for SCD is higher for anyone withheart disease.\\nWhen the heart stops beating effectively and the\\nbrain is being deprived of oxygenated blood, a medicalemergency exists.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of sudden cardiac death is made when\\nthere is a sudden loss of consciousness, breathing stops,and there is no effective heart beat.\\nTreatment\\nWhen sudden cardiac death occurs, the first priority\\nis to establish the flow of oxygenated blood to the brain.The next priority is to restore normal rhythm to the heart.Forcing air into the mouth will get oxygen into the lungs.Compressing the chest simulates a pumping heart andwill get some blood flow to the lungs, brain, and coro-nary arteries. This method is called cardiopulmonary\\nresuscitation (CPR ). When trained help arrives, they\\nwill attempt to establish a normal heart beat by using adevice called a defibrillator.\\nIf sudden cardiac death occurs outside the hospital\\nsetting, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) mustbegin within four to six minutes and advanced life sup-\\nport measures must begin within eight minutes, to\\navoid brain death. CPR requires no special medicalskills and training is available for the ordinary personnationwide.\\nPrognosis\\nSudden cardiac death is reversible in most people if\\ntreatment is begun quickly. However, of the people whoare resuscitated, 40% will have another SCD within twoyears if they do not receive appropriate treatment for theunderlying cause of the episode.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3212Sudden cardiac deathGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3212'),\n",

In the 1990s, advances havebeen made in preventing the occurrence of SIDS, whichkilled more than 4,800 babies in 1992 and 3,279 infantsin 1995.

It accounts for about 10% of deaths occurringduring the first year of life. SIDS most commonly affectsbabies between the ages of two months and six months; italmost never strikes infants younger than two weeks ofage or older than eight months. Most SIDS deaths occurbetween midnight and 8 \\nA.M.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nRisk factors for SIDS\\nThe exact causes of SIDS are still unknown,\\nalthough studies have shown that many of the infants hadrecently been under a doctor’s care for a cold or other ill-ness of the upper respiratory tract. Most SIDS deathsoccur during the winter and early spring, which are thepeak times for respiratory infections. The most commonrisk factors for SIDS include:\\n• sleeping on the stomach (in the prone position)\\n• mother who smokes during pregnancy ; smokers are as\\nmuch as three times more likely than nonsmokers tohave a SIDS baby\\n• the presence of passive smoke in the household\\n• male sex. The male/female ratio in SIDS deaths is 3:2\\n• belonging to an economically deprived or minority\\nfamily\\n• mother under 20 years of age at pregnancy\\n• mother who abuses drugs• mother with little or no prenatal care\\n• prematurity or low weight at birth\\n• family history of SIDS\\nMost of these risk factors are associated with signifi-\\ncantly higher rates of SIDS; however, none of them areexact enough to be useful in predicting which specificchildren may die from SIDS.\\nTheories about SIDS\\nMEDICAL DISORDERS. Currently it is not known\\nwhether the immediate cause of death from SIDS is a heartproblem or a sudden interruption of breathing. The mostconsistent autopsy findings are pinpoint hemorrhages\\ninside the baby’s chest and mild inflammation or conges-tion of the nose, throat, and airway. Some doctors havethought that the children stop breathing because their upperairway gets blocked. Others have suggested that the chil-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3213Sudden infant death syndromeGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3213'),\n",

A third theory con-cerns the possibility that SIDS infants have an underlyingabnormality in the central nervous system. This suggestionis based on the assumption that normal infants sense whentheir air supply is inadequate and wake up. Babies with anabnormal nervous system, however, do not have the samealarm mechanism in their brains. Other theories about thecause of death in SIDS include immune system disordersthat cause changes in the baby’s heart rate and breathingpatterns during sleep, or a metabolic disorder that causes abuildup of fatty acids in the baby’s system.\\nPHYSICAL SURROUNDINGS. A recent theory pro-\\nposes that SIDS is connected to the child’s rebreathing ofstale air trapped in soft bedding. In addition to theinfant’s sleeping in the prone position, pillows, sheep-skins, and other soft items may contribute to trapping airaround the baby’s mouth and nose, which causes thebaby to breathe in too much carbon dioxide and notenough oxygen. Wrapping a baby too warmly has alsobeen proposed as a factor.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of SIDS is primarily a diagnosis of\\nexclusion. This means that it is given only after otherpossible causes of the baby’s death have been ruled out.Known risk factors aid in the diagnosis. Unlike the pat-tern in other diseases, however, the diagnosis of SIDScan only be given post-mortem. It is recommended thatall infants who die in their sleep receive an autopsy todetermine the cause. Autopsies indicate a definite expla-nation in about 20% of cases of sudden infant death. Inaddition, an autopsy can often put to rest any doubts theparents may have. Investigation of the location of thedeath is also useful in determining the child’s sleepingposition, bedding, room temperature, and similar factors.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no treatment for SIDS, only identification\\nof risk factors and preventive measures. The baby’s par-ents may benefit from referral to counseling and support\\ngroups for parents of SIDS victims.\\nPrevention\\nSIDS appears to be at least partly preventable, which\\nhas been shown by a decrease in the case rate. The fol-lowing are recommended as preventive measures:\\n• Sleep position. The United States Department of Health\\nand Human Services initiated a “Back-to-Sleep” cam-paign in 1994 to educate the public about sleep position.Prior to that time, an estimated 70% of infants slept ontheir stomachs, since parents had been taught that a“back down” position contributed to choking during\\nsleep. There are some conditions for which doctors willrecommend the prone position, but for normal infants,side or back (supine) positions are better. When placingan infant on his or her side, the parent should pull thechild’s lower arm forward so that he or she is less likelyto roll over onto the stomach. When babies are awakeand being observed, they should be placed on their stom-achs frequently to aid in the development of the musclesand skills involved in lifting the head. Once a baby canroll over to his or her stomach, he or she has developed tothe point where the risk of SIDS is minimal.\\n• Good prenatal care. Proper prenatal care can help pre-\\nvent the abnormalities that put children at higher riskfor SIDS. Mothers who do not receive prenatal care arealso more likely to have premature and low birth-weight babies. Expectant mothers should also bewarned about the risks of smoking , alcohol intake, and\\ndrug use during pregnancy.\\n• Proper bedding. Studies have shown that soft bedding,\\nsuch as beanbags, waterbeds and soft mattresses, con-tributes to SIDS. Babies should sleep on firm mattress-es with no soft or fluffy materials underneath or aroundthem—including quilts, pillows, thick comforters orlambskin. Soft stuffed toys should not be placed in thecrib while babies sleep.\\n• Room temperature. Although babies should be kept\\nwarm, they do not need to be any warmer than is com-fortable for the caregiver.

Room temperature andwrapping should keep the baby warm and comfortablebut not overheated.\\n• Diet. Some studies indicate that breastfed babies are at\\nlower risk for SIDS. It is thought that the mother’s milkmay provide additional immunity to the infections thatcan trigger sudden death in infants.\\n• Bedsharing with parents. Opinions differ on whether or\\nnot bedsharing of infant and mother increases or decreas-es the risk of SIDS. Bedsharing may encourage breast-feeding or alter sleep patterns, which could lower the riskof SIDS. On the other hand, some studies suggest thatbedsharing increases the risk of SIDS. In any case, moth-ers who choose to bring their babies to bed shouldobserve the following cautions: Soft sleep surfaces, aswell as quilts, blankets, comforters or pillows should notbe placed under the baby. Parents who sleep with theirinfants should not smoke around the baby, or use alcoholor other drugs which might make them difficult toarouse. Parents should also be aware that adult beds arenot built with the same safety features as infant cribs.\\n• Secondhand smoke. It is as important to keep the\\nbaby’s environment smoke-free during infancy as itwas when the mother was pregnant with the baby.\\n• Electronic monitoring. Electronic monitors are avail-\\nable for use in the home. These devices sound an alarmfor the parents if the child stops breathing. There is noevidence, however, that these monitors prevent SIDS.In 1986, experts consulted by the National Institutes ofHealth (NIH) recommended monitors only for infantsat risk. These infants include those who have had one ormore episodes of breath stopping; premature infantswith breathing difficulties; and babies with two or moreolder siblings that died of SIDS. Parents who use moni-tors should know how to use them properly and what tofor the baby if the alarm goes off.\\n• Immunizations. There is no evidence that immuniza-\\ntions increase the risk of SIDS. In fact, babies whoreceive immunizations on schedule are less likely to dieof SIDS.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nKemp, James S., et al. “Softness and Potential to Cause\\nRebreathing: Differences in Bedding Used by Infants atHigh and Low Risk for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.”Journal of Pediatrics 132 (Feb. 98): 234-238.\\nORGANIZATIONS\\nAssociation of SIDS and Infant Mortality Programs.

They are soldin tablet and liquid forms. Some commonly used sulfon-amides are sulfisoxazole (Gantrisin) and the combinationdrug sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Bactrim,Cotrim).\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\nsulfonamide, the strength of the medicine, and the med-ical problem for which it is being taken. Check with thephysician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist whofilled the prescription for the correct dosage.\\nAlways take sulfonamides exactly as directed. To\\nmake sure the infection clears up completely, take themedicine for as long as it has been prescribed. Do not stoptaking the drug just because symptoms begin to improve.Symptoms may return if the drug is stopped too soon.\\nSulfonamides work best when they are at constant\\nlevels in the blood. To help keep levels constant, take themedicine in doses spaced evenly through the day andnight. Do not miss any doses. For best results, take themedicine with a full glass of water and drink severalmore glasses of water every day. This will help preventsome of the medicine’s side effects.\\nPrecautions\\nSymptoms should begin to improve within a few\\ndays of beginning to take this medicine. If they do not, orif they get worse, check with the physician who pre-scribed the medicine.\\nAlthough such side effects are rare, some people\\nhave had severe and life-threatening reactions to sulfon-amides. These include sudden, severe liver damage, seri-ous blood problems, breakdown of the outer layer of theskin, and a condition called Stevens-Johnson syndrome,in which people get blisters around the mouth, eyes, oranus. Call a physician immediately if any of these signsof a dangerous reaction occur:\\n• skin rash or reddish or purplish spots on the skin• other skin problems, such as blistering or peeling•f e v e r\\n• sore throat• cough\\n• shortness of breath\\n• joint pain\\n• pale skin• yellow skin or eyes\\nThis medicine may cause dizziness . Anyone who\\ntakes sulfonamides should not drive, use machines or doanything else that might be dangerous until they havefound out how the drugs affect them.\\nSulfonamides may cause blood problems that can\\ninterfere with healing and lead to additional infections.Avoid injuries while taking this medicine. Be especiallycareful not to injure the mouth when brushing or flossingthe teeth or using a toothpick. Do not have dental workdone until the blood is back to normal.\\nThis medicine may increase sensitivity to sunlight.\\nEven brief exposure to sun can cause a severe sunburn\\nor a rash. While being treated with this medicine, avoidbeing in direct sunlight, especially between 10 \\nA.M. and 3\\nP.M.; wear a hat and tightly woven clothing that covers\\nthe arms and legs; use a sunscreen with a skin protectionfactor (SPF) of at least 15; protect the lips with a sunblock lipstick; and do not use tanning beds, tanningbooths, or sunlamps.\\nBabies under 2 months should not be given sulfon-\\namides unless their physician has ordered the medicine.\\nOlder people may be especially sensitive to the\\neffects of sulfonamides, increasing the chance ofunwanted side effects, such as severe skin problems andblood problems. Patients who are taking water pills(diuretics ) at the same time as sulfonamides may also be\\nmore likely to have these problems.\\nSpecial conditions\\nPeople with certain medical conditions or who are\\ntaking certain other medicines can have problems if theytake sulfonamides. Before taking these drugs, be sure tolet the physician know about any of these conditions:\\nALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions\\nto sulfonamides, water pills (diuretics), diabetes medi-cines, or glaucoma medicine in the past should let his or\\nher physician know before taking sulfonamides.

There are two types of ultravioletrays, UV A and UVB. UV A rays penetrate the skin moredeeply and can cause melanoma in susceptible people.UVB rays, which don’t penetrate as deeply, cause sun-burn and wrinkling. Most UVB rays are absorbed by sun-\\nscreens , but only about half the UV A rays are absorbed.\\nSkin cancer from sun overexposure is a serious\\nhealth problem in the United States, affecting almost amillion Americans each year. One out of 87 will developmalignant melanoma , the most serious type of skin can-\\ncer, and 7,300 of them will die each year.Fair-skinned people are most susceptible to sunburn,\\nbecause their skin produces only small amounts of theprotective pigment called melanin. People trying to get atan too quickly in strong sunlight are also more vulnera-ble to sunburn. While they have a lower risk, even thedarkest-skinned people can get skin cancer.\\nRepeated sun overexposure and burning can prema-\\nturely age the skin, causing yellowish, wrinkled skin.Overexposure can increase the risk of skin cancer, espe-cially a serious burn in childhood.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe ultraviolet rays in sunlight destroy cells in the\\nouter layer of the skin, damaging tiny blood vesselsunderneath. When the skin is burned, the blood vesselsdilate and leak fluid. Cells stop making protein. TheirDNA is damaged by the ultraviolet rays. Repeated DNAdamage can lead to cancer.\\nWhen the sun burns the skin, it triggers immune\\ndefenses which identify the burned skin as foreign. Atthe same time, the sun transforms a substance on the skinwhich interferes with this immune response. While thissubstance keeps the immune system from attacking aperson’s own skin, it also means that any malignant cellsin the skin will be able to grow freely.\\nSunburn causes skin to turn red and blister. Several\\ndays later, the dead skin cells peel off. In severe cases,the burn may occur with sunstroke (vomiting, fever and\\ncollapse).\\nDiagnosis\\nVisual inspection and a history of exposure to the sun.\\nTreatment\\nAspirin can ease pain and inflammation. Tender\\nskin should be protected against the sun until it hashealed. In addition, apply:\\n• calamine lotion\\n• sunburn cream or spray• cool tap water compress\\n• colloidal oatmeal (Aveeno) baths\\n• dusting powder to reduce chafing\\nPeople who are severely sunburned should see a\\ndoctor, who may prescribe corticosteroid cream to speedhealing.\\nAlternative treatment\\nOver-the-counter preparations containing aloe ( Aloe\\nbarbadensis ) are an effective treatment for sunburn, eas-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3218SunburnGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3218'),\n",

A variety of topical herbal remedies appliedas lotions, poltices, or compresses may also help relievethe effects of sunburn. Calendula ( Calendula officinalis )\\nis one of the most frequently recommended to reduceinflammation.\\nPrognosis\\nModerately burned skin should heal within a week.\\nWhile the skin will heal after a sunburn, the risk of skincancer increases with exposure and subsequent burns.Even one bad burn in childhood carries an increased riskof skin cancer.\\nPrevention\\nEveryone from age six months on should use a\\nwater-resistant sunscreen with a sun protective factor(SPF) of at least 15. Apply at least an ounce 15–30 min-utes before going outside. It should be reapplied everytwo hours (more often after swimming). Babies shouldbe kept completely out of the sun for the first six monthsof life, because their skin is thinner than older children.Sunscreens have not been approved for infants.\\nIn addition, people should:\\n• limit sun exposure to 15 minutes the first day, even if\\nthe weather is hazy, slowly increasing exposure daily\\n• reapply sunscreen every two hours (more often if\\nsweating or swimming)\\n• reapply waterproof sunscreen after swimming more\\nthan 80 minutes, after toweling off, or after perspiringheavily\\n• avoid the sun between 10 \\nA.M. and 3 P.M\\n• use waterproof sunscreen on legs and feet, since the sun\\ncan burn even through waterKEY TERMS\\nMalignant melanoma —The most deadly of the\\nthree types of skin cancer.\\nSunscreen —Products which block the damaging\\nrays of the sun.

About 15 minutes of\\nexposure a day helps the body make Vitamin D, which isimportant for healthy bones and teeth. But longer exposuremay cause many problems, from wrinkles to skin cancer .\\nOne particularly deadly form of skin cancer, malignant\\nmelanoma , has been on the rise in recent decades, as tan-\\nning has become more popular. Over the same period, sci-entists have warned that the thin layer of ozone that pro-tects life on Earth from the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) radiationis being depleted. This allows more UV radiation to getthrough, adding to the risk of overexposure.\\nSunscreens help protect against the sun’s damaging\\neffects. But just how much protection they provide is amatter of debate. The sun gives off two kinds of ultravio-let radiation, called UV-A and UV-B. For many years,experts thought that only UV-B was harmful. However,recent research suggests that UV-A may be just as dan-gerous as UV-B, although its effects may take longer toshow up. In particular, UV-A may have a role in causingmelanoma. Most sunscreen products contain ingredientsthat provide adequate protection only against UV-B rays.Even those labeled as “broad spectrum” sunscreens mayoffer only partial protection against UV-A radiation.Those containing the ingredient avobenzone give themost protection against UV-A rays.\\nSome medical experts are concerned that sunscreens\\ngive people a false sense of security, allowing them to stayin the sun longer than they should. Although sunscreensprotect the skin from burning, they may not protect againstother kinds of damage. A number of studies suggest thatpeople who use sunscreens may actually increase their riskof melanoma because they spend too much time in thesun. This does not mean that people should stop using sun-screens. It means that they should not rely on sunscreensalone for protection. According to the American Academy\\nof Dermatology, sunscreens should be one part of sun pro-tection, along with wide-brimmed hats and tightly-wovenclothing that covers the arms and legs.\\nDescription\\nMany brands of sunscreens are available, containing\\na variety of ingredients. The active ingredients work byabsorbing, reflecting, or scattering some or all of thesun’s rays. Most sunscreen products contain combina-tions of ingredients.\\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires\\nsunscreen products to carry a sun protection factor (SPF)rating on their labels. This number tells how well the sun-screen protects against burning. The higher the number,the longer a person can stay in the sun without burning.Sunscreen products are sold as lotions, creams, gels,\\noils, sprays, sticks, and lip balms, and can be boughtwithout a physician’s prescription.\\nRecommended dosage\\nBe sure to read the instructions that come with the\\nsunscreen. Some need to be applied as long as 1-2 hoursbefore sun exposure. Others should be applied 30 min-utes before exposure, and frequently during exposure.\\nApply sunscreen liberally to all exposed parts of the\\nskin, including the hands, feet, nose, ears, neck, scalp (ifthe hair is thin or very short), and eyelids. Take care notto get sunscreen in the eyes, as it can cause irritation. Usea lip balm containing sunscreen to protect the lips. Reap-ply sunscreen liberally every 1-2 hours—more frequent-ly when perspiring heavily. Sunscreen should also bereapplied after going in the water.\\nPrecautions\\nSunscreen alone will not provide full protection from\\nthe sun. When possible, wear a hat, long pants, a long-sleeved shirt, and sunglasses. Try to stay out of the sunbetween 10 \\nA.M. and 2 P.M. (11 A.M. to 3 P.M. Daylight\\nSaving Time), when the sun’s rays are strongest. The suncan damage the skin even on cloudy days, so get in thehabit of using a sunscreen every day. Be especially care-ful at high elevations or in areas with surfaces that reflectthe sun’s rays, such as sand, water, concrete, or snow.\\nSunlamps, tanning beds, and tanning booths were\\nonce thought to be safer than the sun, because they giveoff mainly UV-A rays. However, UV-A rays are nowknown to cause serious skin damage and may increasethe risk of melanoma. Health experts advise people notto use these tanning devices.\\nPeople with fair skin, blond, red or light brown hair,\\nand light colored eyes are at greatest risk for developingskin cancer. So are people with many large skin moles .\\nThese people should avoid exposure to the sun as much aspossible. However, even dark skinned people, includingAfrican Americans and Hispanic Americans may suffer skindamage from the sun and should be careful about exposure.\\nSunscreens should not be used on children under 6\\nmonths because of the risk of side effects. Instead, chil-dren this young should be kept out of the sun. Childrenover 6 months should be protected with clothing and sun-screens of at least SPF 15, preferably lotions.

Rheumatic\\nfever is an acute infectious disease caused by certain types\\nof streptococci bacteria. It usually starts with strep throat\\nor tonsillitis . These types of streptococci are able to cause\\ndisease throughout the body. The most serious damagecaused by rheumatic fever is to the valves in the heart. Atone time, rheumatic fever was the most common cause ofdamaged heart valves, and it still is in most developingcountries around the world. Rheumatic fever and rheumat-ic heart disease are still present in the industrialized coun-tries, but the incidence has dropped substantially.\\nRheumatic fever may appear in several different\\nforms. Sydenham’s chorea is one of five “major criteria”for the diagnosis of rheumatic fever. There are also four“minor criteria” and two types of laboratory tests associ-ated with the disease. The “Jones criteria” define the diag-nosis. They require laboratory evidence of a streptococcalinfection plus two or more of the criteria. The laboratoryevidence may be identification of streptococci from asore throat or antibodies to streptococcus in the blood.\\nThe most common criteria are arthritis and heart disease,occurring in half to three-quarters of the patients. Syden-ham’s chorea, characteristic nodules under the skin, and aspecific type of skin rash occur only 10% of the time.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause is only certain types of streptococci,\\ncalled “Lancefield Group A beta-hemolytic.” These par-ticular germs seem to be able to create an immuneresponse that attacks the body’s own tissues along withthe germs. Those tissues are joints, heart valves, skin,and brain.\\nMany patients suffer from strep throat, just before\\ndeveloping this new set of symptoms. They may alsohave joint pains without swelling, a condition known asarthralgia. Sydenham’s chorea will appear as uncontrol-lable twitching or jerking of any part of the body that isworse when trying to repress it but disappears with sleep.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause rheumatic fever is such a damaging disease,\\na complete evaluation should be done whenever it is sus-pected. This includes cultures for streptococci, bloodtests, and usually an electrocardiogram (heartbeat map-ping to detect abnormalities).\\nTreatment\\nSuspected streptococcus infections must be treated.\\nAll the other manifestations of rheumatic fever, includingSydenham’s chorea and excluding heart valve damage,remit with the acute disease and do not require treatment.Sydenham’s chorea generally lasts for several months.\\nPrognosis\\nSyndenham’s chorea clears up without complica-\\ntions when the rheumatic fever is treated. The heart valvedamage associated with rheumatic fever may lead toheart trouble and require a surgical valve repair orreplacement.\\nPrevention\\nAll strep throats should be treated with a full 10 days\\nof antibiotics (penicillin or erythromycin). Treatment\\nmay best be delayed a day or two to allow the body tobuild up its own antibodies. In addition, for those whohave had an episode of rheumatic fever or have damagedheart valves from any other cause, prophylactic antibi-otics should be continued to prevent recurrence.\\nIt is possible to eradicate dangerous streptococcus\\nfrom a community by culturing everyone’s throat andtreating everyone who tests positive. This is worth doingwherever a case of rheumatic fever appears, but it isexpensive and requires many resources.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBisno, Alan L. “Rheumatic Fever.” In Cecil Textbook of Medi-\\ncine, ed.

The procedureis done to increase blood flow and decrease long-termpain in certain diseases that cause narrowed blood ves-\\nsels. It can also be used to decrease excessive sweating.This surgical procedure cuts or destroys the sympatheticganglia, collections of nerve cell bodies in clusters alongthe thoracic or lumbar spinal cord.\\nPurpose\\nThe autonomic nervous system that controls\\nunwilled (involuntary) body functions, such as breathing,sweating, and blood pressure, are divided into the sym-pathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems. Thesympathetic nervous system speeds the heart rate, nar-rows (constricts) blood vessels, and raises blood pres-sure. Blood pressure is controlled by means of nervecells that run through sheaths around the arteries. Thesympathetic nervous system can be described as the“fight or flight” system because it allows us to respond todanger by fighting off an attacker or by running away.When danger threatens, the sympathetic nervous systemincreases heart and respiratory rate, increases blood flowKEY TERMS\\nArthralgia —Joint pain.\\nElectrocardiogram —Mapping the electrical activi-\\nty of the heart.\\nRheumatic fever —Chiefly childhood disease\\nmarked by fever, inflammation, joint pain, andSyndenham’s chorea.

The net effect isan increase in blood pressure.\\nSympathectomy is performed to relieve intermittent\\nconstricting of blood vessels ( ischemia ) when the fingers,\\ntoes, ears, or nose are exposed to cold (Raynaud’s phenom-enon). In Raynaud’s phenomenon, the affected extremitiesturn white, then blue, and red as the blood supply is cut off.The color changes are accompanied by numbness, tingling,burning, and pain. Normal color and feeling are restoredwhen heat is applied. The condition sometimes occurswithout direct cause but it is more often caused by anunderlying medical condition, such as rheumatoid arthri-\\ntis. Sympathectomy is usually less effective when Ray-\\nnaud’s is caused by an underlying medical condition. Nar-rowed blood vessels in the legs that cause painful cramping(claudication) are also treated with sympathectomy.\\nSympathectomy may be helpful in treating reflex\\nsympathetic dystrophy (RSD), a condition that some-\\ntimes develops after injury. In RSD, the affected limb ispainful (causalgia) and swollen. The color, temperature,and texture of the skin change. These symptoms arerelated to prolonged and excessive activity of the sympa-thetic nervous system.\\nBecause sweating is controlled by the sympathetic\\nnervous system, sympathectomy is also effective in treat-ing excessive sweating ( hyperhidrosis ) of the palms,\\narmpits, or face.\\nPrecautions\\nTo determine whether sympathectomy is needed, a\\nreversible block of the affected nerve cell ( ganglion )\\nshould be done. A reversible ganglion block interruptsnerve impulses by means of steroid and anesthetic inject-ed into it. If the block has a positive effect on pain andblood flow in the affected area, the sympathectomy willprobably be helpful. The surgical procedure should beperformed only if conservative treatment has not worked.Conservative treatment includes avoiding exposure tostress and cold, physical therapy, and medications.\\nSympathectomy is most likely to be effective in\\nrelieving the pain of reflex sympathetic dystrophy if it isdone soon after the injury occurs. However, increasedbenefit from early surgery should be balanced againsttime needed to promote spontaneous recovery andresponse to conservative treatment.\\nDescription\\nSympathectomy was traditionally done as an inpa-\\ntient surgical procedure under general anesthesia.

If\\nonly one arm or leg is affected, it may be treated with apercutaneous radiofrequency technique. In this technique,the surgeon locates the ganglia by a combination of x rayand electrical stimulation. The ganglia are destroyed byapplying radio waves through electrodes on the skin.\\nSympathectomy for hyperhidrosis can be done by\\nmaking a small incision under the armpit and introducingair into the chest cavity. The surgeon inserts a fiber optictube (endoscope) that projects an image of the operationon a video screen. The ganglia can then be cut with finescissors attached to the endoscope. Laser beams can alsobe used to destroy the ganglia.\\nPreparation\\nAs with any surgery, patients should discuss expect-\\ned results and possible risks with their surgeons. Theyshould tell their surgeons all medications they are takingand all their medical problems, and they should be ingood general health. To improve general health, thepatient may be asked to lose weight, give up smoking or\\nalcohol, and get the proper sleep, diet, and exercise .\\nImmediately before the surgery, patients will not be per-mitted to eat or drink, and the surgical site will becleaned and scrubbed.\\nAftercare\\nThe surgeon will inform the patient about specific\\naftercare needed for the technique used. Doppler ultra-\\nsonography , a test using sound waves to measure blood\\nflow, can help to determine whether sympathectomy hashad a positive result.\\nRisks\\nSide effects of sympathectomy may include\\ndecreased blood pressure while standing, which maycause fainting spells. After sympathectomy in men,\\nsemen is sometimes ejaculated into the bladder, whichmay impair fertility. After a sympathectomy done byinserting an endoscope in the chest cavity, patients mayexperience chest pain with deep breathing. This problemusually disappears within two weeks. They may alsoexperience pneumothorax (air in the chest cavity).\\nIn 30% of cases, surgery for hyperhidrosis may\\ncause increased sweating on the chest. In 2% of cases,this surgery causes increased sweating in other areas,including increased facial sweating while eating. Othercomplications occur less frequently. These complicationsinclude Horner’s syndrome, a condition of the nervoussystem that causes the pupil of the eye to close, the eyelidto droop, and sweating to decrease on one side of theKEY TERMS\\nCausalgia —A severe burning sensation sometimes\\naccompanied by redness and inflammation of theskin.

The range of symptoms makes iteasy to confuse syphilis with less serious diseases andignore its early signs. Acquired syphilis has four stages(primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary) and can be spreadby sexual contact during the first three of these four stages.\\nSyphilis, which is also called lues (from a Latin\\nword meaning plague ), has been a major public health\\nproblem since the sixteenth century. The disease wastreated with mercury or other ineffective remedies untilWorld War I, when effective treatments based on arsenicor bismuth were introduced. These were succeeded byantibiotics after World War II. At that time, the number\\nof cases in the general population decreased, partlybecause of aggressive public health measures. This tem-porary decrease, combined with the greater amount ofattention given to AIDS in recent years, leads some peo-\\nple to think that syphilis is no longer a serious problem.In actual fact, the number of cases of syphilis in the Unit-ed States has risen since 1980. This increase affects bothsexes, all races, all parts of the nation, and all age groups,including adults over 60. The number of women of child-bearing age with syphilis is the highest that has beenrecorded since the 1940s. About 25,000 cases of infec-tious syphilis in adults are reported annually in the Unit-ed States. It is estimated, however, that 400,000 people inthe United States need treatment for syphilis every year,and that the annual worldwide total is 50 million persons.\\nThe increased incidence of syphilis in recent years is\\nassociated with drug abuse as well as changes in sexualbehavior. The connections between drug abuse andsyphilis include needle sharing and exchanging sex fordrugs. In addition, people using drugs are more likely toengage in risky sexual practices. With respect to chang-ing patterns of conduct, a sharp increase in the number ofpeople having sex with multiple partners makes it moredifficult for public health doctors to trace the contacts ofinfected persons. High-risk groups for syphilis include:\\n• sexually active teenagers\\n• people infected with another sexually transmitted dis-\\nease (STD), including AIDS\\n• sexually abused children\\n• women of childbearing age\\n• prostitutes of either sex and their customers• prisoners• persons who abuse drugs or alcohol\\nThe chances of contracting syphilis from an infected\\nperson in the early stages of the disease during unprotect-ed sex are between 30–50%.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSyphilis is caused by a spirochete, Treponema pal-\\nlidum . A spirochete is a thin spiral- or coil-shaped bac-\\nterium that enters the body through the mucous mem-branes or breaks in the skin. In 90% of cases, the spiro-chete is transmitted by sexual contact. Transmission byblood transfusion is possible but rare; not only because\\nblood products are screened for the disease, but alsobecause the spirochetes die within 24 hours in storedblood. Other methods of transmission are highly unlikelybecause T. pallidum is easily killed by heat and drying.\\nPrimary syphilis\\nPrimary syphilis is the stage of the organism’s entry\\ninto the body. The first signs of infection are not always\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3226SyphilisGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3226'),\n",

After an incubation period ranging between 10\\nand 90 days, the patient develops a chancre, which is asmall blister-like sore about 0.5 in (13 mm) in size. Mostchancres are on the genitals, but may also develop in oron the mouth or on the breasts. Rectal chancres are com-mon in male homosexuals. Chancres in women aresometimes overlooked if they develop in the vagina or onthe cervix. The chancres are not painful and disappear inthree to six weeks even without treatment. They resem-ble the ulcers of lymphogranuloma venereum , herpes\\nsimplex virus, or skin tumors.\\nAbout 70% of patients with primary syphilis also\\ndevelop swollen lymph nodes near the chancre. Thenodes may have a firm or rubbery feel when the doctortouches them but are not usually painful.\\nSecondary syphilis\\nSyphilis enters its secondary stage between six to\\neight weeks and six months after the infection begins.Chancres may still be present but are usually healing.Secondary syphilis is a systemic infection marked by theeruption of skin rashes and ulcers in the mucous mem-\\nbranes. The skin rash may mimic a number of other skindisorders such as drug reactions, rubella ,ringworm ,\\nmononucleosis, and pityriasis rosea . Characteristics that\\npoint to syphilis include:\\n• a coppery color\\n• absence of pain or itching\\n• occurrence on the palms of hands and soles of feet\\nThe skin eruption may resolve in a few weeks or last\\nas long as a year. The patient may also develop condylo-mata lata, which are weepy pinkish or grey areas of flat-tened skin in the moist areas of the body. The skin rashes,mouth and genital ulcers, and condylomata lata are allhighly infectious.\\nAbout 50% of patients with secondary syphilis\\ndevelop swollen lymph nodes in the armpits, groin, andneck areas; about 10% develop inflammations of theeyes, kidney, liver, spleen, bones, joints, or the meninges(membranes covering the brain and spinal cord). Theymay also have a flulike general illness with a low fever ,\\nchills, loss of appetite, headaches, runny nose, sore\\nthroat , and aching joints.\\nLatent syphilis\\nLatent syphilis is a phase of the disease character-\\nized by relative absence of external symptoms. The termlatent does not mean that the disease is not progressing orthat the patient cannot infect others. For example, preg-nant women can transmit syphilis to their unborn chil-dren during the latency period.The latent phase is sometimes divided into early\\nlatency (less than two years after infection) and latelatency. During early latency, patients are at risk forspontaneous relapses marked by recurrence of the ulcersand skin rashes of secondary syphilis. In late latency,these recurrences are much less likely. Late latency mayeither resolve spontaneously or continue for the rest ofthe patient’s life.\\nTertiary syphilis\\nUntreated syphilis progresses to a third or tertiary\\nstage in about 35–40% of patients. Patients with tertiarysyphilis cannot infect others with the disease. It is thoughtthat the symptoms of this stage are a delayed hypersensi-tivity reaction to the spirochetes. Some patients developso-called benign late syphilis, which begins between threeand 10 years after infection and is characterized by thedevelopment of gummas. Gummas are rubbery tumor-like growths that are most likely to involve the skin orlong bones but may also develop in the eyes, mucousmembranes, throat, liver, or stomach lining. Gummas areincreasingly uncommon since the introduction of antibi-otics for treating syphilis. Benign late syphilis is usuallyrapid in onset and responds well to treatment.\\nCARDIOVASCULAR SYPHILIS. Cardiovascular syphilis\\noccurs in 10–15% of patients who have progressed to ter-tiary syphilis. It develops between 10 and 25 years afterinfection and often occurs together with neurosyphilis.Cardiovascular syphilis usually begins as an inflammation\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3227Syphilis\\nThis patient has secondary syphilis, evidenced by the\\nappearance of lesions on the skin.

About 8% of patients with untreat-\\ned syphilis will develop symptoms in the central nervoussystem that include both physical and psychiatric symp-toms. Neurosyphilis can appear at any time, from 5-35years after the onset of primary syphilis. It affects menmore frequently than women and Caucasians more fre-quently than African Americans.\\nNeurosyphilis is classified into four types:\\n• Asymptomatic. In this form of neurosyphilis, the\\npatient’s spinal fluid gives abnormal test results but thereare no symptoms affecting the central nervous system.\\n• Meningovascular. This type of neurosyphilis is marked\\nby changes in the blood vessels of the brain or inflam-mation of the meninges (the tissue layers covering thebrain and spinal cord). The patient develops headaches,irritability, and visual problems. If the spinal cord isinvolved, the patient may experience weakness of theshoulder and upper arm muscles.\\n• Tabes dorsalis. Tabes dorsalis is a progressive degener-\\nation of the spinal cord and nerve roots. Patients losetheir sense of perception of one’s body position and ori-entation in space (proprioception), resulting in difficul-ties walking and loss of muscle reflexes. They may alsohave shooting pains in the legs and periodic episodes ofpain in the abdomen, throat, bladder, or rectum. Tabesdorsalis is sometimes called locomotor ataxia.\\n• General paresis. General paresis refers to the effects of\\nneurosyphilis on the cortex of the brain. The patient hasa slow but progressive loss of memory, ability to con-centrate, and interest in self-care. Personality changesmay include irresponsible behavior, depression, delu-\\nsions of grandeur, or complete psychosis . General\\nparesis is sometimes called dementia paralytica, and is\\nmost common in patients over 40.\\nSpecial populations\\nCONGENITAL SYPHILIS. Congenital syphilis has\\nincreased at a rate of 400–500% over the past decade, onthe basis of criteria introduced by the Centers for DiseaseControl (CDC) in 1990. In 1994, over 2,200 cases ofcongenital syphilis were reported in the United States.The prognosis for early congenital syphilis is poor: about54% of infected fetuses die before or shortly after birth.Those who survive may look normal at birth but showsigns of infection between three and eight weeks later.\\nInfants with early congenital syphilis have systemic\\nsymptoms that resemble those of adults with secondarysyphilis. There is a 40-60% chance that the child’s cen-tral nervous system will be infected. These infants may\\nhave symptoms ranging from jaundice , enlargement of\\nthe spleen and liver, and anemia to skin rashes, condylo-mata lata, inflammation of the lungs, “snuffles” (a persis-tent runny nose), and swollen lymph nodes.\\nCHILDREN. Children who develop symptoms after\\nthe age of two years are said to have late congenitalsyphilis. The characteristic symptoms include facialdeformities (saddle nose), Hutchinson’s teeth (abnormalupper incisors), saber shins, dislocated joints, deafness,mental retardation ,paralysis , and seizure disorders.\\nPREGNANT WOMEN. Syphilis can be transmitted\\nfrom the mother to the fetus through the placenta at anytime during pregnancy , or through the child’s contact\\nwith syphilitic ulcers during the birth process. The chancesof infection are related to the stage of the mother’s disease.Almost all infants of mothers with untreated primary orsecondary syphilis will be infected, whereas the infectionrate drops to 40% if the mother is in the early latent stageand 6–14% if she has late latent syphilis.\\nPregnancy does not affect the progression of syphilis\\nin the mother; however, pregnant women should not betreated with tetracyclines .\\nHIV PATIENTS. Syphilis has been closely associated\\nwith HIV infection since the late 1980s. Syphilis some-times mimics the symptoms of AIDS. Conversely,AIDS appears to increase the severity of syphilis inpatients suffering from both diseases, and to speed upthe development or appearance of neurosyphilis.Patients with HIV are also more likely to develop luesmaligna, a skin disease that sometimes occurs in sec-ondary syphilis. Lues maligna is characterized by areasof ulcerated and dying tissue. In addition, HIV patientshave a higher rate of treatment failure with penicillinthan patients without HIV .\\nDiagnosis\\nPatient history and physical diagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of syphilis is often delayed because of\\nthe variety of early symptoms, the varying length of theincubation period, and the possibility of not noticing theinitial chancre. Patients do not always connect theirsymptoms with recent sexual contact. They may go to adermatologist when they develop the skin rash of sec-ondary syphilis rather than to their primary care doctor.Women may be diagnosed in the course of a gynecologi-cal checkup. Because of the long-term risks of untreatedsyphilis, certain groups of people are now routinelyscreened for the disease:\\n• pregnant women\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3228SyphilisGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3228'),\n",

Definite diagnosis, however,depends on the results of laboratory blood tests.\\nBlood tests\\nThere are several types of blood tests for syphilis\\npresently used in the United States. Some are used in fol-low-up monitoring of patients as well as diagnosis.\\nNONTREPONEMAL ANTIGEN TESTS. Nontreponemal\\nantigen tests are used as screeners. They measure thepresence of reagin, which is an antibody formed in reac-tion to syphilis. In the venereal disease research laborato-ry (VDRL) test, a sample of the patient’s blood is mixedwith cardiolipin and cholesterol. If the mixture formsclumps or masses of matter, the test is considered reac-tive or positive. The serum sample can be diluted severaltimes to determine the concentration of reagin in thepatient’s blood.\\nThe rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test works on the\\nsame principle as the VDRL. It is available as a kit. Thepatient’s serum is mixed with cardiolipin on a plastic-coated card that can be examined with the naked eye.\\nNontreponemal antigen tests require a doctor’s inter-\\npretation and sometimes further testing. They can yieldboth false-negative and false-positive results. False-posi-tive results can be caused by other infectious diseases,including mononucleosis, malaria ,leprosy ,rheuma-\\ntoid arthritis , and lupus. HIV patients have a particular-\\nly high rate (4%, compared to 0.8% of HIV-negativepatients) of false-positive results on reagin tests. False-negatives can occur when patients are tested too soonafter exposure to syphilis; it takes about 14-21 days afterinfection for the blood to become reactive.\\nTREPONEMAL ANTIBODY TESTS. Treponemal anti-\\nbody tests are used to rule out false-positive results onreagin tests. They measure the presence of antibodiesthat are specific for T. pallidum . The most commonly\\nused tests are the microhemagglutination- T. pallidum\\n(MHA-TP) and the fluorescent treponemal antibodyabsorption (FTA-ABS) tests. In the FTA-ABS, thepatient’s blood serum is mixed with a preparation thatprevents interference from antibodies to other trepone-\\nmal infections. The test serum is added to a slide contain-ing T. pallidum . In a positive reaction, syphilitic antibod-\\nies in the blood coat the spirochetes on the slide. Theslide is then stained with fluorescein, which causes thecoated spirochetes to fluoresce when the slide is viewedunder ultraviolet (UV) light. In the MHA-TP test, redblood cells from sheep are coated with T. pallidum anti-\\ngen. The cells will clump if the patient’s blood containsantibodies for syphilis.\\nTreponemal antibody tests are more expensive and\\nmore difficult to perform than nontreponemal tests. Theyare therefore used to confirm the diagnosis of syphilisrather than to screen large groups of people. These testsare, however, very specific and very sensitive; false-posi-tive results are relatively unusual.\\nINVESTIGATIONAL BLOOD TESTS. Currently ELISA,\\nWestern blot, and PCR testing are being studied as addi-tional diagnostic tests, particularly for congenitalsyphilis and neurosyphilis.\\nOther laboratory tests\\nMICROSCOPE STUDIES. The diagnosis of syphilis\\ncan also be confirmed by identifying spirochetes in sam-ples of tissue or lymphatic fluid. Fresh samples can bemade into slides and studied under darkfield illumina-tion. A newer method involves preparing slides fromdried fluid smears and staining them with fluorescein forviewing under UV light. This method is replacing dark-field examination because the slides can be mailed toprofessional laboratories.\\nSPINAL FLUID TESTS. Testing of cerebrospinal fluid\\n(CSF) is an important part of patient monitoring as wellas a diagnostic test. The VDRL and FTA-ABS tests canbe performed on CSF as well as on blood. An abnormallyhigh white cell count and elevated protein levels in theCSF, together with positive VDRL results, suggest a pos-sible diagnosis of neurosyphilis. CSF testing is not usedfor routine screening. It is used most frequently forinfants with congenital syphilis, HIV-positive patients,and patients of any age who are not responding to peni-cillin treatment.\\nTreatment\\nMedications\\nSyphilis is treated with antibiotics given either intra-\\nmuscularly (benzathine penicillin G or ceftriaxone) ororally (doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline, orazithromycin). Neurosyphilis is treated with a combina-tion of aqueous crystalline penicillin G, benzathine peni-cillin G, or doxycycline. It is important to keep the levels\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3229SyphilisGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3229'),\n",

Peni-cillin is more effective in treating the early stages ofsyphilis than the later stages.\\nDoctors do not usually prescribe separate medica-\\ntions for the skin rashes or ulcers of secondary syphilis.The patient is advised to keep them clean and dry, and toavoid exposing others to fluid or discharges from condy-lomata lata.\\nPregnant women should be treated as early in preg-\\nnancy as possible. Infected fetuses can be cured if themother is treated during the second and third trimestersof pregnancy. Infants with proven or suspected congeni-tal syphilis are treated with either aqueous crystallinepenicillin G or aqueous procaine penicillin G. Childrenwho acquire syphilis after birth are treated with benza-thine penicillin G.\\nJarisch-Herxheimer reaction\\nThe Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, first described in\\n1895, is a reaction to penicillin treatment that may occurduring the late primary, secondary, or early latent stages.The patient develops chills, fever, headache , and muscle\\npains within two to six hours after the penicillin is inject-ed. The chancre or rash gets temporarily worse. TheJarisch-Herxheimer reaction, which lasts about a day, isthought to be an allergic reaction to toxins released whenthe penicillin kills massive numbers of spirochetes.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAntibiotics are essential for the treatment of\\nsyphilis. Recovery from the disease can be assisted bydietary changes, sleep, exercise , and stress reduction .\\nHomeopathy\\nHomeopathic practitioners are forbidden by law in\\nthe United States to claim that homeopathic treatmentcan cure syphilis. Given the high rate of syphilis in HIV-positive patients, however, some alternative practitionerswho are treating AIDS patients with homeopathic reme-dies maintain that they are beneficial for syphilis as well.The remedies suggested most frequently are Medor-\\nrhinum ,Syphilinum ,Mercurius vivus , and Aurum . The\\nhistorical link between homeopathy and syphilis is Hah-\\nnemann’s theory of miasms. He thought that thesyphilitic miasm was the second oldest cause of constitu-tional weakness in humans.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis is good for the early stages of syphilis\\nif the patient is treated promptly and given sufficientlylarge doses of antibiotics. Treatment failures can occur\\nand patients can be reinfected. There are no definite cri-teria for cure for patients with primary and secondarysyphilis, although patients who are symptom-free andhave had negative blood tests for two years after treat-ment are usually considered cured. Patients should befollowed up with blood tests at one, three, six, and 12months after treatment, or until the results are negative.CSF should be examined after one year. Patients withrecurrences during the latency period should be tested forreinfection.\\nThe prognosis for patients with untreated syphilis is\\nspontaneous remission for about 30%; lifelong latencyfor another 30%; and potentially fatal tertiary forms ofthe disease in 40%.\\nPrevention\\nImmunity\\nPatients with syphilis do not acquire lasting immuni-\\nty against the disease. Currently no effective vaccine forsyphilis has been developed. Prevention depends on acombination of personal and public health measures.\\nLifestyle choices\\nThe only reliable methods for preventing transmis-\\nsion of syphilis are sexual abstinence or monogamousrelationships between uninfected partners. Condomsoffer some protection but protect only the covered partsof the body.\\nPublic health measures\\nCONTACT TRACING. The law requires reporting of\\nsyphilis cases to public health agencies. Sexual contactsof patients diagnosed with syphilis are traced and testedfor the disease. This includes all contacts for the pastthree months in cases of primary syphilis and for the pastyear in cases of secondary disease. Neither the patientsnor their contacts should have sex with anyone until theyhave been tested and treated.\\nAll patients who test positive for syphilis should be\\ntested for HIV infection at the time of diagnosis.\\nPRENATAL TESTING OF PREGNANT WOMEN. Preg-\\nnant women should be tested for syphilis at the time oftheir first visit for prenatal care, and again shortly beforedelivery. Proper treatment of secondary syphilis in themother reduces the risk of congenital syphilis in theinfant from 90% to less than 2%.\\nEDUCATION AND INFORMATION.

Antibod-ies are special immune cells that recognize these foreigninvaders, and begin a chain of events to destroy them. Inan autoimmune disorder like SLE, a person’s antibodiesbegin to recognize the body’s own tissues as foreign.Cells and chemicals of the immune system damage thetissues of the body. The reaction that occurs in tissue iscalled inflammation. Inflammation includes swelling,redness, increased blood flow, and tissue destruction.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3231Systemic lupus erythematosusGEM -2931 to 3236 - S  10/22/03 6:18 PM  Page 3231'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/gale_encyclopedia_of_medicine_vol4.pdf', 'page': 936}, page_content='In SLE, some of the common antibodies that nor-\\nmally fight diseases are thought to be out of control.These include antinuclear antibodies and anti-DNA anti-bodies. Antinuclear antibodies are directed against thecell’s central structure that contains genetic material (thenucleus). Anti-DNA antibodies are directed against thecell’s genetic material. DNA is the chemical substancethat makes up the chromosomes and genes.\\nSLE can occur in both males and females of all ages,\\nbut 90% of patients are women. The majority of thesewomen are in their childbearing years. African Ameri-cans are more likely than Caucasians to develop SLE.\\nOccasionally, medications can cause a syndrome of\\nsymptoms very similar to SLE. This is called drug-induced lupus. Medications that may cause this syn-drome include hydralazine (used for high blood pressure)and procainamide (used for abnormal heartbeats). Drug-induced lupus almost always disappears after the patientstops taking the medications that caused it.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of SLE is unknown. Because the vast\\nmajority of patients are women, some research is beingdone to determine what (if any) link the disease has to\\nfemale hormones. SLE may have a genetic basis,although more than one gene is believed to be involved inthe development of the disease. Because patients with thedisease may suddenly have worse symptoms (called aflare) after exposure to things like sunlight, alfalfasprouts, and certain medications, researchers suspect thatsome environmental factors may also be at work.\\nThe severity of a patient’s SLE varies over time.\\nPatients may have periods with mild or no symptoms,followed by a flare. During a flare, symptoms increase inseverity and new organ systems may become affected.\\nMany SLE patients have fevers, fatigue , muscle\\npain , weakness, decreased appetite, and weight loss.

A discoid, or coin-shaped, rash causes red, scalybumps on the cheeks, nose, scalp, ears, chest, back, andthe tops of the arms and legs. The roof of the mouthmay develop sore, irritated pits (ulcers). Hair loss iscommon. SLE patients tend to be very easily sunburned(photosensitive).\\n• Lungs. Inflammation of the tissues that cover the lungs\\nand line the chest cavity causes pleuritis, with fluidaccumulating in the lungs. The patient frequently expe-riences coughing and shortness of breath.\\n• Heart and circulatory system. Inflammation of the tissue\\nsurrounding the heart causes pericarditis ; inflammation\\nof the heart itself causes myocarditis . These heart prob-\\nlems may result in abnormal beats ( arrhythmias ), diffi-\\nculty pumping the blood strongly enough ( heart\\nfailure ), or even sudden death . Blood clots often form\\nin the blood vessels and may lead to complications.\\n• Nervous system. Headaches, seizures, changes in per-\\nsonality, and confused thinking ( psychosis ) may occur.\\n• Kidneys. The kidneys may suffer significant destruc-\\ntion, with serious life-threatening effects. They maybecome unable to adequately filter the blood, leading tokidney failure.\\n• Gastrointestinal system. Patients may experience nau-\\nsea, vomiting, diarrhea , and abdominal pain. The lin-\\ning of the abdomen may become inflamed (peritonitis).\\n• Eyes. The eyes may become red, sore, and dry. Inflam-\\nmation of one of the nerves responsible for vision maycause vision problems, and blindness can result frominflammation of the blood vessels ( vasculitis ) that\\nserve the retina.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of SLE can be somewhat difficult. There\\nare no definitive tests for diagnosing SLE. Many of thesymptoms and laboratory test results of SLE patients aresimilar to those of patients with different diseases,including rheumatoid arthritis ,multiple sclerosis , and\\nvarious nervous system and blood disorders.\\nLaboratory tests that are helpful in diagnosing SLE\\ninclude several tests for a variety of antibodies common-ly elevated in SLE patients (including antinuclear anti-bodies, anti-DNA antibodies, etc.). SLE patients tend tohave low numbers of red blood cells (anemia) and lownumbers of certain types of white blood cells. The ery-\\nthrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), a measure of\\ninflammation in the body, tends to be quite elevated.Samples of tissue (biopsies) from affected skin and kid-neys show characteristics of the disease.A test called the lupus erythematosus cell preparation\\n(or LE prep) test is also performed. This test involvesobtaining a sample of the patient’s blood. Cells from theblood are damaged in the laboratory in order to harvesttheir nuclei. These damaged cells are then put together withthe patient’s blood serum, the liquid part of blood separatedfrom the blood cells. Antinuclear antibodies within thepatient’s serum will clump together with the damagednuclear material. A material called Wright’s stain willcause these clumps to turn blue. These stained clumps arethen reacted with some of the patient’s white blood cells,which will essentially eat the clumps. LE cells are thewhite blood cells that contain the blue clumps. This testwill be positive in about 70-80% of all patients with SLE.\\nThe American Rheumatism Association developed a\\nlist of symptoms used to diagnose SLE. Research sup-ports the idea that people who have at least four of theeleven criteria (not necessarily simultaneously) areextremely likely to have SLE. The criteria are:\\n• butterfly rash\\n• discoid rash\\n• photosensitivity\\n• mouth ulcers\\n• arthritis\\n• inflammation of the lining of the lungs or the lining\\naround the heart\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 3233Systemic lupus erythematosus\\nA close-up view of a woman’s face with a lesion caused by\\nsystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Some patients have amild form of SLE. Their mild symptoms of inflammationcan be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\\ndrugs like ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) and aspirin . Severe\\nskin rashes and joint problems may respond to a group ofmedications usually used to treat malaria . More severely\\nill patients with potentially life-threatening complica-tions (including kidney disease, pericarditis, or nervoussystem complications) will require treatment with morepotent drugs, including steroid medications. Becausesteroids have serious side effects, they are reserved formore severe cases of SLE. Drugs that decrease the activi-ty of the immune system (called immunosuppressant\\ndrugs ) may also be used for severely ill SLE patients.\\nThese include azathioprine and cyclophosphamide.\\nOther treatments for SLE try to help specific symp-\\ntoms. Clotting disorders will require blood thinners. Psy-chotic disorders will require specific medications. Kid-ney failure may require the blood to be cleaned outsidethe body through a machine (dialysis) or even a kidney\\ntransplantation .\\nAlternative treatment\\nA number of alternative treatments have been sug-\\ngested to help reduce the symptoms of SLE. Theseinclude acupuncture and massage for relieving the pain\\nof sore joints and muscles. Stress management is key for\\npeople with SLE and such techniques as meditation ,\\nhynotherapy, and yoga may be helpful in promoting\\nrelaxation. Dietary suggestions include eating a wholefoods diet with reduced amounts of red meat and dairyproducts in order to decrease pain and inflammation.Food allergies are believed either to contribute to SLE or\\nto arise as a consequence of the digestive difficulties.Wheat, dairy products, and soy are the major offenders.An elimination/challenge diet can help identify theoffending foods so that they can be avoided. Anotherdietary measure that may be beneficial is eating morefish that contain omega-3 fatty acids, like mackerel, sar-dines, and salmon. Because alfalfa sprouts have beenassociated with the onset of flares in SLE, they should be\\navoided. Supplements that have been suggested toimprove the health of SLE patients include vitamins B,\\nC, and E, as well as selenium, zinc, magnesium, and acomplete trace mineral supplement. Vitamin A isbelieved to help improve discoid skin rashes. Botanicalmedicine can help the entire body through immune mod-ulation and detoxification , as well as assisting individual\\norgans and systems. Homeopathy and flower essences\\ncan work deeply on the emotional level to help peoplewith this difficult disease.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for patients with SLE varies, depend-\\ning on the organ systems most affected and the severityof inflammation. Some patients have long periods oftime with mild or no symptoms. About 90-95% ofpatients are still living after 2 years with the disease.About 82-90% of patients are still living after 5 yearswith the disease. After 10 years, 71-80% of patients arestill alive, and 63-75% are still alive after 20 years. Themost likely causes of death during the first 10 yearsinclude infections and kidney failure. During years 11-20of the disease, the most likely cause of death involves thedevelopment of abnormal blood clots.\\nBecause SLE frequently affects women of child-\\nbearing age, pregnancy is an important issue. For preg-\\nnant SLE patients, about 30% of the pregnancies end inmiscarriage . About 25% of all babies born to mothers\\nwith SLE are premature. Most babies born to motherswith SLE are normal. However, a rare condition calledneonatal lupus causes a baby of a mother with SLE todevelop a skin rash, liver or blood problems, and a seri-ous heart condition.\\nPrevention\\nThere are no known ways to avoid developing SLE.\\nHowever, it is possible for a patient who has been diag-nosed with SLE to prevent flares of the disease. Recom-mendations for improving general health to avoid flaresinclude decreasing sun exposure, getting sufficient sleep,eating a healthy diet, decreasing stress, and exercising reg-ularly. It is important for a patient to try to identify theearly signs of a flare (like fever , increased fatigue, rash,\\nheadache ). Some people believe that noticing and\\nresponding to these warning signs will allow a patient withSLE to prevent a flare, or at least to decrease its severity.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAaseng, Nathan.
